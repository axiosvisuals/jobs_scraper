MIO performs asset class-specific and cross-asset class market research as well as macroeconomic research as part of its process for assessing investment opportunities and deciding how to manage our portfolios’ exposures. This includes monitoring economic conditions worldwide and understanding how they compare with history, understanding historical asset returns and monitoring current asset pricing, and quantifying relationships between economic conditions and market performance. The asset classes we cover include equities, fixed income, credit, commodities, and FX, among others.


**Position**  

Our Quantitative Research Analyst program is designed for those who aspire to pursue an investment management career at MIO. This position will not be a good fit (professionally or financially) if you are not willing to commit for at least 3-5 years or if you are not interested in quantitative modeling and financial markets.


**Primary responsibilities**  

The Quantitative Research Analyst will be responsible for supporting tasks related to creating new research and maintaining existing research. Their principal duties will include:


* Understanding the quantitative research topic agenda, quickly gaining familiarity, and starting to develop content-area expertise
* Working with a Portfolio Manager and/or Investment Research Manager in setting the conceptual and technical approaches, finding, and selecting raw data inputs, and producing the research outputs (for example, an ongoing dashboard monitoring a relationship or a one-time white paper determining the nature of a relationship), and documenting the research methodology
* Ownership over existing body of research, thoroughly understanding the content, making substantial content improvements (i.e., insights, usability, visual quality), managing and improving the processes for keeping our research output updated (e.g., automating and systematizing the production of ongoing research). Wherever possible, integrate research so that insights from one research can be used to improve other research or combined to produce new insights.
* Actively assist in systematizing MIO’s quantitative research, including standardizing research production and developing/managing a portion of MIO’s quantitative research database (including metadata maintenance and streamlining), at times working closely with the Investment IT team. Optimizing macroeconomic and financial data sourcing across the organization.
* Potentially supporting Portfolio Managers and/or Investment Research Managers in implementing and monitoring trades to provide perspective on and validation of their strategies and hypotheses


**Desired background**  

The most important qualities for Quantitative Research Analysts are their strong analytical thinking abilities and their tangible skills, such as programming and data analytics. However, their desire to produce high-quality output, openness to new ideas, and their affinity for a values-oriented (rather than profit-driven) environment, in which the best interests of our investors are placed above personal objectives, are also paramount to success in the position.


The Quantitative Research Analyst will need to be comfortable manipulating large datasets and then drawing intuitive conclusions from them. They must be able to present findings graphically and intuitively to a non-technical audience. Strong communication skills are critical. A focus on drawing practical conclusions will be more important than theoretical rigor.


Prior knowledge and experience with financial markets and/or macroeconomic concepts, terminology, and data would be helpful in enabling the candidate to quickly learn our existing research and be more immediately productive in creating new research.


The candidate’s background will ideally include:


* 0-2.5 years of professional work experience strongly preferred, not required
* Undergraduate degree with a record of outstanding academic achievement (required)
* Coursework in financial engineering, business, and economics is highly desirable (and may be required for certain roles)
* Comfortable and proficient with a programming language (e.g., Python, C++); highly proficient in Excel and VBA; proficiency in MATLAB, R, and/or Tableau (or any other data visualization packages) is helpful although not required
* Working knowledge of Bloomberg; knowledge of other industry-standard macroeconomic and financial market data sources (e.g., IHS Global Insights, Markit, Haver, Thomson Reuters DataStream, S&P Capital IQ, Moody’s Economy.com)


In addition, a successful candidate will possess the following personal attributes:


* Attention to detail; a strong dedication to producing error-free work

Learning Ally is a leading nonprofit education solutions organization that transforms the lives of struggling learners by delivering proven literacy solutions that help students reach their potential. Its mission is to radically change education, transforming the lives of children by providing reading interventions and solutions to help them succeed academically, build self-confidence, and thrive in school and beyond.


65% of fourth graders read below proficiency and are 400% more likely to drop-out of high school. And, for “most at risk” students (students of color, low income, English Language Learners and students with learning disabilities) the problem is even more acute.


Learning Ally seeks to break this cycle. With early student assessment, intervention and accommodation and professional development for educators, Learning Ally can identify and prevent learning issues by working with schools and educators to support new and struggling readers. Our solutions build a strong foundation for independent, engaged learners who are empowered to achieve socially, emotionally, and academically, regardless of background or learning difference.


Founded in 1948 as Recording for the Blind, to help soldiers who lost their sight in combat continue their education with audiobook products, Learning Ally has evolved to help individuals understand the unique ways they learn and match them to the solutions that enable personal achievement.


Today, Learning Ally reaches over 2,300,000 students, 615,000 educators and 23,000 schools across the country and continues to expand its reach. With a continued commitment to supporting students who learn differently, Learning Ally has joined researchers and neuroscientists from renowned institutions including UCSF and MIT, to better understand and address learning issues.

Are you looking for a job where you can use your experience to propel your career into management? At New York Life, we will invest in you from the start to help you learn and grow as a financial professional first. We’ll train you in valuable skills, such as marketing, business development, and customer relationship management, and provide you with the tools you need to further your career. Then we’ll train you and provide you with access to the tools you need for a career in management.

**What we’re looking for**  
We’re looking for people who want to make a lasting impact on the financial well-being of individuals, families, and small businesses—motivated people who can answer yes to one of the following questions:

* Do you have sales or managerial experience in another industry?
* Have you previously run your own business?
* Do you have an MBA or other equivalent degree?

In the Accelerated Path to Management Program, you’ll start off as a financial professional, learning how to sell our products, building client relationships, and meeting specific requirements1 before transitioning into a management role.  
You’ll then undergo a six-month intensive training program designed to prime you for success as a manager. You will use that experience to understand how to recruit and coach others to success.

**What we offer**

**Your first year**  
You’ll learn firsthand about a financial professional’s role and day-to-day work by working as a financial professional for the first year of your career journey with New York Life. We will provide you with complete training, access to digital tools, and a comprehensive product suite.

**Training and resources**  
You will receive top-notch training that will give you an understanding and appreciation for the strength and value of  
New York Life. Beyond this training and support, New York Life will provide access to the resources you need to succeed day-to-day, including experts on hand to answer your questions and a suite of digital sales, prospecting and marketing tools that will help you attract and retain your clients with web, social and email content.

**Product Solutions**  
You will learn about our robust products and services that can help clients and their families achieve their financial goals.  
Together with its subsidiaries, New York Life provides a range of competitive insurance and financial products, including life insurance, annuities, long-term care insurance, disability income insurance, and investment products such as mutual funds through our broker-dealer, NYLIFE Securities LLC (member of FINRA and SIPC), a Licensed Insurance  
Agency. You will be required to hold securities licenses and FINRA registrations and affiliate with NYLIFE Securities as a registered representative before you can offer investment products.

**Your transition to a Field Manager role**  
After meeting specific requirements for the first 12 months as a financial professional, you will enter a specialized six-month Associate Partner training program. We’ll help you to lead and build your team of financial professionals.  
Throughout your career journey with New York Life, you’ll continue to have opportunities to grow and be promoted to increasingly senior levels of management.

**How we will compensate you**  
When you begin with New York Life as a financial professional, you will receive income that is performance-based.

If you meet the requirements and approvals to become an Associate Partner, you will receive a salary. The salary range for an Associate Partner is $60,000–$150,000 (in California, the salary range is $62,400–$150,000), plus you will be eligible for additional compensation related to the agents you recruit and develop (“R&Ds”). R&Ds are additional compensation that is designed to increase your income and to reimburse for any reasonable and necessary expenses we do not otherwise reimburse. You will also be eligible for medical, dental, and vision benefits, life, long-term disability, and accidental death and dismemberment coverages, a pension plan, and a 401(k) savings plan.

New York Life will value and reward your hard work and success. You’ll have significant income potential over time, because our field managers’ compensation is directly aligned with their recruiting performance and the production level of their team of financial professionals. The average income among our 586 recruiters at all levels in 2021 was $270,890.6
