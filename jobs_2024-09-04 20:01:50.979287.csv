**SUMMARY**


The focus of this job is making connections with people, motivating and inspiring them to achieve results. Poise and an engaging, empathetic communication style based on natural warmth and enthusiasm are the keys to achieving the goals of this job. The work involves driving toward results by enrolling the commitment and buy-in of others. While the job requires strong initiative and self-direction, results are only achieved with and through people. A sincere appreciation for people and how they are each uniquely motivated is the foundation for designing and implementing interactive communication and decision-making processes. Knowledge and skill in successfully influencing and persuading others by understanding how their individual needs and motivations link to goals are essential. The job requires a high degree of “selling,” whether of ideas and policies within the organization or products or services in the marketplace. The job environment is fast-paced and results-oriented. While there is an urgency to goal achievement, responsibility for achieving results needs to be shared and effectively delegated when necessary. Initiating projects and processes beyond established organizational practices will often require training and developing others and enlisting their support using a “selling” rather than “telling” communication style. A self-confident, extroverted style that can enliven, engage, and positively impact individuals and groups is essential. The job has a variety of tasks and is dynamic and changing. Because goals and desired results can quickly change, the job requires regularly meeting and proactively establishing relationships with new groups. Understanding, quickly reacting, and motivating others to adapt to the changing organizational environment are critical to success. In general, the core of this position requires a motivated team builder and organization developer.

**JOB CHARACTERISTICS**

* Variety of activities Multiple projects occurring simultaneously Multi-tasking Sense of urgency for goal achievement Fast-paced environment
* People/relationships focus Team building Inspire, motivate others, and engage their commitment
* Involve others in the decision-making process, cooperative, collaborative decision-making. Must assume responsibility for risk

* When multiple leaders are scheduled for a shift, the manager may have to assume the responsibilities of a regular team member.

**Work Environment**


The work hours can be long and physically demanding, so employees may find the job tiring. The restaurant environment is likely to be noisy and busy, which can all be stressful. Managers and other members of the leadership team are also on their feet for most of the shift, so comfortable shoes need to be worn, and the job is not suitable for anyone with back problems. Stamina and physical strength are also important, as employees are expected to lift and carry heavy items regularly (at least 25 lbs). Leaders may be expected to start work very early or work at night. Team morale and positivity are very important and a part of the Chick-fil-A culture.


Working at a Chick-fil-A® restaurant is more than a job – it’s an opportunity for teamwork and leadership development in a positive, people-focused environment. Most Chick-fil-A restaurants are locally owned and operated by independent, franchised Operators who invest in the future of their Team Members and give back to their communities.

RESUMEN


El enfoque de este trabajo es establecer conexiones con las personas, motivarlas e inspirarlas para lograr resultados. El aplomo y un estilo de comunicación atractivo y empático basado en la calidez natural y el entusiasmo son las claves para lograr los objetivos de este trabajo. El trabajo consiste en impulsar la obtención de resultados mediante la inscripción del compromiso y la aceptación de los demás. Si bien el trabajo requiere una fuerte iniciativa y autodirección, los resultados solo se logran con y a través de las personas. Un aprecio sincero por las personas y por la forma en que cada una de ellas está motivada de manera única es la base para diseñar e implementar procesos interactivos de comunicación y toma de decisiones. El conocimiento y la habilidad para influir y persuadir con éxito a los demás mediante la comprensión de cómo sus necesidades y motivaciones individuales se vinculan con los objetivos son esenciales. El trabajo requiere un alto grado de \\venta\\, ya sea de ideas y políticas dentro de la organización o de productos o servicios en el mercado. El entorno de trabajo es acelerado y orientado a resultados. Si bien es urgente alcanzar los objetivos, la responsabilidad de lograr resultados debe compartirse y delegarse eficazmente cuando sea necesario. Iniciar proyectos y procesos más allá de las prácticas organizacionales establecidas a menudo requerirá capacitar y desarrollar a otros y obtener su apoyo utilizando un estilo de comunicación de \\venta\\ en lugar de \\decir\\. Es esencial un estilo extrovertido y seguro de sí mismo que pueda animar, involucrar e impactar positivamente a individuos y grupos. El trabajo tiene una variedad de tareas y es dinámico y cambiante. Debido a que los objetivos y los resultados deseados pueden cambiar rápidamente, el trabajo requiere reunirse regularmente y establecer relaciones de manera proactiva con nuevos grupos. Comprender, reaccionar rápidamente y motivar a los demás para que se adapten al entorno organizacional cambiante es fundamental para el éxito. En general, el núcleo de este puesto requiere un constructor de equipos motivado y un desarrollador de la organización.

* Las horas no están garantizadas, pero se asignan de manera predecible de acuerdo con la Ley de Semana Laboral Justa de la Ciudad de Nueva York. Las horas están sujetas a cambios en función de las necesidades comerciales y se asignan en función de la disponibilidad, el rendimiento laboral y la confiabilidad de una persona.
* Puede trabajar un mínimo de 35 horas a la semana, pero no más de 45 a la semana
* Es responsabilidad del empleado controlar las horas semanales. Cualquier hora extra no aprobada está sujeta a medidas disciplinarias y/o despido
* Debe estar disponible para trabajar los sábados
* Cuando se programan varios líderes para un turno, es posible que el gerente tenga que asumir las responsabilidades de un miembro regular del equipo.

**Ambiente laboral**


Las horas de trabajo pueden ser largas y físicamente exigentes, por lo que los empleados pueden encontrar el trabajo agotador. Es probable que el ambiente del restaurante sea ruidoso y concurrido, lo que puede ser estresante. Los gerentes y otros miembros del equipo de liderazgo también están de pie durante la mayor parte del turno, por lo que se deben usar zapatos cómodos y el trabajo no es adecuado para personas con problemas de espalda. La resistencia y la fuerza física también son importantes, ya que se espera que los empleados levanten y carguen artículos pesados con regularidad (al menos 25 libras). Se puede esperar que los líderes comiencen a trabajar muy temprano o trabajen de noche. La moral y la positividad del equipo son muy importantes y forman parte de la cultura de Chick-fil-A.


Trabajar en un restaurante Chick-fil-A® es más que un trabajo: es una oportunidad para el trabajo en equipo y el desarrollo del liderazgo en un entorno positivo y centrado en las personas. La mayoría de los restaurantes Chick-fil-A son de propiedad local y están operados por operadores independientes y franquiciados que invierten en el futuro de los miembros de su equipo y retribuyen a sus comunidades.

The world of work is changing…short commutes, flexibility, and convenience are the minimum standards employees want when it comes to how they want to work!



At IWG, we are leading the way. We’ve built the world’s largest workspace network so that our customers can work from wherever, and however, they want… in over 120 countries across the globe!



Join us and help us bring more freedom to people and businesses, while expanding our network. You’ll be able to enjoy a great work life balance and competitive benefits, while growing your career path along the way.

  


**The opportunity**



As a Community Associate, you’ll work closely with new and existing customers across a myriad of industries, working to create and maintain your own community within your center, where you will help take care of all the administrative and support needs for your customers…so that your customers can focus on running their business.

  


**A typical day at IWG**

You arrive a few minutes before your center opens to make sure everything is ready and check there’s nothing the cleaners have missed.



Customers arrive all throughout the morning. One asks you for a changed WiFi code. Another wants to know if his important package has arrived. A woman needs directions to her meeting room… and can you help her set up the projector and show her where to find a great cup of coffee. You’re off to help her get set-up, as soon as you connect the incoming call to another customer. You may sure that all of the services are properly charged, so that invoices are accurate.



It’s time for a quick coffee break, relax and enjoy a few minutes to yourself.



The mail arrives. You sort through it while dealing with a whole host of other customer requests, remembering to email the customer from earlier to let him know his package is waiting for him in his mailbox. And that’s lunch.



A new wave of customers arrive throughout the afternoon. You help a customer with printing and another with their invoice. A customer in a team room say it’s too hot in their office, no problem you are on it and open a ticket in our service portal.



You’ve earned yourself another quick coffee break, relax and enjoy a few minutes to yourself.



Early afternoon, you sit down with the Community Manager to discuss the organization of next week’s networking event in your center. You plan and write the e-invites to customers, then create, print and put-up posters on the noticeboards around the center. To your excitement, the Community Manager is coming around the corner with a prospect (someone interested in joining the IWG community), you share a few details about what makes this space so amazing for your customers and encourage them to join the network soon so they can participate in next week’s networking event – then you head back to finish putting up your posters.



The day is coming to a close. Time to gently ask the large group in meeting room 3 to start wrapping up. You direct them to the nice restaurant you know around the corner, so they can grab a bite and continue their discussion. You ensure everything’s nice and tidy, it’s time to head home.

  


**About you**



We’re looking for someone who knows how to manage multiple tasks while providing customers with the best possible service. You also need to be:


* A good communicator, with the ability to build strong professional relationships and empathize with people’s needs (Ideally 1+ years of customer service experience)
* Happy taking ownership of problems and finding ways to solve them
* Positive, enthusiastic, and able to adapt to fast-changing situations
* Experience and confidence using MS Office and other basic IT equipment
* Legally eligible to work in the Country you are applying within and at least 18 years old
  


 **What we offer**



On top of a competitive total compensation package, you’ll enjoy:


* Work life balance (no standard nights/weekends)
* Generous paid time off plans (sick and vacation)
* 11 Paid Company Holidays per calendar year (in addition to your PTO accrual)
* Competitive 401K Program, with a Company match
* Affordable and comprehensive health care for all full-time team members (and some plan options for part-timers as well)
* A quarterly bonus plan program, plus an hourly rate of $17.62

The minimum and maximum base hourly wage for this position is $19.88. This base pay does not include additional forms of compensation including bonuses, overtime, etc. **Role Description**


The purpose of a Medical Scribe at Oak Street Health is to support our primary care providers with clinical documentation so that they can focus on providing exceptional care to our patients. Scribes assist providers throughout the patient care journey - huddling each morning to plan for the day's visits, joining them in the exam room to observe and document, and touching base after the visit to assist with next steps.

  

Beyond the typical Scribe role, these important care team members serve as clinical documentation assistants to their paired provider. Internally, we call them CISs (Clinic Informatics Specialists) in recognition of their important role in supporting accurate, specific, and timely clinical documentation. In addition to observing and documenting all patient encounters in real time, our Scribes become experts in our value-based care model and the documentation and care of chronic conditions, including ICD-10 and CPT coding. Scribes use this expertise to help providers identify and help close care gaps. Scribes receive extensive on-the-job training in clinical workflows, value-based medicine, preventative care for chronic conditions, accurate and specific documentation, population health data streams, and team based care.

  

Because our patients and providers rely on our Scribes, the ideal candidate should commit at least 1-2 years to this role. This is an excellent opportunity for pre-med track individuals looking to gain practical, paid experience in a clinical setting before applying to an MD/DO/PA/NP program, as well as those pursuing careers in Health Informatics, Public Health, Healthcare Administration, Medical Coding, and other related fields.

**ABOUT MIELE**



What does it take for a family run company to become world market leader in the premium domestic appliance and commercial machine segment? It takes more than offering average products, run-of-the-mill service or short-sighted actions. It also requires the aspiration to do it forever better and to be forever better. This stance accounts for a good working environment at Miele and the success of our products.



Our colleagues can rest assured that those who live up to our standards of quality and professionalism grow personally and professionally. No matter if they are at entry levels or managers.



Miele asks a lot of its employees. They are expected to develop and manufacture worldwide market premium products that are ""Immer Besser"". In return, they receive the most valuable thing Miele can give them: that they themselves become ""Immer Besser"" - in all of their professional and personal abilities.



""Immer Besser"" is therefore an entrepreneurial success principle from which customers and employees benefit in equal measure. We call this principle ""MAKE IT BETTER. BE BETTER"".
