For more information about our benefits, see below!

We are proud to be a member of the Rentokil family of companies, the global leader in Pest Control and other services across more than 90 countries. We pride ourselves on being a trusted partner to many of the world's leading brands and serve consumer and business customers across multiple industries. We are extremely proud of our legacy of excellence and constantly work to fulfill our mission to ""protect people, enhance lives, and preserve the planet.""

**Creepy crawlies and contented customers. Intrigued?** **You might be just who we're looking for.**

Busting bugs has its benefits. Company-provided truck, gas, and phone. Benefits including a 401(k) with a company match. Amazing earning potential. But it’s more than that. It’s serving with a smile. It’s having your teammates’ backs. It’s going above and beyond and making a difference. We step in and step up when people have problems they can’t fix, and they need the pros. We crush their pest problems and lift their spirits.

Back to you. Are you a hard worker? Can you follow direction, adapt to change, and solve problems? Are you organized, friendly, and motivated to succeed? That’s a great place to start.

**As a Pest Control Technician, here’s what you can expect** 

* You won’t be tied to a desk. You’ll be out and about — mobile, independent, and growing your career with a clear view of next steps. You’ll be the face of Terminix to your local community (with the backing of a national brand), and your clients will count on you to protect their businesses, their homes, and their families.
* When you first join Terminix Nation, you’ll spend a few months in training. Once you’ve got that and some state required licenses and certificates under your belt, you’ll take the lead with your own customers.
* You’ll get rewarded with competitive pay and robust benefits to cover you and your family. As a teammate, you will be eligible for a 401(k) with company match, company-paid life insurance, tuition reimbursement, and a generous student loan repayment program. You put in the work, and you’ll reap the rewards.
* You’ll be part of a community — bonus points if you’re already a leader in yours. Our bonds are strong at Terminix Nation and the relationships we develop in the communities we serve are unparalleled. Our teammates give back through volunteering, donations, scholarships, and more.
* You’ll be onboarded and trained by the best of ‘em. You’ll get paid to get licensed, something you’ll have for a lifetime. You’ll know how to bust bugs at home, too.

**What your days will look like**

* Roll up your sleeves and get ready to learn how we take care of customers. You’ll become an expert in applying our company products so they’re safe and effective.
* Are you a good driver? As a technician, your office is the cab of your Terminix truck. You’ll use it on calls and take it home, too. Same goes for your Terminix phone. We trust our technicians.
* You’ll be responsible for building relationships with customers, scheduling and confirming their appointments, helping with sales to current customers, and expanding our product to new customers.
* Does technology scare you? That’s okay. We provide training and support to ensure you’re comfortable using state-of-the-art tools. You’ll also need to have strong communication skills so that you can email, text, call, talk, and write effectively. Oh, and sometimes there’s paperwork.
* There’s an opportunity to grow into a role you’re passionate about and fits your skillset — whether that’s management, a move to sales, or another opportunity at Terminix.

**Some non-negotiables**

There are some things you’ll just need to have or know to join Terminix Nation as a Pest Control Technician.

* High school diploma or GED; or one to three months related experience and/or training; or equivalent combination of education and experience.
* Solid reading, writing, and verbal communication skills and the ability to present information in both internal and external settings.
* Some basic math skills — add, subtract, multiply, and divide in all units of measure, using whole numbers, common fractions, and decimals. You’ll need to be able to follow instructions for mixing on product labels.
* With the help of Terminix (and with the company footing the bill), you’ll need to maintain the licenses/certificates as required by federal, state, and/or local regulations. And you’ll need a valid driver’s license.

**Straight talk about the physical demands of our work**

We’re not going to sugarcoat it. The essential functions of this job have some physical demands (of course, reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the essential functions.) Here’s what we mean:

* You’ve got to be able to move up to 10 lbs. regularly and 11–20 lbs. frequently, whether that’s lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, or otherwise repositioning objects.
* You’ll move around a lot — regularly sitting, climbing, balancing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, and crawling. You’ll go up and down stairs, ladders, scaffolding, ramps, and poles. And you’ll need to keep your balance when walking, standing, or crouching on narrow, slippery, or moving surfaces. (You’ll definitely get your steps in.)
* You must be able to safely operate a motor vehicle and make sure it and all other equipment is kept clean.
* The vision to perform detail-oriented activities at distances close to the eyes or within arm’s reach.
* Sometimes you’ll need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE), like an OSHA-compliant respirator, and you’ll need to be okay with regularly working in confined spaces, narrow aisles, or passageways (you know, where critters live).

**Work conditions**

Pests don’t always live in nice places — and that’s where we do our work. But don’t worry – we’ll prepare you with all you need to do the work as safely and as comfortably as possible.

* You’ll need to be able to work both inside and outside in your local climate in company-provided weather gear.
* You’ll sometimes be working around mechanical parts, vehicles, electrical current, heights and scaffolding, fumes, dust, and chemicals, and we’ll train you how to handle all of these conditions safely.
* This is kind of a no-brainer — you’ll be around animals and insects.
* And you’ll have to be okay with working in tight, confined spaces, narrow aisles, or passageways — like you might find in crawl spaces. We work where the critters live.

To join Terminix Nation, you’ll need to meet state and federal regulations and company safety requirements.

This position offers a base pay plus commission.

· $18.00 - $22.00 during training

In this role, you’ll have the opportunity to shape the educational journey of our diverse learners and make a tangible impact on their lives. Our Director will lead a talented and experienced team, train new hires, and manage a department that is a vital piece of our overall mission. Freudigman & Billings fosters a supportive environment where professional growth and advancement are not just encouraged but prioritized. Our community fosters strong relationships between students and their instructors, and our founders’ background in cognitive science makes Freudigman & Billings uniquely able to support our instructors with the personalized training they need to ensure that every student receives individualized attention.

 **What We Do**



Freudigman & Billings uses an efficacious approach to standardized test preparation that is influenced by the founders’ collective experience working in cognitive science at Yale University. Their method was formulated based on years of working within the public school system to help develop and research effective models for aligning student evaluation with school curriculum.

  

The Freudigman & Billings approach teaches critical thinking, applied reasoning, and problem solving strategies. We help students understand fundamental principles about how the world of information is organized and how they can interact with that information. This process does not involve the rote memorization of vocabulary or inundation of practice questions that many associate with “test prep.” Instead, we focus on teaching students effective strategies for gathering, sequencing, categorizing, and classifying information from text and visual sources. These processes contribute to a student’s ability to reason, solve problems, make inferences, and draw conclusions.

 **Who We Are**



Our staff is composed of educators from around the country whose collective experiences strengthen us as individuals and as an organization. Our fundamental belief at Freudigman & Billings is that children learn best in the context of supportive relationships and we work closely together to create and execute individualized learning plans. This means that you’ll continue to develop your instructional, relationship-building, and analytical skills in a way that will allow you to consider the whole child - their learning profile, personality, and environmental circumstances.

 **Who You Are**



Freudigman & Billings guides students through their entire high school trajectory. While 5+ years of experience in coaching for standardized exams is a must, you should also possess exceptional organizational skills and the desire to help students navigate the sometimes challenging and lengthy course of test preparation. You should have experience working with students who have diagnosed learning differences and accommodations on standardized testing, and understand the battery of testing that qualifies students for these accommodations. Preference will be given to candidates who have had experience managing team members at some point in their career. This is a great role for an individual who enjoys direct instruction but also seeks to utilize other skill sets to pursue career advancement opportunities.

 **Why Join Freudigman & Billings?**


**Predictable hours at a single office location**: Almost always, our work with students takes place at our 11,000 square foot headquarters in Westport, CT. Students are encouraged to utilize our space not only to see their instructors, but to do homework, hang out with friends, have a snack, get some advice, or even catch a quick nap during finals week. Instructors are provided with a private classroom, a whiteboard, and all materials necessary for a productive session. No unpaid time as you drive from house to house!


**Teamwork:** We work closely together on a daily basis to create and execute individualized learning plans, meaning that our work is far more comprehensive and impactful than a transactional hour of “tutoring.” We are proud of the collegiality that our building and our philosophy inspires, as well as the team of educators we have attracted as a result.


**Professional development:** We care about our staff and teaching you how to teach. Our team of Directors have PhDs, Masters degrees, and other certifications to help you achieve your goals and help you gain mastery of your own instructional techniques. You will learn our pedagogy and become part of this leadership team.


**Administrative support:** We have a full-time administrative team that handles scheduling, billing, inventory and printing of materials, and administration and scoring of practice exams.


**Great benefits:** Paid time off, paid holidays, and sick days. Medical, dental, and vision insurance, short and long term disability insurance, paid parental leave, and a 401k plan.


**Great pay:** $135,000 to $165,000 salary based on experience and desired tutoring caseload

 **What You’ll Do**


* Engage with potential and current clients to offer insightful explanations of our test prep program and guide them through what the F&B test prep process looks like
* Assist with client onboarding to ensure that families are well-informed about student plans and progress
