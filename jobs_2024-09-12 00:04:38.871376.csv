**Position Summary:** The Recreation Specialist is responsible for the overall management of the Recreation Department to meet the goals of the organization within its policies and procedures; develops and implements recreation programs appropriate to the client population and supportive of efforts to return clients to the community. He/she is responsible for expanding their project for the benefit of residents (i.e., assisting with responding to RFPs, grants, etc.).

**Nature and Scope:** The Recreation Specialist must plan, develop, and implement a broad range of educational, recreational, and cultural activities for children, for adults and for families as a whole. Some activities are one-time events, some are periodic, and some are on-going. The Recreation Specialist, therefore, must be innovative, flexible, extremely well organized, and sensitive to the changing needs of a population always in flux.


Because the clients served are all coping with crisis associated with domestic violence problems, they sometimes find it difficult to function cooperatively in large groups, and this presents a special challenge to workers. Furthermore, although the Recreation Specialist provides both children and adults with important opportunities for growth and development, parents who feel themselves to be in dire situations and suffused with helplessness may not readily see the value of the program, and staff must often work hard to help clients recognize its importance.


Finally, the Recreation Specialist, perhaps more than any other staff member, has the opportunity to interact with clients in informal settings. Thus, they have a unique opportunity to observe clients interacting as individuals and as families. The information gained from these interactions can be invaluable to the facilitys interdisciplinary approach. Just as important, the Workers have the opportunity to serve as role models. Sometimes it is in just such settings that staff can demonstrate to clients the efficiency of cooperative, positive interactions.

* Provide school-age children with tutorial and remedial assistance including homework assistance and library skills.

Douglaston Development, Levine Builders, and Clinton Management are a dynamic privately held group of companies with a unique owner-builder-manager advantage, known collectively as The Douglaston Companies.


The Douglaston Companies started with the founding of Levine Builders in 1979 with just two people. Standing by our core values of integrity and ethics for the past four decades the firm has grown to 200 employees. By providing general contracting and construction management services, Levine Builders has built, renovated and rehabilitated thousands of residential units and millions of square feet of commercial, hotel, office buildings, retail centers, religious, educational, and healthcare facilities.


With the later establishment of Douglaston Development as the driving engine of the organization, the two companies worked in unison to leverage each others expertise to develop and build most complex projects while also growing and thriving in challenging markets.

**About Us:**



Warby Parker was founded with a mission: to inspire and impact the world with vision, purpose, and style.



We're constantly asking ourselves how we can do more and make a greater impact, and that starts by reimagining everything that a company and industry can be. We want to demonstrate that a business can scale while doing good in the world, without charging a premium for it. And we've learned that it takes creativity, empathy, and innovation to achieve that goal.



Since the day we launched in 2010, we've pioneered ideas, designed products, and developed technologies that help people see. We offer everything you need for happier eyes at a price that leaves you with money in your pocket, from designer-quality glasses and contacts to eye exams and vision tests, and you can meet us online, at our stores, or even in your home. Wherever and whenever you need it, we're there to make exceptional vision care simple and accessible. (Delightful, too.)



Ultimately, we believe in vision for all, which is why for every pair of glasses or sunglasses we sell, a pair of glasses is distributed to someone in need through our Buy a Pair, Give a Pair program.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Warby-Parker","http://www.warbyparker.com","New York","501 to 1,000","","Marby Parker was founded with a rebellious spirit and a lofty objective: to offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price, while leading the way for socially conscious businesses.","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/56f2123c26a1b1e8687851d8f0ef08d2","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_headerimage/1960x400/49ea419eaf79e3492df75cdfc33ccee7","Neil Blumenthal",""
