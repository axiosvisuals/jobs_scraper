The Fund for Public Health in New York City (FPHNYC) is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that is dedicated to the advancement of the health and well-being of all New Yorkers. To this end, in partnership with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), FPHNYC incubates innovative public health initiatives implemented by DOHMH to advance community health throughout the city. It facilitates partnerships, often new and unconventional, between government and the private sector to develop, test, and launch new initiatives. These collaborations speed the execution of demonstration projects, effect expansion of successful pilot programs, and support rapid implementation to meet the public health needs of individuals, families, and communities across New York City.
  
  

PROGRAM OVERVIEW
  
New York City Teens Connection (NYCTC) is an adolescent sexual health program of the Bureau of Maternal, Infant, and Reproductive Health (BMIRH) in the Division of Family and Child Health within the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). NYCTC is an expansion of Bronx Teens Connection, scaling up this successful community-based model to reach more youth throughout NYC. By engaging youth, parents, community-based organizations, schools, clinics, and citywide agencies in a comprehensive effort to improve adolescent sexual health, NYCTC will help youth in NYC learn about their sexual and reproductive health, access the information and resources they need to make healthy decisions and feel empowered to act on these decisions. Poor health outcomes rarely occur in isolation, and specific communities face multiple health inequities. These unfair, unnecessary, and avoidable disparities are rooted in historical and contemporary injustices and discrimination – including racism – and require the investment of attention, resources, and deliberate corrective efforts to repair. As part of BMIRH, NYCTC strives to apply a sexual and reproductive justice and racial framework that prioritizes individual choice and bodily autonomy within the contexts of historical events, lived experiences, sexualities, and social conditions and ensures we fully engage community partners to move this work forward. NYCTC is also part of a more significant health department effort to advance just and fair outcomes for all New Yorkers, particularly those most marginalized. It prioritizes neighborhoods with histories of social disinvestment and persistently poor health outcomes.
  
NYCTC works through partnerships and existing systems to bring evidence-based sexual health education programs and clinic linkages to young people ages 11-20 across several priority neighborhoods with histories of social and economic disinvestment. NYCTC reaches young people with sexual health education across six settings. Reducing the Risk, recommended by the NYC Department of Education (DOE), will be delivered in traditional high schools; Teen Health Project will be delivered in transfer and international high schools and select youth-serving organizations; Making Proud Choices will be delivered in middle schools; Positive Prevention Plus for Special Populations will be delivered in District 75 schools; Seventeen Days and Plan A will reach youth in clinics, schools, and youth-serving organizations, including foster care agencies and juvenile justice programs; and Sexual Health and Adolescent Risk Prevention reach youth in a variety of youth-serving organizations. All partnering schools and youth-serving organizations will also be linked to local “teen-friendly” clinics that provide high-quality sexual and reproductive health services to young people; instructors will incorporate a visit to the linked clinic within each evidence-based program. The Linking Families and Teens curriculum will reach adolescents' parents through partnerships with school-based Parent Coordinators and various parent groups. Parent groups will receive education and support to improve their communication with youth about sexual and reproductive health. Building on relationships between DOHMH and community organizations, local leaders, and other stakeholders, NYCTC has established local Community Advisory Teams and Youth Leadership Teams in 3 boroughs that inform the program work, encourage systems-based changes, and help disseminate information throughout the priority communities. Lastly, an evaluation plan that regularly monitors key processes and outcome measures for each component will provide the basis for continual improvements.

**Life at Abridge**

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

**Diversity & Inclusion**
-------------------------


Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

**Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud**

We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process.

Axiom is where legal teams go to find the right talent for everything from routine in-house tasks to complex outside counsel work. Too many legal departments are stuck having to choose between paying the high fees of their law firm, hiring full-time employees they don't need, or turning to a low-cost agency that can't meet their quality standards. At the same time, top lawyers want to work on challenging legal matters, but they want more control over how, when, and where they practice. Both are forced compromises that no one should have to make. Axiom shares and meets the higher standards of its clients and lawyers, with our ""work smarter, adapt faster, go further"" approach – connecting growing mid-market and Fortune 500 companies with the world's deepest bench of experienced, specialized legal talent.

**Reports to the Director of Food & Beverage: Full-Time, Exempt**

**WHO WE ARE**
Hotels done differently. It’s not just a slogan or catchphrase, it is who we are in everything we do. We believe in the power of People, Place and Character; ensuring our properties are a place where individuals are valued and celebrated as a tribute to the neighborhoods and the people of the communities in which we operate; elevating our associates’ pride in who they are, where they live and who we serve.
The MC Hotel is part of Marriott’s Autograph Collection, bringing an authentic experience to the heart of Montclair, New Jersey for the first time in decades. The 159 room, ground-up development opened in 2019. Complete with restaurant, rooftop bar featuring unparalleled views of Manhattan, and curated lobby market, The MC Hotel serves as a central hub for visitors and residents of Montclair, a city known for the arts and creativity.
Since its founding, Aparium has grown into a new kind of hotel brand, one that ventures off the beaten path, both geographically and philosophically. It is a sophisticated hotel brand known for its singular ability to combine the business acumen of large hospitality companies with the charm of boutique hotels, bringing the disparate forces together in bustling, smaller markets.
**WHO YOU ARE**
You are excited and passionate about being a leader of the three-ring circus that is Food + Beverage. You pride yourself in controlling chaos and are adept at making each guest in the restaurant or bar feel like they are the only person in the room. While your mission is to provide an unmatched experience for your guests; you value the work and feedback of your associates as well. You enjoy and excel in the fast-paced and often high-pressure environment to execute what is needed in exceeding our guests' expectations and demonstrating the Aparium difference. You are attentive, courteous, efficient, and motivate others by inspiring confidence, respect, enthusiasm, and collaboration. You are highly organized and can work in an often unpredictable environment to meet deadlines, all while maintaining a positive and professional demeanor.
**THE ROLE**
The Food + Beverage Manager reports directly to the Director of Food + Beverage. It is critical the person in this position is tactical and strategic; if you only prefer to “see the forest” and not “plant the trees,” then this is not a role for you. All leaders of Aparium are required to get their hands dirty to unearth existing needs and personally ensure what needs to be fixed is taken care of.

The Food + Beverage Manager will assist in leading the F+B team to execute the designated service periods in the Food + Beverage outlets. The Food + Beverage Manager wears many different hats throughout the day - leading by example while spending much of the day engaging with their associates and guests before, during, and after services. We encourage our leaders to inspire and challenge each other to be their best. A large degree of self-motivation is needed to drive the department, while collaborating with the Culinary team to execute the restaurant concept at a high level. As a leader within Aparium Hotel Group, the Food + Beverage Supervisor will work with a phenomenal group of peers who will insist that they are collaborative, humble, experienced, and open-minded – no egos are allowed. The Food + Beverage Manager will maintain and execute the standards of service for the outlets, assuring success for the guest experience.
**WHAT YOU WILL DO**
* Uphold and model the company’s principles of People, Place and Character; and ensure your team also models our values to drive collaboration, intuition and translocal hospitality
* Actively participate in the recruitment, training, scheduling, supervising, coaching, and motivating of all Food + Beverage associates in order to create an environment that nurtures ideas and develops future talent for succession planning in the F+B program, effectively using corrective action to address root causes of issues, course-correcting any missed opportunities
* Ensure timely set-up of the outlet(s) and adhere to F+B standards and guest requests through active communication with the F+B department
* Be responsible for maintaining a strong guest and VIP relationship and ensuring all requests are communicated to staff
* Review all reservations and cover count reports to determine appropriate staffing levels and station assignments
* Work with the F+B and Culinary teams to effectively communicate all requests
* Manage inventory, control breakage/loss reduction of china, glass and silver related to restaurant services
* Assists in other F+B departments as needed
* Maintain regular communication with the F+B Management to provide updates, discuss plans, communicate needs, and align on priorities, understanding that flexibility with your responsibilities is paramount to support a successful operation

**HOW YOU WILL LEAD**
* Offer direct support for your team through coaching, counseling, gentle correction, and constructive feedback
* Collaborate effectively with all hotel departments including Sales, Culinary, Food + Beverage, and Hotel Operations to provide an exemplary guest experience
* Be respectful in your daily interactions with your managers, direct reports, and peers, exemplifying the utmost level of professionalism and being a pillar within your community

Warby Parker was founded with a mission: to inspire and impact the world with vision, purpose, and style.



We're constantly asking ourselves how we can do more and make a greater impact, and that starts by reimagining everything that a company and industry can be. We want to demonstrate that a business can scale while doing good in the world, without charging a premium for it.

Since the day we launched in 2010, we've pioneered ideas, designed products, and developed technologies that help people see. We offer everything you need for happier eyes at a price that leaves you with money in your pocket, from designer-quality glasses and contacts to eye exams and vision tests, and you can meet us online, at our stores, or even in your home. Wherever and whenever you need it, we're there to make exceptional vision care simple and accessible. (Delightful, too.)



Ultimately, we believe in vision for all, which is why for every pair of glasses or sunglasses we sell, a pair of glasses is distributed to someone in need through our Buy a Pair, Give a Pair program.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Warby-Parker","http://www.warbyparker.com","New York","501 to 1,000","","Marby Parker was founded with a rebellious spirit and a lofty objective: to offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price, while leading the way for socially conscious businesses.","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/56f2123c26a1b1e8687851d8f0ef08d2","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_headerimage/1960x400/49ea419eaf79e3492df75cdfc33ccee7","Neil Blumenthal",""

Our job is to demonstrate how Google's products solve the world's problems-from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can-changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.

We would prefer to hire someone who has worked in a HOTEL before or perhaps managed an Apartment Complex, but this is not required.

For this job, YOU must be qualified to actually do hands-on repair work and maintenance work. This includes all of the normal kinds of BUILDING MAINTENANCE, but, as a hotel – we are especially concerned about image and how things look. You would need to see that our guest rooms, our furniture - equipment, public areas, and the building exteriors are well cared for, in the same way they would be if you were working in a well-kept residential house.

For this job, we are looking for someone who is organized, and QUALITY-conscious, AND who has an ***eye for detail.*** 

You would work directly for the general manager of the hotel. In addition, you must be able to work IN FULL COOPERATION WITH the hotel’s Housekeeping staff and the Front Desk staff.

Please keep in mind that this work schedule will include WEEKENDS AND HOLIDAYS, since we are open, of course, every day of the year. In a hotel, unexpected last-minute repairs are often needed on Fridays, Saturdays and holidays, when we are the busiest. Although we can tell you this does not happen often, it is a part of the job.

When you work, you must work neatly, and be able to switch from one project to another, if necessary. For instance, it can happen that you are in the middle of repair – and THEN SOMETHING IMPORTANT must be done in order to get ANOTHER room ready for a guest who is just about to check in. This means that flexibility is very necessary in our type of business.

Our PRIME concern ALWAYS is the comfort and the satisfaction of our hotel guests.

**About** Spate


At Spate, we use data science to predict the next big consumer trend in beauty, personal care & food.


Spate was founded in 2018 by Yarden Horwitz & Olivier Zimmer, two ex-Googlers who led the trendspotting division at Google and uncovered trends such as turmeric, cold brew, and face masks. Spate has been funded by the prestigious Y Combinator incubator and Initialized Capital. We currently have ~180 clients in the U.S., mainly in the beauty space from direct-to-consumer brands to big names such as L’Oréal, Estée Lauder, Unilever.

  

As two ex-Googlers with a passion for using data to spot new patterns in consumer behavior, and we have made it our mission to build the world’s greatest consumer trends prediction platform of all time. And not just because we want to be trendy, but because we want to help brands get better at giving consumers what they really want.


Brands waste over $200BN every year due to product launch failures and inventory waste. By spotting Turmeric, we were able to tell brands to stop wasting money on kale products and provide consumers with glorious golden milk lattes instead - because that’s what consumers want.


How do we do this? We tap into publicly available consumer data (anonymous and aggregated) to identify interesting shifts in consumer behavior. We leverage the latest available technology in ML to solve problems in ways that have never been explored before.

**Why Spate?**

* Join a well-funded company that is working with the top brands in consumer goods
* Work directly with the founders to set the direction of the company
* Grow in a fast-paced environment
* Always be up-to-date on the latest trends!

We enjoy a casual atmosphere, but our culture is about getting things done. We are passionate yet pragmatic when it comes to solving problems in a fast-paced environment. Our standards are high, but we thrive on working with people we respect and can learn from. We’re flexible on work styles, as long as everyone is getting their work done - and getting it done well.


We are an equal opportunity employer where our diversity and inclusion are central pillars of our company strategy. We look for applicants who understand, embrace, and thrive in a multicultural and increasingly globalized world. We do not discriminate based on race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.


We're excited to find a Sales Development Representative who is passionate about working in a fast pace environment, sales, and consumer trends that is ready to make a meaningful impact at Spate. If you meet the criteria above, please apply to join our team and help shape the future of our company.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Spate","","","","","","","","",""

Everything we do is driven by our belief that every kid is a math kid.


Our top-rated learning platform is designed to catch kids up and move them forward in grade level math. And it works. Large-scale efficacy research shows students who use Zearn make significant gains in math proficiency, including the students who start multiple grade levels behind.


The vital importance of learning math today is hard to understate, and yet today, it is common to think that only some are born to achieve in math. Math learning is often disparaged and feared (e.g. I’d rather go to the dentist than do algebra) or viewed as a special interest of luxury (e.g. if kids don’t have a passion for math that is okay, maybe they have a passion for pottery). We don’t look at learning to read the same way.


Zearn exists to help create a world where all children love learning math.


As a nonprofit, all of our work is driven by what is best for kids. At the same time, we operate as an intense and fast-moving technology company, inclusively solving hard problems that will impact current and future generations. The problems we solve require expertise in pedagogy, software development, persuasion, psychology, design, writing, video production, problem solving, and countless other disciplines. As an organization that is always stretching to get to the next level of impact, every single person owns mission critical work.


If you are ready to join our team of problem solvers, own work that will drive us to achieve impact at scale, we are looking for you.
