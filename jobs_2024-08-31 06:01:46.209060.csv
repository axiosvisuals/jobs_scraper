The broader electronic team is comprised of experts with a particular focus on algorithms and analytics, data analysis and content, electronic sales-trading, EMS integration.


While our client coverage personnel primarily manage client relationships, this product role is expected to be client facing - speaking and presenting directly to “low touch” institutional clients as and when needed, marketing the product, and solving client issues. While global futures are a major component, note that the role spans listed derivatives more broadly, including all non-US equity options and global options on futures.


If you are interested in a role that uses your product expertise to help conceptualise thought process and design and optimize algorithm performance and design, then this role will be if interest. You will be expected to proactively follow market, industry, and client trends in your field of expertise, and adapt these for application on Citi’s products and solutions platforms.

**What you will do will be varied day to day, but the key drivers for the role are**:

* Algorithm design and optimizing algorithmic performance.
* Transaction Cost Analysis, for reviewing algo performance and using this to drive the product roadmap as well as client facing analytics.
* Managing both internal technology teams and vendors to ensure a timely and effective delivery of projects and initiatives.
* Internal education for new product launches –the global electronic team, high touch sales-traders, house traders, and external client marketing
* Working with clients on short term quantitative analysis and projects
* Management of our control’s environment – working with compliance and Electronic Trading risk managers to design appropriate controls that protect the firm but do not hinder genuine trading objectives.
* Internal advocate for electronic trading across multiple asset classes – working on joint projects with Cash Equities, Rates, FX, and Commodities
* Tracking success of the product and helping to influence our strategic direction.

**What we will need from you:**


This role requires a hands-on person who has a broad set of skills –both generalist knowledge and specialist. To be successful, the candidate must join the dots across multiple projects and business areas and have the credibility to drive and enthuse the team around them. Key attributes that will drive our selection include:

* Experience in listed derivatives markets – not necessarily direct trading experience (although that is helpful), but crucially, an understanding of market structure and microstructure, and the nuances of derivatives.
* Experience with algorithmic execution, Trading Analytics (TCA) and exchanges, OMS/EMS vendors, FIX protocol.
* Basic analytical and maths skills – ideally familiar with python charting and analytics libraries, drawing insights from data via traditional and ML techniques.
* Data architecture and coding best practices – there is no software development in this role, but the candidate would deal with software developers and can challenge poor design decisions.
* Ability to review complex systems and risk platforms, and spot where there could be technical issues; edge cases with algo behaviour, or gaps in protective controls.
* Confidence in talking to clients to market our offering, with fluent domain expertise.
* Confidence in talking with compliance and senior risk managers in the firm about our platform, controls, and suitability.
* Understanding of regulation in different jurisdictions and how to adhere to regulatory rules and internal policies.
