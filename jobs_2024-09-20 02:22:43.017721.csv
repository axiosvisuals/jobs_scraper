Dr. Robert A. Ellis, Jr. was born in 1927. He received his bachelor’s degree in 1948 from Fisk University - a highly ranked historically black university, and received his master’s degree in physics from Yale University in 1949. After receiving his master’s degree, Dr. Ellis taught at Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial (A&I), later known as Tennessee State University – a historically black land-grant public university. He then went to earn his doctorate at the University of Iowa. In 1956, Dr. Ellis joined Project Matterhorn - a small group headed by Lyman Spitzer Jr. at Princeton University working on controlled fusion. Project Matterhorn would later become the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL). Dr. Ellis became a key member of the team studying the magnetic confinement and heating of plasma in stellarators and in 1988 he was appointed head of experimental projects at PPPL.

  

During his later years, he devoted much of his time to furthering international collaboration in science. He served as foreign secretary of the Advisory Committee on the USSR and Eastern Europe of the National Academy of Science, a member of the Science Advisory Committee for the NASA Research Laboratories, and head of the physics section of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. In 1984, he became the U.S. representative to the Commission on Plasma Physics of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics.

  

Dr. Ellis was a pioneer in modern experimental plasma physics until his death on December 15, 1989. To his colleagues he is best known for his ability to come up with relevant information on almost any topic, and above all, his flashing wit. He also had a deep and gentle understanding of people-their hopes and ambitions, their motivations and frustrations.

  

From NSBP honors (February 2020) and Physics Today (March 1991)

==============================

*First, an important note: Data shows that men on average apply for a role if they meet 3/10 requirements while women often only do so if it’s closer to 10/10. We work hard to be clear and specific about what our roles include and demand and encourage you to apply if you see a strong (but not necessarily perfect) fit between you and the opportunity.*

**The Role**


In FutureFit AI's dynamic landscape of AI and workforce development, the role of **Proposals and Communications Manager** is pivotal in driving our growth.


Your role will be twofold: First, at the helm of our proposal strategy, you will drive the entire lifecycle of our response to strategic funding opportunities, from identifying prospects and managing partners to ultimately ***developing winning proposals***. Second, through management of brand and marketing efforts and creation of compelling marketing content, you will be essential in ***growing our brand in the market***. Beyond these core pillars of your role, you will be an active contributor to wider go-to-market initiatives, applying your unique perspective to make a meaningful impact across the organization.


Reporting to our Head of Partnerships, you will be responsible for:

* **Strategic Proposal Development** – Leading the full proposal development lifecycle, including opportunity research, writing, gathering cross-functional input, editing, and on-time submission, ultimately delivering winning proposals that reflect FutureFit AI's transformative impact in AI-driven workforce development.
* **Stakeholder Outreach and Engagement** – Proactive outreach and engagement with potential funding sources and partners as well as internal team collaboration, fostering a collaborative approach that enhances proposal quality and impact.
* **Strategic Brand Content** – Drive FutureFit AI’s brand presence by developing and executing a content strategy that spans our website, newsletters, social media, and other external channels. You’ll be the voice behind much of our brand communication, positioning FutureFit AI as a thought leader in the future of work and AI-powered career development.
* **Collaborative Storytelling** – Work closely with the Growth, Product, and Customer Success teams to craft content that showcases our impact and addresses customer needs. In addition to incorporating these perspectives into proposals, you'll be responsible for creating case studies, thought leadership articles, and customer success stories.
* **Content Calendar Management** – Own the content calendar, ensuring consistent delivery of high-quality content that supports our marketing and brand-building initiatives. Plan, write, and optimize content for engagement, conversion, and brand consistency.
* **Market Research** – In addition to proactively searching for and identifying new funding opportunities, you will conduct research on industry trends, customer pain points, and competitor strategies to inform both proposals and content creation. Your research will play a key role in how we position our value proposition across all channels.

**Your Experience**

* Recommended 4+ years of experience in fast-paced, highly strategic, outcomes-oriented environments.
* Direct experience in proposal writing is a significant advantage.
* While the skills you have developed are more important than where you developed them, we believe there will be strong benefits to backgrounds that include experiences such as: high-growth early-stage startups, B2B SaaS companies, management consulting firms, workforce development organizations, and philanthropic or foundation entities.
* We’re looking for a blend of strategic vision, exceptional project management, and compelling communication skills. We welcome diverse experiences that demonstrate your ability to lead, strategize, and communicate for impact.

**Your Skills**

* **Content Creation and Comms Master** – You’re a dynamic content creator who knows how to adapt your tone and messaging across different platforms and formats to achieve your objectives. Whether it’s a social media update, newsletter, or - of course - a formal proposal, you know how to engage an audience and drive meaningful action. You take a meticulous approach to content creation, with a focus on exceptional quality and impact.
* **Cross-Functional Collaborator** – Skilled at working cross-functionally with teams like Product, Growth, and Customer Success to align proposals and content with organizational goals and create messaging that resonates with clients' needs.
* **Proposal Writing Experience:** While not required, you will benefit from having written high-quality, persuasive proposals in response to RFPs. You are skilled at weaving together technical details, company vision, and client needs into cohesive, winning documents. Experience with government proposals or workforce development is a bonus.
* **Adaptable Project Manager:** Excellent organizational and time management skills, with the ability to manage multiple, simultaneous projects and hold all contributors accountable to ensure that all proposals and content meet deadlines and quality standards.
* **Deadline-Driven Efficiency:** Ability to complete tasks in a fast-paced, deadline-driven environment, maintaining focus and quality under pressure.
* **Research and Storytelling:** Effective and experienced researcher who can absorb complex information, understand market trends, and turn insights into compelling narratives that resonate with our customers and partners.
* **Crafty Digital Creator** – Beyond your writing skills, you're comfortable creating compelling short-form digital content (videos, gifs, memes, etc.) to quickly uplevel lightweight communications like emails and LinkedIn posts.




**Your Education**


Your alma mater isn’t our focus. Your skills, hunger, and drive are. If you’re someone who learns continuously, tackles challenges head-on, and knows your strengths and gaps intimately, you’re our person.

**Job benefits**

* Unlimited PTO

Founded in June 2023, Crete Professionals Alliance (Crete PA) aims to drive growth across accounting and professional service firms in the United States.

With over ten partner firms, several deals under LOI, and substantial committed capital, Crete PA is poised to shortly become equivalent to a top 40 firm in terms of aggregate revenue, with ambitions to expand into a multi-country platform. Supported by ZBS Partners, a firm managing over $500 million in assets, and led by cofounders experienced in developing multi-industry platforms, Crete PA partners with local firms to enhance their independence while boosting their revenue and profitability.
