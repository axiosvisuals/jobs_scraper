**The filling of this position is based upon continued funding in the Board of Education budget.**  

  

**Note: Teachers dually certified in TESOL, Bilingual Education or ESL, with experience in Sheltered Instruction or fluency in a language other than English, will be given preference for all Stamford Public School positions.**  

  

**General Statement:**  

The Connecticut State Board of Education (CSBE) believes that high-quality, comprehensive and effective English as a Second Language (ESL) and bilingual education programs are essential to acquire English language proficiency and academic proficiency for students who are English Learners (ELs). EL Teachers work under Section 10-17e(3) of the C.G.S. This statute defines an ESL program as ""a program that uses only English as the instructional language for eligible students and enables such students to achieve English proficiency and academic mastery of subject matter content and higher order skills, including critical thinking, so as to meet appropriate grade promotion and graduation requirements.""  

  

Bilingual New Arrivals is a program option for students in grades one through twelve who have been in the U.S. for one year or less, come from a Spanish language background, and are identified as a Student with Limited or Interrupted Formal Education (SLIFE). Students attend the program from a minimum of ten weeks to a maximum of one year, with the possibility to apply for a 10 month extension. Using TESOL methodologies, and taught in English, the program provides students with an intensive English language course of study in addition to following the content-area curriculum with support provided in Spanish.

**What is cultural responsiveness? Cultural responsiveness involves understanding and appropriately responding to the unique combination of cultural variables and the full range of dimensions of diversity that the professional and client/patient/family bring to interactions. Clinical approaches—such as interview style, assessment tools, and therapeutic techniques—that are appropriate for one individual may not be appropriate for another. It is important to recognize that the unique influence of an individual's cultural and linguistic background may change over time and according to circumstance, necessitating adjustments in clinical approaches.**

**​We strive to reduce the historical disparities that exist in special education- in particular, the over-identification of historically marginalized groups, which include bilingual and bicultural students.**

**How do we achieve this? Our team consists of speech-language pathologists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, psychologists, special educators, and social workers that specialize in providing culturally and linguistically responsive assessments and services- using the latest evidence-based practice, extensive case-history review, parent and teacher interviews, observations and work-samples, dynamic assessment measures, non-standard administration of standardized assessments, and clinical judgement.**

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada.

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington).

**Job Title:** Bookkeeper

**Reports to:** CFO

**Location:** New York, NY (11106)


Kommissary is a social enterprise on a mission to spread joy through food. We produce and deliver high volumes of meals spanning a diverse array of cuisines to every demographic in New York City. We are a proud minority owned business that celebrates diversity, equity, and inclusion.


We are a rapidly growing organization and need a bookkeeper to support our financial analyst, COO, tax accountant, and Purchasing Director in properly recording purchase orders, accounts payables, bills of ladings, accounts receivables, and all related data. You will be responsible to create financial reports to give insight to the performance of each division and associated KPI. You'll also coordinate with leaders in the kitchen team to collect data related to our menus and recipies.


The ideal candidate is relentlessly detail oriented, with a knack for remembering numbers. You will be a numbers detective who will obsessively investigate any inconsistencies that arise. The role is fully-in office because much of this investigation requires a lot of phone calls, in-person follow-ups, and fact-checking. And you will record all your findings accurately in Fishbowl Inventory (our warehouse management software), Quickbooks Online, and some spreadsheets.


Note that there are required screening questions. If you apply and don't answer them, you will be immediately rejected.


What success in this role looks like:

**Onboarding Period:**


You will begin by familiarizing yourself with the team members you'll work with most as well as go through training for Fishbowl Inventory. You won’t need training for QBO since you'll have that experience already. As such, you’ll dive right into day-today QBO entry and reconciliations in your first week. There will be a fair amount of data entry tasks, but you will get the support of some remote data-entry freelancers. You'll be expected to accomplish these tasks with impeccable accuracy, and your supervisor will check your work to verify your accuracy.

**1st Month Goals:**


You'll have developed a reputation of making few to no mistakes with your data entry and reconciliation work. You’ll also generate your first monthly Balance Sheet, P&L, and Cash Flow statements for the finance team. You’ll have seen one complete monthly cycle of recording and reporting. You’ll understand the big picture and know what you need to improve on in the next two months.

**3rd Month Goals:**


You'll be comfortable in our WMS system and QBO reconciliation processes and have your in-person investigations down to a routine. You will know how to keep the data clean and consistent so that when you help our financial analyst build reports, the data is reflective of what’s really happening. This responsibility is critically important for our management team.

**1st Year Goals:**


After your first year, everyone on the team will know that you're the master of all things data and accounting. You know all the numbers and the story behind them because you wrote those stories as you tracked everything throughout the year. Every issue you encountered was a forensic adventure that you conquered. And you take a lot of pride and joy in making sure every figure is categorized in the correct buckets.

**Future Growth:**


As your skill sets outgrow the role, you can become a financial controller/analyst and eventually manage the next data manager and bookkeeper. You'll go from recording the data to developing reports, and eventually helping with the decisions and creating strategic action plans from those reports.

**Physical Demands:** Generally, presents standard office environment. Must be able to remain in a stationary position >95% of the time. Continually operates a computer, keyboard and mouse, and other office productivity machinery, such as a calculator copy machine, printer, and mobile Smartphone device. Constantly positions self to comfortably maintain computer equipment. May occasionally be required to move about in an office setting or position office equipment weighing between 10-25 pounds.
