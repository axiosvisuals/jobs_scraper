For those of you who feel safe in your current employment, are reluctant for change, and deem it impossible to find happiness and success in a new environment and professional position, I quote the words of Muhammad Ali who boldly stated a half century ago**, ""Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men who find it easier to live in the world they've been given than to explore the power they have to change it. Impossible is not a fact, it's an opinion. Impossible is not a declaration, it's a dare. Impossible is potential. Impossible is temporary. Impossible is nothing!**
