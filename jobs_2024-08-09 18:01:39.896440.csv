Are you looking for a job where you can use your experience to propel your career into management? At New York Life, we will invest in you from the start to help you learn and grow as a financial professional first. We’ll train you in valuable skills, such as marketing, business development, and customer relationship management, and provide you with the tools you need to further your career. Then we’ll train you and provide you with access to the tools you need for a career in management.

**What we’re looking for**

We’re looking for people who want to make a lasting impact on the financial well-being of individuals, families, and small businesses—motivated people who can answer yes to one of the following questions:

* Do you have sales or managerial experience in another industry?
* Have you previously run your own business?
* Do you have an MBA or other equivalent degree?

In the Accelerated Path to Management Program, you’ll start off as a financial professional, learning how to sell our products, building client relationships, and meeting specific requirements1 before transitioning into a management role.

You’ll then undergo a six-month intensive training program designed to prime you for success as a manager. You will use that experience to understand how to recruit and coach others to success.

**What we offer**

**Your first year**

You’ll learn firsthand about a financial professional’s role and day-to-day work by working as a financial professional for the first year of your career journey with New York Life. We will provide you with complete training, access to digital tools, and a comprehensive product suite.

**Training and resources**

You will receive top-notch training that will give you an understanding and appreciation for the strength and value of New York Life. Beyond this training and support, New York Life will provide access to the resources you need to succeed day-to-day, including experts on hand to answer your questions and a suite of digital sales, prospecting and marketing tools that will help you attract and retain your clients with web, social and email content.

**Product Solutions**

You will learn about our robust products and services that can help clients achieve their financial goals. Together with its subsidiaries, New York Life provides a range of competitive insurance and financial products, including life insurance, annuities, long-term care insurance, disability income insurance, and investment products such as mutual funds through our broker-dealer, NYLIFE Securities LLC (member of FINRA and SIPC), a Licensed Insurance Agency. You will be required to hold securities licenses and FINRA registrations and affiliate with NYLIFE Securities as a registered representative before you can offer investment products.

**Your transition to a Field Manager role**

After meeting specific requirements for the first 12 months as a financial professional, you will enter a specialized six-month Associate Partner training program.1 We’ll help you to lead and build your team of financial professionals. Throughout your career journey with New York Life, you’ll continue to have opportunities to grow and be promoted to increasingly senior levels of management.

**How we will compensate you**

When you begin with New York Life as a financial professional2, you will receive income that is commission-based.3

If you meet the requirements and approvals to become an Associate Partner, you will receive a salary. The salary range for an Associate Partner is $60,000–$150,000 (in California and Washington, the minimum salary is $64,480 and $65,479, respectively), plus you will be eligible for certain bonuses and other incentives based on the performance of agents in your unit, including additional compensation related to the agents you recruit and develop (“R&Ds”). R&Ds are additional compensation that is designed to increase your income and to reimburse for any reasonable and necessary expenses we do not otherwise reimburse. You will also be eligible for medical, dental, and vision benefits, life, long-term disability, and accidental death and dismemberment coverages, a pension plan,4 and a 401(k) savings plan.5

New York Life will value and reward your hard work and success. You’ll have significant income potential over time, because our field managers’ compensation is directly aligned with their recruiting performance and the production level of their team of financial professionals. The average income among our 579 recruiters at all levels in 2022 was $240,000.6

Intrigued?**   
\\*\\*  
\\*\\*  
Busting bugs has its benefits. Company-provided truck, gas, and phone. Benefits including a 401(k) with a company match. But it’s more than that. It’s serving with a smile. It’s having your teammates’ backs. It’s going above and beyond and making a difference. We step in and step up when people have problems they can’t fix, and they need the pros. We crush their pest problems and lift their spirits.

Back to you. Are you a hard worker? Can you follow direction, adapt to change, and solve problems? Are you organized, friendly, and motivated to succeed? That’s a great place to start.

**As a Pest Control Technician, here’s what you can expect** 

* You won’t be tied to a desk. You’ll be out and about — mobile, independent, and growing your career with a clear view of next steps. You’ll be the face of Terminix to your local community (with the backing of a national brand), and your clients will count on you to protect their businesses, their homes, and their families.
* When you first join Terminix Nation, you’ll spend a few months in training. Once you’ve got that and some state required licenses and certificates under your belt, you’ll take the lead with your own customers.
* You’ll get rewarded with competitive pay and robust benefits to cover you and your family. As a teammate, you will be eligible for a 401(k) with company match, company-paid life insurance, tuition reimbursement, and a generous student loan repayment program. You put in the work, and you’ll reap the rewards.
* You’ll be part of a community — bonus points if you’re already a leader in yours. Our bonds are strong at Terminix Nation and the relationships we develop in the communities we serve are unparalleled. Our teammates give back through volunteering, donations, scholarships, and more.
* You’ll be onboarded and trained by the best of ‘em. You’ll get paid to get licensed, something you’ll have for a lifetime. You’ll know how to bust bugs at home, too.

**What your days will look like**

* Roll up your sleeves and get ready to learn how we take care of customers. You’ll become an expert in applying our company products so they’re safe and effective.
* Are you a good driver? As a technician, your office is the cab of your Terminix truck. You’ll use it on calls and take it home, too. Same goes for your Terminix phone. We trust our technicians.
* You’ll be responsible for building relationships with customers, scheduling and confirming their appointments, helping with sales to current customers, and expanding our product to new customers.
* Does technology scare you? That’s okay. We provide training and support to ensure you’re comfortable using state-of-the-art tools. You’ll also need to have strong communication skills so that you can email, text, call, talk, and write effectively. Oh, and sometimes there’s paperwork.
* There’s an opportunity to grow into a role you’re passionate about and fits your skillset — whether that’s management, a move to sales, or another opportunity at Terminix.

**Some non-negotiables**  
There are some things you’ll just need to have or know to join Terminix Nation as a Pest Control Technician.

* High school diploma or GED; or one to three months related experience and/or training; or equivalent combination of education and experience.
* Solid reading, writing, and verbal communication skills and the ability to present information in both internal and external settings.
* Some basic math skills — add, subtract, multiply, and divide in all units of measure, using whole numbers, common fractions, and decimals. You’ll need to be able to follow instructions for mixing on product labels.
* With the help of Terminix (and with the company footing the bill), you’ll need to maintain the licenses/certificates as required by federal, state, and/or local regulations.
* Valid driver’s license in current state of residence.

**Straight talk about the physical demands of our work**

We’re not going to sugarcoat it. The essential functions of this job have some physical demands (of course, reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the essential functions.) Here’s what we mean:

* You’ve got to be able to move up to 10 lbs. regularly and 11–20 lbs. frequently, whether that’s lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, or otherwise repositioning objects.
* You’ll move around a lot — regularly sitting, climbing, balancing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, and crawling. You’ll go up and down stairs, ladders, scaffolding, ramps, and poles. And you’ll need to keep your balance when walking, standing, or crouching on narrow, slippery, or moving surfaces. (You’ll definitely get your steps in.)
* You must be able to safely operate a motor vehicle and make sure it and all other equipment is kept clean.
* The vision to perform detail-oriented activities at distances close to the eyes or within arm’s reach.
* Sometimes you’ll need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE), like an OSHA-compliant respirator.

**Work conditions**  
Pests don’t always live in nice places — and that’s where we do our work. But don’t worry – we’ll prepare you with all you need to do the work as safely and as comfortably as possible.

* You’ll need to be able to work both inside and outside in your local climate in company-provided weather gear.
* You’ll sometimes be working around mechanical parts, vehicles, electrical current, heights and scaffolding, fumes, dust, and chemicals, and we’ll train you how to handle all of these conditions safely.
* This is kind of a no-brainer — you’ll be around animals and insects.
* And you’ll have to be okay with working in tight, confined spaces, narrow aisles, or passageways — like you might find in crawl spaces. We work where the critters live.

To join Terminix Nation, you’ll need to meet state and federal regulations and company safety requirements.

Michael White, the renowned chef, restaurateur and innovator who helped define Manhattan’s modern Italian restaurant scene with destinations like Marea, Ai Fiori, and Osteria Morini, makes his return to New York with the October opening of Santi, from his BBianco Hospitality Group. Situated in the heart of midtown at Tishman Speyer’s 520 Madison Avenue, Santi will explore seasonal Italian cooking through the lens of White’s many years living in Italy and the South of France, offering both a culinary retrospective and an exciting next step in his storied career.

The name Santi is derived from a fond memory of White’s culinary mentor, Gianluigi Morini, a chef and bon vivant who helmed the kitchen at San Domenico. Eager to taste the dishes from the kitchen, he would wave off a plate and utensils and say: “Le mani degli chef sono come le mani dei santi” – “The hands of chefs are like the hands of saints.” At Santi, White’s menu retells the story of his years living and working in Imola, the Amalfi coast, and the South of France, with a menu consisting of handmade pastas, meats, fish, vegetables, crudos, rotating specials, and large format dishes. It builds on his 36 years in the kitchen and traverses the whole of the Italian peninsula with a focus on seasonality. There will be wild game, truffles, and ragouts in the fall, ephemeral green market produce in the spring, and rare ingredients from across the globe incorporated thoughtfully and with nuance.

The Assistant General Manager is responsible for ensuring the excellence, creativity, and profitability of Santi’s dining experience. The position serves as a leader, educator, coach and mentor to the front of house staff and works under the direction and guidance of the General Manager.

* We believe in the power of belonging. It is a core human condition to want to be missed when we are gone.

We drew a circle that took her in” (Edwin Markham)

* We are hungry to understand if our interventions are having the intended impact. We will be meticulous in our data entry, and ruthless in our hunt to understand the data and learn from it. If what we are doing is not working, we will set aside our egos, intentions and preconceived notions and we will change what we are doing.

	+ Engaging in self-care outside of work so that our personal issues don’t interfere with our ability to focus on our young people;
	+ Open communication - Bringing all issues directly back to the person OR to the group session in a way that fosters a healthy team;

Eager to taste the dishes from the kitchen, he would wave off a plate and utensils and say: “Le mani degli chef sono come le mani dei santi” – “The hands of chefs are like the hands of saints.” At Santi, White’s menu retells the story of his years living and working in Imola, the Amalfi coast, and the South of France, with a menu consisting of handmade pastas, meats, fish, vegetables, crudos, rotating specials, and large format dishes. It builds on his 36 years in the kitchen and traverses the whole of the Italian peninsula with a focus on seasonality. There will be wild game, truffles, and ragouts in the fall, ephemeral green market produce in the spring, and rare ingredients from across the globe incorporated thoughtfully and with nuance.

The Beverage Director is responsible for ensuring the excellence, creativity, and profitability of Santi’s wine and spirits program. The position serves as a leader, educator, coach and mentor to the sommeliers, bartenders, and front of house line staff. The Beverage Director makes service, operations, scheduling and purchasing decisions that impact the financial health of the business and are responsible to do so in a way that is aligned with the culture and policies of Santi and BBianco Hospitality Group. The position combines management of people with staff education, creative input, and financial responsibility.
