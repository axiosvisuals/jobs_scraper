* *Are you empathetic to client needs and inspired by transformation and impacting the lives of millions of people every day?*
* *Are you looking to join a dynamic, inclusive team environment with a culture of collaboration and belonging?*

Well, this may be the role for you. Ready to design what's next?


In this role, you will work within a scrum team to bring the designs and ideas to life for new or improved web applications. This work will support a mix of internal and external clients. You will work with clients, product managers, architects, software engineers, and more to plan, design, develop, test, and implement impactful solutions that support companies with one to millions of employees.


You will start your day on a scrum call to prioritize and track work. Within the team you work on, you will choose user stories to work within a sprint cycle. You will spend most of your day developing and testing your code. Every three weeks, you will be involved in the release activities.


To thrive in this development career, you'll need to be an expert in Java (Java 8 preferred) and have a firm grasp on Spring Boot, Javascript, Angular and/or React. You'll need to be familiar with web services, RESTful APIs, and open source tools such as Apache KAFKA. Each sprint cycle could have a heavy front-end focus, a heavy back-end focus, or a mix of both, so you'll need experience working with front-end, scripting, and back-end technologies. Like our best developers, you are an enthusiastic creator eager to learn and take on stretch assignments. You strive to learn new technologies and find ways to incorporate what you learn into building your products.


As a Senior Developer, you will work closely with your team to lead and guide projects to success. You'll have a hands-on role designing, developing, debugging, and deploying software solutions where you can leverage your expertise with code complexities. You'll also serve as a mentor to the junior developers. In the senior role, you will balance the assigning of user stories through prioritization and consideration of the technical interests of each developer on the team. As part of our team, you'll find exciting challenges, get opportunities to grow your career, and develop solid friendships as we design what's next for ADP and the industry. Pace should not scare you. We still find time for a healthy dose of fun.

Yelp was created to connect people with great local businesses. As an Inside Sales Representative (ISR), you'll be working directly with these local businesses to help them achieve their goals through Yelp's various advertising programs. You'll work with small business owners via phone to determine their needs and aspirations and customize every sale to help make those happen. We succeed when we help our clients grow their businesses.

In this role, you will be directly responsible for selling advertising space on Yelp to local businesses across the US and Canada. Success in this role is measured by hitting and exceeding monthly sales goals, consistently staying ahead of daily metrics, and handling rejection in stride.

* You're savvy and can find your way around new tools and software (such as Google Suite & Salesforce).
* You're naturally curious and like to ask as many questions as it takes to find the answer.
* You're excited about being part of a team with colleagues from other states, and you find it just as easy to chat with your teammates during a virtual conference as an in-person meeting.
* You are committed to a high standard of integrity and being a teamplayer is important to you.
* You're an excellent listener, assertive, persistent, and persuasive - show us your grit!
* You are genuinely curious about people, local businesses, and possess the innate ability to inspire passion in others- you can't wait to show everyone the value of Yelp.

KFC Corporation, based in Louisville, Kentucky, is one of the few brands in America that can boast a rich, decades-long history of success and innovation. It all started with one cook who created a soon-to-be world-famous recipe more than 70 years ago, a list of secret herbs and spices scratched out on the back of the door to his kitchen. That cook was Colonel Harland Sanders, of course, and now KFC is the world’s most popular chicken restaurant chain, specializing in that same Original Recipe® along with Extra Crispy™ chicken, home-style sides and buttermilk biscuits. There are over 21,000 KFC outlets in more than 130 countries and territories around the world. And you know what? There’s still a cook in a kitchen in every last one of them, freshly preparing delicious, complete family meals at affordable prices.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/KFC","http://jobs.kfc.com","Louisville, KY","10,000+","$100M to $500M (USD)","Colonel Harland David Sanders was an businessman, best known for founding fast food chicken restaurant chain KFC and later acting as the company's brand ambassador & symbols of the company.","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/9d23ad9c3f843be3eda23cbd25b3aae3","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_headerimage/1960x400/9bbd302ee8a9602ca636862f461199f6","Sabir Sami","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_ceophoto/512x512/d541ed13e948788f628e01dd07640823"
