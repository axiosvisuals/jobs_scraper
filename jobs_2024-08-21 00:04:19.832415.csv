With our main campus located in Ithaca, NY, Cornell's far-flung global presence includes the medical college's campuses on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and Doha, Qatar, as well as the Cornell Tech campus located on Roosevelt Island in the heart of New York City.

Using Cornell’s far-reaching extension network and the college’s translational research methods, we deliver our findings directly to communities and families, ensuring that our work reaches those who need it most.
