Breaking Ground operates nearly 4,000 units of housing across New York City, along with housing in upstate New York and Connecticut. Supportive housing - affordable housing paired with services designed to help people maintain their homes for the long-term - is widely recognized as a proven and cost-effective solution to chronic homelessness.
  
  

But we didn't stop at providing housing. Breaking Ground's programs and services help people experiencing street homelessness - especially those who have been on the streets the longest - to come indoors. Through our Street to Home outreach program and transitional housing resources, we help people get, and stay, on the path to a permanent home.
  
  

Breaking Ground’s Street to Home program makes regular contact with more than 2,000 street homeless individuals and connects more than 500 individuals to housing, medical and mental health services, substance abuse counseling, and other essential supports each year. The caring, individually tailored attention clients receive at each stage of their journey from street to home ensures that more than 95% of people who Breaking Ground places remain stably housed.
  
The Housing Advocate works with street homeless conducting street outreach with the objective of engaging individuals to determine their eligibility for Street to Home services and to help secure appropriate housing solutions for all people who are street homeless. If chronic, the Housing Advocate will build a relationship with clients utilizing motivational interviewing to encourage the client to work towards permanent housing. If not chronic, Housing Advocate will utilize available resources to secure other housing placements. The Housing Advocate will always work with a partner and will spend most of the shift in an automobile conducting street outreach. The incumbent will respond to 311 calls and community concerns; participate in Code Blue and Code Red alerts; identify new hotspots/encampments and work to eradicate existing hot spots/encampments; conduct a bi-annual vulnerability index on all clients in their catchment area; and enter all required data into outreach database(s).

This includes curating and managing CARVART's material selections, ensuring they are not only current with trends but also pioneering in design. Establishing and nurturing vendor partnerships is key to maintaining a diverse and high-quality material portfolio.
  
  

In tandem with material management, the role demands a strategic approach to marketing, launch, and maintenance activities. This involves maintaining an organized coding system for the sample and material program, which streamlines the process and supports efficient operations.
  
  

Research plays a pivotal role in this position, as it involves delving into design, lifestyle, and cultural trends to inform new material collections and curations. The insights gained from this research are then transformed into tangible content for the marketing team, enabling them to engage with the industry effectively.
  
  

Creating content that resonates with customers and influences their experience is paramount. This content is grounded in design principles such as biophilia, color theory, sensory responses, and the collective consciousness, which are essential in shaping human-centered design approaches.
  
  

Documentation and visual storytelling through photography are also integral to the role, as they provide a medium to share developments with representatives, customers, and internal teams. This documentation supports the establishment and delivery of proposed material collections and curations for the years 2022-2023, aligning with marketing strategies, purchasing requirements, and budget considerations.
  
  

Innovation is at the heart of the role, with a focus on fostering artistic experiences through events, art shows, trade shows, and cultural travel. These experiences not only inspire new collections but also contribute to the broader creative discourse within the industry.
  
  

Supporting the CREATE with CARVART initiative is another critical aspect, where the Product Manager empowers the sales team with knowledge about material choices and applications. This support extends to providing material training to consultants and vendor teams, enhancing their ability to communicate the value of CARVART's offerings.
  
  

Sales support is a multifaceted responsibility that includes delivering material content to the marketing team for the creation of sales tools, such as mock-up displays and presentations. This ensures that the sales team is equipped with the necessary resources to effectively showcase the materials to potential clients.
  
  

Lastly, the digital graphic platform requires leadership in developing the program's structure and process flow. This involves close coordination with project managers, estimators, sales teams, samplers, and vendors to create a seamless workflow. Developing guidelines, FAQs, and related definitions is also part of this process, which aids in training digital and graphic teams to maintain consistency and quality across all digital platforms. This comprehensive approach ensures that the Product Manager’s contributions significantly impact CARVART's material offerings and overall market presence.","","","","","","","","","",""

We're always on the lookout for talented individuals to join our team. If you're interested in a career with us, we encourage you to send us your resume and a brief introduction. **About the Companies:**


Elsewhere is a multi-room Brooklyn music venue and nightclub built by and for the culture-obsessed, managed by our sister promotions company PopGun Presents - an events collective with deep roots in NYC's emerging music community. We are here to empower artists, celebrate the diversity of our city, widen access to visionary and uplifting culture, and experience the joy of doing it all together.


If you share our passion for music and art without boundaries, and you're looking for the challenge of your career, we want to connect with you - join us and grow with one of the best teams in independent arts, hospitality, events, and culture.

 **You’ll love your time at Elsewhere because…**

* We believe in what we do, and foster a culture of respect (for all music & people), passion, and excellence
* You will work with teammates that are the best in the culture & events business
* You will be on the cutting edge of music, enabling emerging culture to thrive




* We are building a long-term business, that can support long-term careers in our industry

 **Elsewhere’s Values**

These values are real and guide all of our decisions in how we operate and how we treat people. This includes our decisions to hire, reward, and fire. Every single person at Elsewhere will be held to these standards. This is how we build a great team, achieve our goals, and do so enjoyably.

**INCLUSIVITY**


Elsewhere is a haven for our staff, artists, and audiences to experience the joy of expressing their authentic selves. Everybody has the right to feel welcomed and understood here, in direct defiance of all the ways our society tries to divide us up out there. We crave connectivity and togetherness. We’re curious about the unknown.

**OPTIMISM**


The chills we get experiencing transcendent music in a crowd remind us that a better world is possible. Elsewhere is a celebration of that feeling - of joy, wonder, and hope. We are here to have fun, and we reject cynicism in all its forms.

**RESPECT**


Our love for the game comes from a place of deep respect: for the extraordinary history of music and nightlife in NYC, for the working artists out there redefining culture, and for our staff who live and breathe it every night. To do right, we extend that respect to each other and everyone else along the journey.

**KINDNESS**


Our job means service: to our teammates, artists, customers, community, city, and to the culture. We can’t do this without being kind to ourselves, to each other, to our artists, to our audiences, and to our community. Be understanding, empathetic, go out of your way to help people out, be friendly, generous, considerate. We celebrate individuality, but there is no place for selfishness or ego.


**INTEGRITY**


We believe strong communities are built on trust, and so everyone must rely on us to be honest, transparent, and consistent. We live our values and stand by them even when it’s hard or inconvenient. We admit our mistakes and work to grow from them.

**PASSION**


There are much easier ways to earn a living. The renewable resource that keeps our team sustained is an unshakable conviction in some aspect of our mission, whether it’s supporting new artists, helping audiences discover music, building community, or shifting culture.

**EXCELLENCE**


To accomplish our goals we aim high, and work both hard and smart.

**CREATIVITY**


The beauty of culture is that it is always evolving, and so should we. We value out-of- the-box thinking, challenging “the way things are,” and imaginative leaps. Like in art, it is better for us to fail trying something new than to not be experimenting in the first place.
