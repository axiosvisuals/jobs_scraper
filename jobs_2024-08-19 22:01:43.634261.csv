* 3-5 years of content creation experience in a marketing setting
* Deep experience in design, editing and/or production
* Experience concepting and creating brand content across owned social channels

* Master of in-app editing across platforms, including TikTok, CapCut, Reels, and beyond.
* Proficiency in hands-on content creation, handling production and creative execution
* Ability to ideate & concept original ideas both independently and in collaboration with team members.
* Extensive experience concepting and executing original content across TikTok, Instagram (Reels, Stories, Feed), YouTube (including Shorts), and other emerging platforms.
* Ability to thrive in a fast-paced, deadline-driven environment
* Strong attention to detail and commitment to quality
* Passion for delighting clients and going above & beyond

**BASE SALARY RANGE**


**Our estimated range for this role is $65,000-95,000\\***


* Don’t let this range drive your decision to apply. Actual compensation packages are based on the level of skill and experience each candidate brings to their role. Similarly, there might also be a more senior or junior position available, that would be a better fit with your expertise. For example, a person may apply for a Senior Creative Producer role, and we may assess that their skills are at the Creative Producer level. Each level has its own compensation range.

UNICEF USA (“UUSA” or “We”) relentlessly pursues a more equitable world for every child, upholding the rights of all children and empowering every child, everywhere. We also support the fundamental belief that children should have a voice and role in shaping their futures and the futures of their communities.
  

Over eight decades, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has built an unprecedented global support system for the world’s children, and has boldly taken on the biggest, seemingly impossible challenges facing children. UNICEF relentlessly works day in and day out to deliver the essentials that give every child an equitable chance in life: health care and immunizations, safe water and sanitation, nutrition, education, emergency relief and more. UNICEF USA advances the global mission of UNICEF by rallying the American public to support the world’s most vulnerable children.
  

We know that sustainable change is attainable, but it can’t be achieved alone. It takes a committed team – individuals, governments, corporations, volunteers and staff – who demonstrate a relentless commitment to working tirelessly, day in and day out in some of the toughest, hardest to reach places. Big problems need big solutions, and we harness our collective, global voice and energy to do more good, in more places for children. We will never stop supporting UNICEF to develop smarter, more cost-effective solutions; scaling up proven, data-driven programs; and harnessing new technologies to create measurable change for children.

**About Us:**

Founded in 2017 by Carolyn Witte and Felicity Yost, Tia is the modern medical home for women. We are trailblazing a new paradigm for women's healthcare that treats women as whole people vs. parts or life stages. Blending in-person and virtual care services, Tia's ""Whole Woman, Whole Life"" care model fuses gynecology, primary care, mental health and evidence-based wellness services to treat women comprehensively. By making women's health higher quality and lower cost, Tia makes women healthier, providers happier, and the business of care delivery stronger — setting a new standard of care for women everywhere.



Tia has raised more than $132 Million in venture capital funding to date, including a recent $100 Million Series B investment, one of the largest early-stage rounds ever for a healthcare company focused on women. Tia has ambitious plans to scale its ""whole-woman, whole-life"" model to more than 100,000 women by 2023. We'll do this by growing virtual and in-person operations in existing and new markets while expanding its service lines to care for women throughout their entire lives - from puberty to menopause. Since launching in 2017, Tia has grown to serve thousands of women aged 18-80 with blended in-person and virtual care in New York City, Los Angeles, Phoenix and soon San Francisco.



We're building a world class team to reimagine women's healthcare. We're an interdisciplinary team of clinicians, researchers, designers, technologists and operators who have seen firsthand how broken the healthcare system is for women. We're united by a powerful mission to enable every woman to achieve optimal health, as defined by herself, as well as a shared set of values and principles that define our business, products, and culture.



Tia is building a culture of **excellence** — in people, process and product. This is our northstar value;


*What is excellence, exactly?*



Excellence about constantly elevating yourself, it is the process of constantly striving to perform to the best of your abilities, and identifying your top potential through constant learning, experimentation and evolution. Excellence is not about achieving perfection, as that insinuates a pinnacle. Instead, in our terms, excellence is about the pursuit of constant improvement. We're looking for people who want to go on that hard journey of constantly setting new personal records, and organizational records.



We practice excellence at Tia by demonstrating the following types of behaviors: We chose (and actively choose) excellence as Tia's highest order value because it crystalizes into one word several behaviors that we hold dear, specifically:



* A drive to **constantly improve through experimentation**, reflection. and an insatiable growth mindset — said another way, we're energized by the possibility of invention, innovation, and iteration


* **Being present in and grateful for the journey** — not just the goal line. Perfection is static. Excellence is a process (more on this important distinction below)


* **Asking why, then why again** — because accepting ""this is just the way it is"" is not good enough


* **Grit & perseverance** — a maker mentality that involves ""rolling up your sleeves"", *but also* deep care for oneself and for others


* **A commitment to uncovering talents** to unlock ""rock star"" potential across every individual



**Benefits (Clinic)**


* **Free Tia Membership:** Enjoy complimentary access to Tia's premium services.
* **Comprehensive Health Coverage:** Full-time employees receive medical, dental, and vision benefits, along with access to additional support for infertility services.
* **Insurance Package:** Gain coverage with life, AD&D, STD, and LTD insurance, and explore voluntary options for Critical Illness, Accident Insurance, and Life coverage for you and your family.
* **Financial Flexibility:** Take advantage of Health Spending Account, Flexible Spending Account, and Dependent Care Spending Account options.
* **Emotional Well-being Support:** Access Ginger+ (Headspace+) for Emotional Health Coaching and 8 Virtual Therapy Sessions for both you and eligible dependents aged 13 and above.
* **Retirement Planning:** Participate in our 401k program (no matching currently) to secure your financial future.
* **Team Bonding Opportunities:** Enjoy a travel stipend for team off-sites, complementing our commuter benefits program.
* **Time Off Flexibility:** Tia's comprehensive benefits extend to our Paid Time Off (PTO) program, providing employees with paid time off for vacations, personal needs, or as supplemental sick time.
* **Tech Excellence:** Depending on your role, access top-tier technology, including a 13"" MacBook Pro, iPad, or other Apple devices.
* **Professional Development Support:** In addition to our existing benefits, Tia values the growth of our medical care providers and offers a Continuing Education Reimbursement program.


Furthermore, excellence reflects the ""bigness"" and the ""boldness"" of Tia's mission and vision — a world in which every woman can achieve optimal health, as defined by herself.



Said another way, Tia's mission is NOT to make healthcare *incrementally better* for women. Instead, we've intentionally set out to create a fundamentally new paradigm for modern women's healthcare that's truly *excellent*. We believe that creating a company that operates in a culture of excellence will manifest in our product. Reaching this goal is not an overnight pursuit or a ""one and done."" We have not and will not ""get it right"" with the first swing. Rather, this higher order goal is a moving target — one we have not and will not ever fully ""achieve."" By design, we will never be ""done"" with this work, but instead, we will be continuously in pursuit of our mission. It is this continuous pursuit — the journey, not the finish line — that truly embodies excellence.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Tia-2f9f8c13","http://www.asktia.com","San Francisco, CA","201 to 500","Decline to state","Tia offers gynecology, primary care, acupuncture, and mental health therapy all under one roof.","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/26fcdbd472e06861424badda99dbfe34","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_headerimage/1960x400/e83a0915593398288099b1c874100749","Carolyn Witte","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_ceophoto/512x512/b34743fc99c7dbae9821fe250b20fff2"

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/U--haul","http://www.uhaul.com/","2727 North Central Avenue

**Primary Function & Position Overview**
At Public Prep, we believe all means all, and we have a deep commitment to serving students who need us most. The school-based Learning Support Coordinator (LSC) leads our implementation of our all means all belief within the school. The LSC serves reports to the Principal with coaching from the Network Assistant Director of Student Supports, ensuring that our scholars receive a diverse range of instructional and socio-emotional supports to meet the highest of academic expectations.

Your organizational systems ensure you get things done. You prioritize your time and fervently plan to maximize the time each day you spend moving adult practice.

You are excited to take the time to review IEP files, and you can implement systems to streamline and support the compliance side of Student Supports.**An A+ Communicator.** You’ve got a knack for speaking and writing clearly, succinctly and persuasively. You think about time, place, and format to share a message that will resonate to accomplish your goals, and you know how to tailor your communication to different audiences. **A gritty problem-solver.** You keep it cool when facing challenges, approach problems with viable solutions, and know when you need to roll up your sleeves to support your team. **A growth mindset.** You love learning as much as you love teaching and can’t wait to continue to grow as a leader and advocate for students.

ACC is one of the nation’s largest open-admission animal shelters, whose mission is to End Animal Homelessness in NYC. We touch the lives of nearly 30,000 animals each year. ACC is more than an animal shelter; we are a resource to the community, always seeking ways to keep the human-animal bond intact. With a 90% placement rate, our progressive, life-saving initiatives contribute to the successful placement of our animals. We strive to find loving homes for homeless and abandoned cats, dogs, guinea pigs and rabbits, both by adopting animals directly to the public and by partnering with more than 200 dedicated animal placement organizations (our New Hope partners). We also help keep NYC communities safe and rescue animals in need, responding to emergencies that involve animals as well as keeping our doors open 24/7 for people and animals in need.

The coordinator contributes to a dynamic, collaborative environment where volunteers and staff work together harmoniously on a shared goal.


ACC’s robust volunteer program has over 500 dedicated volunteers who work in varying roles from walking dogs and playing with cats to assisting with vaccine clinics to appearing on morning television promoting our pets. The Volunteer Coordinator works to support the program by recruiting, orienting, training, and facilitating the daily operations of volunteers. We are looking for a highly-motivated individual eager to work closely with our volunteers, to provide hands-on support and guidance, and also to handle a variety of administrative tasks associated with the program’s coordination and metrics.

**Fast-talking, glad-handing, double-dealing slicksters.**
----------------------------------------------------------

**Not our salespeople.**
------------------------


At Terminix Nation, our salespeople are relationship builders and problem solvers. They’re the engine that keeps Terminix running. And we reward them accordingly with a competitive salary and benefits including medical, dental, vision, a 401(k) with company match, and more. There are also opportunities to get trained, gain new skills, and build an awesome career.


But first things first. When you start in sales at Terminix Nation, you’ll get down and dirty. You’ll learn how to inspect and identify infestations (or potential infestations) of all kinds of organisms, insects, birds, and other pests. You’ll learn all about what we do and how you can make your clients’ properties safer and more secure. Once you’ve learned that, you’ll turn your talents to proposals and presentations that result in sales.

**As a Commercial Sales Professional, here’s what you can expect**
------------------------------------------------------------------

* You won’t be tied to a desk. You’ll be out and about — mobile, independent, and growing your career with a clear view of next steps. You’ll be the face of Terminix to your local community (with the backing of a national brand), and your clients will count on you to protect their businesses and livelihoods.
* When you first join Terminix Nation, you’ll spend a few months in training. Once you’ve got that and some state required licenses and certificates under your belt, you’ll take the lead with your own customers.
* You’ll get rewarded with competitive pay and robust benefits to cover you and your family. As a teammate, you will be eligible for a 401(k) with company match, company-paid life insurance, tuition reimbursement, and a generous student loan repayment program. You put in the work, and you’ll reap the rewards.
* You’ll be part of a community — bonus points if you’re already a leader in yours. Our bonds are strong at Terminix Nation and the relationships we develop in the communities we serve are unparalleled. Our teammates give back through volunteering, donations, scholarships, and more.
* You’ll be onboarded and trained by the best of ’em. You’ll get paid to get licensed, something you’ll have for a lifetime. You’ll know how to bust bugs at home, too.

**What your days will look like**
---------------------------------

* Hit the books with training modules and hit the streets with on-the-job training with your teammates. You’ll learn product knowledge and sales techniques for selling the full suite of Terminix products. We’ll train and support you through state licensing and other company requirements.
* You’ll inspect and assess pest problems with precision and suggest Terminix solutions following company policy and pricing instructions.
* You must be obsessed with the customer’s experience — delivering exceptional service, following up to ensure satisfaction, and thinking creatively about how to grow the relationship. You’ll have to be thoughtful about navigating the intricacies of commercial properties and management. And if an account is delinquent, you’ll need to handle that with grace and effectiveness, too.
* Of course, you’ve got to like to sell solutions to problems. You will be expected to meet and greet potential customers to generate new business for the branch.
* There’s an opportunity to grow into a role you’re passionate about and fits your skillset — whether that’s management or another opportunity at Terminix.

**Some non-negotiables**
------------------------


There are some things you’ll just need to have or know to join Terminix Nation as a Commercial Sales Professional.

* A high school education or GED.
* Strong customer service, communication, and critical thinking skills — in fact, we’d be really impressed if you came to this role with related experience and/or training in sales.
* Some basic math skills — add, subtract, multiply, and divide in all units of measure, using whole numbers, common fractions, and decimals. You’ll need to be able to follow instructions for mixing on product labels.

**Straight talk about the physical demands of our work**
--------------------------------------------------------


We’re not going to sugarcoat it. The essential functions of this job have some physical demands (of course, reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the essential functions.) Here’s what we mean:

* You’ve got to be able to move up to 10 lbs. regularly and 11–20 lbs. frequently, whether that’s lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, or otherwise repositioning objects.
* You’ll move around a lot — regularly sitting, climbing, balancing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, and crawling. You’ll go up and down stairs, ladders, scaffolding, ramps, and poles. And you’ll need to keep your balance when walking, standing, or crouching on narrow, slippery, or moving surfaces. (You’ll definitely get your steps in.)
* The vision to perform detail-oriented activities at distances close to the eyes or within arm’s reach.
* Sometimes you’ll need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE), like an OSHA-compliant respirator, and you’ll need to be okay with regularly working in confined spaces, narrow aisles, or passageways (you know, where critters live).


This position offers a base pay plus commission.  

  

* $75k average compensation (base + commission) during first 12 months
* $20.19 - $22.00 during training


  

Actual annual potential is based on individual performance and our top Sales Professionals earn well over $100k annually.

We are proud to be a member of the Rentokil family of companies, the global leader in Pest Control and other services across more than 90 countries. We pride ourselves on being a trusted partner to many of the world's leading brands and serve consumer and business customers across multiple industries. We are extremely proud of our legacy of excellence and constantly work to fulfill our mission to ""protect people, enhance lives, and preserve the planet.""

**Three-piece suits. Cold calls in a cubicle. Lone wolves.**
------------------------------------------------------------

**Nope. Not here.**
-------------------

  

At Terminix Nation, we view sales as the natural result of building strong relationships and solving customers’ problems. If you’re nodding your head right now, we’d love to meet you.


Our sales team is the engine that keeps Terminix running. And we reward the team accordingly with a competitive salary and benefits — including medical, dental, vision, a 401(k) with company match, and more. There are also opportunities to get trained, gain new skills, and build an awesome career.


But first things first. When you start in sales at Terminix Nation, you’ll get down and dirty. You’ll learn how to inspect and identify infestations (or conditions conducive to infestations) of all kinds of organisms, insects, birds, or other pests. Sounds awesome, right? You’ll learn all about what we do and how you can make your clients’ homes safer and their lives better. Once you know that, you’ll turn your talents to proposals and presentations that result in sales.

**As a Residential Sales Professional, here’s what you can expect**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

* You won’t be tied to a desk. You’ll be out and about — mobile, independent, and growing your career on your own terms. You’ll be the face of Terminix to your local community (with the backing of a national brand), and your clients will count on you to protect their homes and their families.
* When you first join Terminix Nation, you’ll spend a few months in training. Once you’ve got that and some state required licenses and certificates under your belt, you’ll take the lead with your own customers.
* You’ll get rewarded with competitive pay and robust benefits to cover you and your family. As a teammate, you will be eligible for a 401(k) with company match, company-paid life insurance, tuition reimbursement, and a generous student loan repayment program. You put in the work, and you’ll reap the rewards.
* You’ll be part of a community – bonus points if you’re already a leader in yours. Our bonds are strong at Terminix Nation and the relationships we develop in the communities we serve are unparalleled. Our teammates give back through volunteering, donations, scholarships, and more.
* You’ll be onboarded and trained by the best of ’em. You’ll get paid to get licensed, something you’ll have for a lifetime. You’ll know how to bust bugs at home, too.

**What your days will look like**
---------------------------------

* Hit the books with training modules and hit the streets with on-the-job training with your teammates. You’ll learn product knowledge and sales techniques for selling the full suite of Terminix products. We’ll train and support you through state licensing and other company requirements.
* You’ll inspect and assess pest problems with precision and suggest Terminix solutions following company policy and pricing instructions.
* You must be obsessed with the customer’s experience — delivering exceptional service, following up to ensure satisfaction, and thinking creatively about how to grow the relationship. And if an account is delinquent, you’ll need to handle that with grace and effectiveness, too.
* Of course, you’ve got to like to sell solutions to problems. You will be expected to meet and greet potential customers to generate new business for the branch.
* There’s an opportunity to grow into a role you’re passionate about and fits your skillset — whether that’s management or another opportunity at Terminix.

**Some non-negotiables**
------------------------


There are some things you’ll just need to have or know to join Terminix Nation as a Residential Sales Professional.

* A high school education or GED.
* A valid driver’s license from your current state of residence.
* Strong social, customer service, and communication skills — in fact, we’d be really impressed if you came to this role with related experience and/or training in sales.
* Some basic math skills — add, subtract, multiply, and divide in all units of measure, using whole numbers, common fractions, and decimals. You’ll need to be able to follow instructions for mixing on product labels.

**Straight talk about the physical demands of our work**
--------------------------------------------------------


We’re not going to sugarcoat it. The essential functions of this job have some physical demands (of course, reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the essential functions.) Here’s what we mean:

* You’ve got to be able to move up to 10 lbs. regularly and 11–20 lbs. frequently, whether that’s lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, or otherwise repositioning objects.
* You’ll move around a lot — regularly sitting, climbing, balancing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, and crawling. You’ll go up and down stairs, ladders, scaffolding, ramps, and poles. And you’ll need to keep your balance when walking, standing, or crouching on narrow, slippery, or moving surfaces. (You’ll definitely get your steps in.)
* You must be able to safely operate a motor vehicle and make sure it and all other equipment is kept clean.
* The vision to perform detail-oriented activities at distances close to the eyes or within arm’s reach.
* Sometimes you’ll need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE), like an OSHA-compliant respirator, and you’ll need to be okay with regularly working in confined spaces, narrow aisles, or passageways (you know, where critters live).


This position offers a base pay plus commission.  

  

* $75k average compensation (base + commission) during first 12 months
* $14.90 - $20.00 during training


  

Actual annual potential is based on individual performance and our top Sales Professionals earn well over $100k annually.

We are proud to be a member of the Rentokil family of companies, the global leader in Pest Control and other services across more than 90 countries.

**Why should I choose Terminix?**

In addition to being part of an iconic brand with a rich 85 year history, here are some other highlights of what we offer members of the Terminix Team.
