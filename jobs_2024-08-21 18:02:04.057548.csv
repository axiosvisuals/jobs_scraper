**About the Company:**  

At SPEAR, we spend each day inspiring, caring for, and elevating the New York City metro area. Together, we have built a passionate and empathetic team motivated to become the best version of itself.

At our core, we develop people. By providing each other the ideal opportunities and tools to flourish—both personally and professionally—we have fostered a culture rooted in growth. And we have fun doing it!
  
This focus on professional development and organizational expansion has resulted in our collective achievement of several honors and recognitions from top medical, academic, and business communities. SPEAR recently received Columbia University’s Award for Leadership in Clinical Education, given to the top 1/10th of 1% of practices. SPEAR was named six times to the Inc5000 list of fastest growing private companies in America, as well as having been named by SmartCEO magazine as a Future500 company five times. SPEAR was also chosen to appear in Chase Bank’s National Ad Campaign, Mission Main Street, as a thriving small business committed to serving community interests. SPEAR was the first private practice to ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange when on May 4th, 2016, during small business week, the executive team was featured on MSNBC.
  
  

In 2016, SPEAR Physical Therapy was chosen as the American Physical Therapy Association Private Practice Section’s “Nation’s Top Practice,” recognizing the company for its dedication to innovation and excellence.
  
  

In 2020, at the peak of the pandemic, the SPEAR Physical Therapy team dedicated themselves to the New York City community. This dedication was a testament to the unrelenting commitment that SPEAR providers have for their patients—the resilience the team demonstrated, and the innovative care provided to our patients–during the events of 2020 are what led SPEAR to be awarded “The Nation’s Top Practice” by the WebPT Ascend Conference. To be recognized during this historically difficult year was a proud moment for the organization and all our incredibly devoted team members.
  
  

In the years to come, SPEAR will continue its path of growth, with further expansion planned beyond the New York City Metropolitan region.
