 **About the Roosevelt Institute**


The Roosevelt Institute takes on today’s greatest public policy challenges by advancing bold, cutting-edge research and policy ideas. We believe that the future of the American economy and our democracy depends on a new way of thinking about markets and government—and have successfully engaged with policymakers and the media to inform and shape public debate. Too few people hold too much economic and political power today, and we know that a stronger society is possible if we rectify this imbalance between private actors and the public. With a commitment to transforming corporations, restructuring markets, reviving democratic institutions, and reimagining the role of government, our work moves our nation toward a more resilient, equitable, and green future.

  

The Roosevelt Institute is a think tank, a student network, and the nonprofit partner to the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum that, together, are learning from the past and working to redefine our collective future. Focusing on corporate and public power, labor and wages, and the economics of race and gender inequality, the Roosevelt Institute unifies experts, invests in young leaders, and advances progressive policies that bring the legacy of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt into the 21st century.

 **Our Culture**


At Roosevelt, we recognize that the culture of the workplace and opportunities for career growth and development are important to all. We believe that diversity of background and experience among our people make our work to rewrite the rules of our social and economic realities stronger. Roosevelt is an equal opportunity employer and, as such, affirms in policy and practice to consider all applications in all job classifications, without regard to race, color, creed, national origin, sex, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital status, familial status, military status, height and weight, genetic predisposition or carrier status, arrest record, or other legally protected status. We strongly encourage people with diverse work and life experiences, diverse educational backgrounds, and diverse cultures to apply.

 **What You’ll Do**

  

The Government Relations Hill Liaison will play a key role in bringing the Roosevelt Institute and Roosevelt Forward’s paradigm-shifting ideas to policymakers in the House, Senate, and in federal agencies. The Liaison will work with the Roosevelt Institute’s think tank to identify the most Hill-relevant and actionable portions of research and briefs and will create and execute strategies to bring that work to policymakers on the Hill. In addition, the Hill Liaison will develop and maintain relationships with staff in priority congressional offices and committees.

  

The Government Relations (GR) team is the connective tissue between the Roosevelt Institute and the government at all levels. The team regularly engages with members of Congress and their staff, leaders in federal agencies and the Executive Branch, and state and local officials. This role will report to both the Managing Director of Appointments and the Managing Director of Government Relations. This is a nonmanagement, unionized, team role.

 **Essential Functions and Responsibilities**

  

* Propose and implement Hill outreach strategies for key Roosevelt Institute think tank publications and other policy priorities
* Cultivate and maintain relationships with key congressional offices interested in the Roosevelt Institute’s work
* Translate the work of the Roosevelt Institute into language and formats relevant and accessible for a busy audience of staffers and policymakers

  

The above statements are intended to describe the general nature and level of work being performed by the person holding this position. It is not an exhaustive list of all duties and responsibilities. The Roosevelt Institute reserves the right to amend and change responsibilities to meet organizational needs as necessary.

 **What You’ll Have**

  

* Experience interacting with staff in congressional offices
* Familiarity with researching and understanding the jurisdiction of different congressional committees as well as the interests of various members of Congress
* Understanding of the federal legislative process and some knowledge of the executive branch and federal agencies
* Demonstrated grasp of progressive policies and priorities and an interest in promoting these priorities with lawmakers, agencies, and staff
* 3 years of experience at an advocacy organization or 2 years of experience in a congressional office
* A bachelor’s degree in economics, English, government, politics, public policy, public administration, communications, pre-law, or other relevant area of focus is preferred
