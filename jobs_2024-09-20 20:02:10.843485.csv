There are over 30M small businesses in the United States, but only a tiny fraction of them have a workplace savings program in place. As the savings gap in the country widens, it's imperative that every worker has access to and participates in their company's savings program, such as a 401(k) or 403(b). We believe that American workers should have easy access to an inexpensive, flexible, and intuitive solution to save for a brighter future.  

  

Unfortunately, prior to Vestwell, small businesses have been neglected and underserved, with expensive, inflexible, poorly designed offerings built on old, mainframe software. Vestwell is changing that, starting with rebuilding the core infrastructure for the modern era.  

  

Vestwell's north star is to be the engine behind a $30T industry, powering all payroll-deducted workplace savings programs for small-to-midsize businesses, such as 401(k), 403(b), IRA, emergency savings accounts (ESA), health savings accounts (HSA), 529 college savings, and alike.  

  

Vestwell's focus is to build the most flexible, powerful workplace savings and investment platform, delivered through the hands and minds of their financial services partners with the help of payroll provider partners. The team at Vestwell makes the hard stuff look easy, by combining the expertise of financial advice with the sophistication of a technology provider.  

  

As a result, workplace providers are able to bestow the advice and solution employers and employees have been asking for, while growing and scaling along the way. Employers get a cost-effective solution designed for their needs without all the headaches, and employees get a user-friendly portal that helps them achieve their long-term saving goals.


**WHY VESTWELL?**



With backing from leading FinTech investors, as well as a growing team of dedicated professionals of strong industry pedigree, Vestwell is at the forefront of a much-needed change in a 40-year old industry. Our team believes in the mission we've set out to achieve and we are working hard to get there. We're ambitious, honest, thoughtful, and fun.



**Who are we looking for?**

  


Vestwell is expanding and we're excited about adding a Client Success Coordinator to our client-facing team who is passionate about our mission to close the savings gap in America. At a high level, we're looking for someone who pays attention to detail, has great communication and problem-solving skills, can successfully juggle multiple priorities at once, and is a confident self-starter. Ideally, you have spent at least 1 year in a client-facing role.


**What will you be doing?**



A key component of Vestwell's mission to empower workplace savings is to make it easy and painless. A CSM's primary objective is to establish strong relationships with advisors, positioning themselves as an integral part of their practice and a key contributor to their success in the retirement space. *As a Client Success Coordinator, you will play a pivotal role in supporting our team to reach this objective, understanding our advisors' goals, and driving repeat business.*



As a Client Success Coordinator your day-to-day tasks will include:


* Partnering with CSMs and their top advisors to identify new opportunities for value creation.
* Managing a small book of business consisting of advisor relationships.
* Proactively identifying upsell and cross-sell opportunities on the back-book for the team.
* Supporting the team in meeting our KPIs, including revenue targets.
* Supporting CSMs with the scheduling and preparations for advisor business reviews, covering plan status updates and plan health checks.
* Partnering with CSMs and/or advisors to conduct education meetings for plan participants.
* Supporting the creation and maintenance of a comprehensive wiki and knowledge base for the team.
* Managing administrative requests from advisors, as well as maintaining and updating records within our CRM.
* Answering the general inbound phone lines, channeling inquiries to the appropriate teams, and ensuring follow up completion.


**Requirements**

  

*The Necessities*


* 1 year experience in a client facing role.
* Strong commitment to delivering superior service.
* Ability to collaborate effectively across teams.
* Open to working in a fast-paced environment.
* Positive and proactive attitude.
* Proficiency in Excel/Google Sheets, Word/Google Docs, Adobe Acrobat, and browsing network directories, as we operate as a paperless office.
* Excellent attention to detail and accuracy.


*The Extras*


* Knowledge of retirement plans and financial products
* ASPPA certifications or credentials.


The expected salary range for this position is $50k-$55k plus variable. Please note that salary bands are based on NY and other similar metro areas and may differ based on where the role is ultimately hired.

**OUR BENEFITS**



We're a growth stage startup with lots of exciting milestones ahead. We value health and wellness at Vestwell and in addition to a dedicated Employee Wellbeing Committee, we offer competitive health coverage and an open vacation policy. We have adopted a remote-hybrid office policy, but all employees are welcome at our bright, comfortable office with many workspace options in midtown Manhattan so everyone has a setting that is the most productive for them. We provide our team with all the equipment they need (plus a few perks!) to work effectively remotely. Oh, and naturally we have a great 401(k) plan!


**OUR PROCESS**  

  

It starts the same for every candidate: getting to know the team members through 1 - 2 conversations about Vestwell, your experience, and your interests. Next steps can vary by role, but the usual next steps are a skill or experience screen (e.g. a coding interview for an Engineer, a portfolio review for a Designer, deeper experience call for other roles) which leads to a virtual or in-person interview panel after that if the screens go well. *Before making an offer, our interview process concludes with a references check stage for your recruiter to meet with a current or former supervisor and peer.* We prioritize transparency and lack of surprise throughout the process.

Metropolis is an artificial intelligence company that uses computer vision technology to enable frictionless, checkout-free experiences in the real world.

We envision a future where people transact in the real world with a speed, ease and convenience that is unparalleled, even online. Tomorrow, we will power checkout-free experiences anywhere you go to make the everyday experiences of living, working and playing remarkable - giving us back our most valuable asset, time.

  



The Role



Metropolis is looking for a Director of Product Analytics to build our Product Analytics team, reporting to the Vice President of Product. You will have the unique opportunity to build the Product Analytics team from scratch, and by doing so, instill a culture of data-driven decision making within the Product team and the organization more broadly.



Your team will be responsible for quantifying potential priorities – helping the Product team decide which remarkable experiences to build – and measuring the impact of the products we choose to build, keeping us honest that we have delivered on our promises. You will create reporting to allow us to track our progress in real-time, distilling those into business insights that you will present to the executive team. You will collaborate with the Data Engineering and Application Development teams to define the data sources that are essential for your team's success, and to ensure that we are presenting a consistent, accurate, and relevant set of metrics to the organization.



The ideal candidate for this role is a player-coach, as comfortable setting your team's strategy as you are digging into the data to uncover insights yourself.

* Develop an innate understanding of our customers, our products, and our business objectives

* Provide strategic guidance for the business and the Product team, helping us determine where to invest resources for the greatest return
* Determine our approach to measuring customer satisfaction and use it to provide actionable insights to each of the Product teams
* Own our Product Analytics tooling, ensure we are gathering actionable data on the key moments in the customer journey, and create self-service resources for PMs
* Collaborate with the Data and Engineering teams to create scalable, reliable, and accurate reporting
* Collaborate with the Revenue Operations team to quantify the commercial impact of our Product releases
* Build a Product Analytics team to provide leverage for doing all the above


Requirements and Qualifications


* BA/BS degree, preferably in a technical field
* 10+ years of experience in product analytics, data science and statistics, with 4+ years of experience building teams in these areas
* Track record of providing valuable insights that shape the product roadmap and business, with measurable impact on user growth, satisfaction, and other metrics
* Proactive, thoughtful, and highly organized self-starter; thrives in ambiguity and solving open-ended problems without a clear right answer
* Excellent communication and collaboration skills, enabling you to build positive relationships and communicate complex concepts across the organization
* High proficiency in Python, R, SQL, and other data science tools/frameworks
* Experience with self-service analytics tools (e.g. Heap, Amplitude) and BI tools (e.g. Hex, Tableau)
* Experience working with ML, and experience using LLMs a plus

  


*When you join Metropolis, you'll join a team of world-class product leaders and engineers, building an ecosystem of technologies at the intersection of parking, mobility, and real estate. Our goal is to build an inclusive culture where everyone has a voice and the best idea wins. You will play a key role in building and maintaining this culture as our organization grows. The anticipated base salary for this position is $200,000.00 to 300**,000.00 annually. The actual base pay offered is determined by a number of variables, including, as appropriate, the applicant's qualifications for the position, years of relevant experience, distinctive skills, level of education attained, certifications or other professional licenses held, and the location of residence and/or place of employment. Base pay is one component of Metropolis's total compensation package, which may also include access to or eligibility for healthcare benefits, a 401(k) plan, short-term and long-term disability coverage, basic life insurance, a lucrative stock option plan, bonus plans and more.*","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Metropolis-79ecde57","http://metropolis.io","144 2nd Avenue North

The Urban Homesteading Assistance Board (UHAB) is seeking a Loan Officer & Program Director to join our dedicated team originating purchase loans for low- to moderate-income homebuyers.

**About UHAB**:

UHAB empowers low- to moderate-income residents to take control of their housing and enhance communities by creating strong tenant associations and lasting affordable co-ops. Since 1973, UHAB has helped form hundreds of tenant associations and transformed troubled rental buildings into 1,200 affordable co-ops, providing homeownership opportunities for over 25,000 families. With democratic community control at the core of our mission, we work to sustain this thriving affordable housing community for this generation and those to come.

We organize residents to be active participants and decision-makers in shaping their neighborhoods. UHAB’s programs address a full spectrum of affordable housing needs: from building resident power and organizing tenants as community leaders, to developing thousands of units of affordable housing across the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, and Manhattan, to making small loans to first-time homeowners, to preserving affordable co-ops through training, education, and technical assistance. UHAB’s programs address the needs of future generations through long-term solutions: developing new affordable co-ops, increasing energy efficiency and introducing renewable technologies, and strengthening housing policy.

**About the Lending Program:**

UHAB established a CDFI Exempt Mortgage Lender in 2018, HomeOwnership Lending, LLC (“HOL”), to fill a market gap in loans for affordable cooperative homes. Credit is hard to come by for the co-ops themselves and for those seeking to purchase co-op shares, due to factors including the unusual features of these buildings, the complex subsidies that go into their development, the shared-equity cooperative ownership structure, the fragile conditions of the neighborhoods in which they are located, and the low incomes of most of the residents and purchasers. The difficult credit conditions of recent years and increasing regimentation of underwriting have exacerbated the problem. HOL’s role is to address these issues and to work to improve the flow of credit to support the continued success of the co-ops and the eligible New Yorkers purchasing into them.

HOL is at a crucial stage in its growth and in need of a dynamic individual interested not only in the mission of expanding access to affordable housing but also in partaking in the strategic expansion of the loan fund. The Loan Officer & Program Director will originate loans to co-op purchasers and help to shape the direction and growth of the program.

Our Clinical Team is a group of caring and passionate professionals dedicated to improving the lives of our most vulnerable members. Our team includes physicians, nurses, social workers, medical assistants, behavioral health specialists and others who provide in-home primary care and transitional care services. A goal for this program is to improve our offering of palliative and supportive care services for members with advanced illness.



As a Patient Care Coordinator (PCC), you will be the central point of contact and communication for the primary care provider (PCP), medical assistant (MA), patients, caregivers, and external agencies. Your role involves overseeing the coordination of patient care, ensuring timely communication with healthcare professionals, and supporting the Senior Practice Manager to maintain optimal office operations and customer service standards.


***This role offers a flexible hybrid work model, combining remote work with opportunities to collaborate in person at our Lyndhurst office.***


**As a Patient Care Coordinator, you will:**


* Be the communication hub for the entire care team—whether it's patients, caregivers, doctors, or external health professionals. You'll play a vital role in ensuring everyone stays informed and connected.
* Advocate for patients by managing communication between them and healthcare providers, helping them navigate their care and ensuring they receive the support they need from home health, hospice, social services, and more.

* Collaborate with the care team to create personalized care plans for each patient, ensuring they get the individualized attention and care they deserve.
* Be a team player by stepping in to help the Senior and Associate Practice Managers as needed. Your flexibility will help keep the office running smoothly and ensure exceptional patient care.
* Get out into the field with the PCP to assist with basic care functions, and sometimes work independently to engage hard-to-reach patients for important HEDIS measures.
* Keep growing! We support ongoing professional development and encourage you to invest in your own self-improvement.


**Success in this role looks like:**



In the first 90 days, you'll contribute to process improvements across the In-Home Care team, assist in training new team members, and actively participate in team meetings.



By the 6-month mark, you'll demonstrate independent management of daily tasks like scheduling and documentation, while continuously optimizing workflows.



Long-term success includes taking on leadership in mentoring new team members, regularly contributing actionable feedback in team discussions, and managing complex cases that showcase your deep understanding of operational and clinical workflows.


**You should get in touch if:**


* You bring at least two years of experience in clinical care coordination or healthcare management and hold the necessary certifications:
	+ A current and valid Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) certification in the State of New Jersey.
	+ Basic Life Support (BLS) certification.
* You're fluent in both English and Spanish, with strong communication skills in speaking and writing.
* You have a valid New Jersey driver's license and access to reliable transportation.
* You're comfortable using technology, especially electronic medical records (EMRs)—bonus points if you've worked with Athena!
* You enjoy working with people from diverse social, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds and are passionate about providing care that meets their unique needs.


**Benefits Overview:**


* **Financial Well-Being:** Our commitment to attracting and retaining top talent begins with a competitive hourly rate. Additionally, we offer a performance-based bonus program, 401k matching, and regular compensation reviews to recognize and reward exceptional contributions.
* **Physical Well-Being:** We prioritize the health and well-being of our employees and their families by providing comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage. Your health matters to us, and we invest in ensuring you have access to quality healthcare.
* **Mental Well-Being:** We understand the importance of mental health in fostering productivity and maintaining work-life balance. To support this, we offer initiatives such as No-Meeting Fridays, company holidays, access to mental health resources, and a generous time-off policy.
	+ - Full-time hourly employees accrue up to 18 days of vacation per year
		- Clover recognizes 10 federal holidays including New Year's Day, Juneteenth, and Christmas. There are also 4 additional paid holidays, 1 floating holiday, and a Week of Rest (the last week of December)
* Professional Development: Developing internal talent is a priority for Clover. We offer learning programs, mentorship, professional development funding, and regular performance feedback and reviews.


Additional Perks:


* Reimbursement for office setup expenses
* Monthly cell phone & internet stipend
* Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) offering discounted equity opportunities

* Paid parental leave for all new parents
* And much more!


**About Clover:** We are reinventing health insurance by combining the power of data with human empathy to keep our members healthier. We believe the healthcare system is broken, so we've created custom software and analytics to empower our clinical staff to intervene and provide personalized care to the people who need it most.

Are you looking for a job where you can use your experience to propel your career into management? At New York Life, we will invest in you from the start to help you learn and grow as a financial professional first. We’ll train you in valuable skills, such as marketing, business development, and customer relationship management, and provide you with the tools you need to further your career. Then we’ll train you and provide you with access to the tools you need for a career in management.

**What we’re looking for**  
We’re looking for people who want to make a lasting impact on the financial well-being of individuals, families, and small businesses—motivated people who can answer yes to one of the following questions:

* Do you have sales or managerial experience in another industry?
* Have you previously run your own business?
* Do you have an MBA or other equivalent degree?

In the Accelerated Path to Management Program, you’ll start off as a financial professional, learning how to sell our products, building client relationships, and meeting specific requirements1 before transitioning into a management role.  
You’ll then undergo a six-month intensive training program designed to prime you for success as a manager. You will use that experience to understand how to recruit and coach others to success.

**What we offer**

**Your first year**  
You’ll learn firsthand about a financial professional’s role and day-to-day work by working as a financial professional for the first year of your career journey with New York Life. We will provide you with complete training, access to digital tools, and a comprehensive product suite.

**Training and resources**  
You will receive top-notch training that will give you an understanding and appreciation for the strength and value of  
New York Life. Beyond this training and support, New York Life will provide access to the resources you need to succeed day-to-day, including experts on hand to answer your questions and a suite of digital sales, prospecting and marketing tools that will help you attract and retain your clients with web, social and email content.

**Product Solutions**  
You will learn about our robust products and services that can help clients and their families achieve their financial goals.  
Together with its subsidiaries, New York Life provides a range of competitive insurance and financial products, including life insurance, annuities, long-term care insurance, disability income insurance, and investment products such as mutual funds through our broker-dealer, NYLIFE Securities LLC (member of FINRA and SIPC), a Licensed Insurance  
Agency. You will be required to hold securities licenses and FINRA registrations and affiliate with NYLIFE Securities as a registered representative before you can offer investment products.

**Your transition to a Field Manager role**  
After meeting specific requirements for the first 12 months as a financial professional, you will enter a specialized six-month Associate Partner training program. We’ll help you to lead and build your team of financial professionals.  
Throughout your career journey with New York Life, you’ll continue to have opportunities to grow and be promoted to increasingly senior levels of management.

**How we will compensate you**  
When you begin with New York Life as a financial professional, you will receive income that is performance-based.

If you meet the requirements and approvals to become an Associate Partner, you will receive a salary. The salary range for an Associate Partner is $60,000–$150,000 (in California, the salary range is $62,400–$150,000), plus you will be eligible for additional compensation related to the agents you recruit and develop (“R&Ds”). R&Ds are additional compensation that is designed to increase your income and to reimburse for any reasonable and necessary expenses we do not otherwise reimburse. You will also be eligible for medical, dental, and vision benefits, life, long-term disability, and accidental death and dismemberment coverages, a pension plan, and a 401(k) savings plan.

New York Life will value and reward your hard work and success. You’ll have significant income potential over time, because our field managers’ compensation is directly aligned with their recruiting performance and the production level of their team of financial professionals. The average income among our 586 recruiters at all levels in 2021 was $270,890.6

### **Roku is changing how the world watches TV**



Roku is the #1 TV streaming platform in the US, and we've set our sights on powering every television in the world. Roku pioneered streaming to the TV. Our mission is to be the TV streaming platform that connects the entire TV ecosystem. We connect consumers to the content they love, enable content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and provide advertisers unique capabilities to engage consumers.



From your first day at Roku, you'll make a valuable - and valued - contribution. We're a fast-growing public company where no one is a bystander. We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.

### **About the team**



The Ad Ops team at Roku plays a crucial role in driving the success of Roku's monetization strategy. This team is responsible for excellence in execution for our Direct IO and Programmatic businesses. This team books ad campaigns, QAs creatives, prepares reporting, and manages Deal IDs, using 1st and 3rd party ad tech.

### 


### **About the role**



The world is cutting the cord and streaming its TV online, a shift that has dramatically changed how advertisers target, reach and measure their preferred audiences in ways that broadcast TV and cable never could. Roku pioneered streaming to the TV and continues to innovate and lead the industry. While we are well-positioned to help shape the future of television and streaming media worldwide, continued success stems from our ability to innovate and deliver advertising products. Thus, we are looking for an Associate of Ad Operations to join our growing advertising operations team.

  



As an Ad Ops Associate, you will work closely with our Client Services, Inventory Management, and Product teams to make every campaign that runs on Roku a success.

* Contribute to strategic projects that will help drive revenue growth for Roku

  


### **We’re excited if you have**

* Analytical, project management, deadline-driven, and process-oriented personality
* Experience in display and video advertising with a premium publisher or agency
* Experience with IAB VAST
* Experience with GAM
* Worked on Direct IO and Programmatic campaigns

### **Benefits**



Roku is committed to offering a diverse range of benefits as part of our compensation package to support our employees and their families. Our comprehensive benefits include global access to mental health and financial wellness support and resources. Local benefits include statutory and voluntary benefits which may include healthcare (medical, dental, and vision), life, accident, disability, commuter, and retirement options (401(k)/pension). Our employees can take time off work for vacation and other personal reasons to balance their evolving work and life needs. It's important to note that not every benefit is available in all locations or for every role. For details specific to your location, please consult with your recruiter.

  


### **The Roku Culture**



Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We’re independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.



We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.
