As Regional Superintendent of Operations, you will oversee school and regional operations within your region in conjunction with your manager, the Chief of Operations for Schools (CO). Regional Superintendents of Operations are responsible for ensuring that their schools operate at the highest level, with systems in place that allow teachers and Principals to focus on instruction and academic achievement. The Regional Superintendent of Operations ensures excellent school operations through direct management of a “portfolio” of Directors of Operations (DOOs), or school leaders who lead all non-instructional aspects of the school.

* Build, implement, and monitor cross-regional operations initiatives (e.g. aligned toolkits for State Testing and School Launch; PD session facilitation and follow-up)
* Support hiring, on-boarding, management, and evaluation of all operations staff, including DOOs and school-based operations teams

**Leadership & Collaboration**

* Serve as an outstanding role model as a leader and manager, investing deeply in supporting and developing team members and growing their capacity to learn, contribute and engage in the work of the team and organization
* Partner with Regional Superintendents of Operations across Uncommon to foster consistent implementation of school operations priorities
* Work seamlessly with Regional Superintendents of Instruction to support Principal/DOO co-leader partnerships
* Partner with regional school support team on regional initiatives and systems (e.g. enrollment, child nutrition, government reporting, etc.)
* Serve as the liaison between schools and Home Office teams to strategically identify issues and implement sustainable solutions

  

**Qualifications**  

* Passionate commitment to the mission of Uncommon Schools and investment in our vision for being an anti-racist organization;
* Demonstrated experience with effectively managing, developing, and retaining team members;
* Excellent communication and relationship-building skills and ability to work towards a common vision with various partners (e.g. school leaders, regional leaders, Home Office teams, Uncommon families);
* Ability to effectively and strategically prioritize between multiple high-leverage, high-risk issues; outstanding judgment and understanding of the implications of decisions on schools and partners;
* Ability to thrive in a fast-paced, high-change organization;
* Excellent organization, time management, and follow-up skills; ability to demonstrate an appropriate sense of urgency.
* **Required Experience:**
* A minimum of 3-5 years of experience and a track record of success in school operations management;
* Experience managing a team to strong outcomes;
* A Bachelor’s degree is required, and a graduate degree in business or operations is highly preferred.

**Compensation for this position:** Candidates who meet all job description requirements will likely receive an offer of $162,600.
