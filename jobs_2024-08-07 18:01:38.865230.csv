FINRA offers immediate participation and vesting in a 401(k) plan with company match and eligibility for participation in an additional FINRA-funded retirement contribution, tuition reimbursement and many other benefits.
Time Off and Paid Leave\\*
FINRA encourages its employees to focus on their health and wellness in many ways, including through a generous time-off program of 15 days of paid time off, 5 personal days and 9 sick days (all pro-rated in the first year). Additionally, we are proud to support our communities by providing two volunteer service days (based on full-time schedule). Other paid leave includes military leave, jury duty leave, bereavement leave, voting and election official leave for federal, state or local primary and general elections, care of a family member leave (available after 90 days of employment); and childbirth and parental leave (available after 90 days of employment).

Important Information
FINRA’s Code of Conduct imposes restrictions on employees’ investments and requires financial disclosures that are uniquely related to our role as a securities regulator. FINRA employees are required to disclose to FINRA all brokerage accounts that they maintain, and those in which they control trading or have a financial interest (including any trust account of which they are a trustee or beneficiary and all accounts of a spouse, domestic partner or minor child who lives with the employee) and to authorize their broker-dealers to provide FINRA with duplicate statements for all of those accounts. All of those accounts are subject to the Code’s investment and securities account restrictions, and new employees must comply with those investment restrictions—including disposing of any security issued by a company on FINRA’s Prohibited Company List or obtaining a written waiver from their Executive Vice President—by the date they begin employment with FINRA. Employees may only maintain securities accounts that must be disclosed to FINRA at one or more securities firms that provide an electronic feed (e-feed) of data to FINRA, and must move securities accounts from other securities firms to a firm that provides an e-feed within three months of beginning employment.  

As standard practice, employees must also execute FINRA’s Employee Confidentiality and Invention Assignment Agreement without qualification or modification and comply with the company’s policy on nepotism.
Search Firm Representatives
Please be advised that FINRA is not seeking assistance or accepting unsolicited resumes from search firms for this employment opportunity. Regardless of past practice, a valid written agreement and task order must be in place before any resumes are submitted to FINRA. All resumes submitted by search firms to any employee at FINRA without a valid written agreement and task order in place will be deemed the sole property of FINRA and no fee will be paid in the event that person is hired by FINRA.*FINRA is an Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action Employer*

WCHS’s powerful educational program enables every student to graduate well-prepared for college and the world beyond it. Most importantly, all WCHS students mature intellectually, socially, and morally as a result of being an active member of a school community that endorses high expectations that challenge each student to achieve his/her full potential.

In order to fulfill its mission, WCHS is looking for exceptional teachers. Our teachers play very critical roles in realizing the core mission, philosophy, and unique youth-centered approach to the school’s educational design. WCHS teachers are not just classroom teachers, but school teachers—educators that are committed to facilitating the entire learning and instructional process and coaching young people to become independent learners, thinkers, and researchers.

**Prospective Williamsburg Charter High School Teachers:**

* Are committed to the idea that every child can succeed at high levels
* Believe that they have been called to teach and empower young people
* Demonstrate a commitment to providing students with a rigorous academic experience
* Are resilient, resourceful, relentless, and well-able to adapt to the many changes that can happen in an organization focused solely on doing what is best for students
* Excel at working in a highly collaborative, professional setting but can also work independently

* Are committed to inquiry-based teaching

* Are reflective and willing to improve upon their practice through professional development and support
* Effectively manage their time, resources, and technology
* Are convinced of the transformative power of education for all students, families, and educators

**Position Description**

The ideal Williamsburg Charter High School teacher will provide our students with rigorous instruction. They will be responsible for the following:

Teacher as Advisor

As students transition to high school, one of the things they could lose is the comfort of having a teacher who understands their background, challenges, and successes. Research has shown that this relationship is a key part of having students feel accounted for and by extension, accountable. In support of our students, our teachers are also Advisors to between 12-15 students for the duration of their high school career. This allows the teacher to become a part of the developmental process of their students and allows each family to have a primary contact within the school at all times. Advisors serve students and families by:

* Taking complete ownership of the academic, behavioral, and overall success of a group of 12-15 students
* Ensuring advisees are in attendance, punctual, excelling in all their classes, and seeking out appropriate support
* Creating an advisory period that acts as ‘home base’ for each student
* Being the academic expert on each advisee
* Acting as the liaise between the student, the family, and the school teams
* Teaching the advisory curriculum that has been created for their advisees’ grade
* Accompanying advisees on educational field trips as determined by the School Leader
* Contacting their advisee’s families a minimum of seven times a year and responding within 24 hours to all communications from their advisee’s families
* Developing and overseeing Individual Student Support Plan plans twice a year for each of their advisees
* Facilitating discipline-related required meetings on behalf of their advisees
* Performing any other advisor-related duties as requested

Ensuring Student Learning Through Data-driven Instruction:

* Prepare rigorous, student-centered lesson plans that will engage and motivate students to learn
* Plan standards-based units of study with clear, intended outcomes and goals in mind
* Provide meaningful feedback on student work to determine student progress and to make suggestions for improvement
* Proactively and relentlessly seek new ways to promote student learning
* Create thoughtful, standards-based assessments
* Work closely with school leaders and colleagues, using data to drive instruction and by extension, consistently raising student achievement and intervening with improvement plans and support for struggling students
* Have fun and pass the love of learning onto students!
* Design opportunities for students to use the world around them as a classroom through field trips and or/inviting guests into the classroom as appropriate
* Hold students to high behavioral and academic expectations and support students to succeed
* Model professional and collegial behavior for students
* Engage in the process of collaborative evaluation with school leaders
* Ensure that students are well-prepared for all New York State exams and WCHS interim assessments

Personal Commitment to On-Going Learning

* Participate in all assemblies, meetings, school-sponsored events, and professional development activities offered during or after work hours
* Participate in focus groups, evaluations, and committees as requested to assist with the constant improvement of the school as a whole
* Participate and support WCHS open-door classroom policy, allowing parents and teachers and other stakeholders to informally observe your work and actively seeking to observe the work of your colleagues for professional development

Parabola is the spreadsheet alternative where you combine the data running throughout your company and create automated processes.



Pull in data from any source you can imagine—from scattered spreadsheets and tools, to emails and PDFs—and build logic that replicates the manual work you do every day. Use our canvas to combine and transform your data, and surface the results to the right people at the right time so you can do more with the data you rely on. In the process, you’ll codify the steps for every workflow you manage so they become repeatable, shareable, and usable for the whole team.



Create solutions for the problems you’ve always wanted to solve, and make your work more shareable and impactful along the way.

**About the role:**



Parabola is looking for an ops and process savvy Demand Generation Lead to join our team in our quest to get Parabola into the hands of as many operators as possible.

Our Demand Generation Lead will be primarily responsible for deploying and measuring the efficacy of top-of-funnel email programs designed to move a specific group of accounts through the funnel (i.e. an ABX motion).

This is a unique and exciting role for the right person – your current position might be center around Demand Generation, GTM Operations, Business Development – or somewhere in-between.

* Ideate, execute and track the efficacy of scaled/automated outbound email playbooks in a 1-to-many context, in pursuit of generating awareness amidst target accounts and moving them through the funnel
* Architect a modern GTM stack, identifying and implementing opportunities to stand up new automation and creative personalization tactics
* Make recommendations and deploy tests to continuously improve our messaging, scaled personalization and ICP-targeting to help us deliver on pipeline goals
* Work with the broader GTM team to identify and roll out new triggers, signals or other 3rd party data points that we can leverage for powerful campaign
* Partner with sales, product and the broader marketing team to roll out and capitalize on campaigns & tactics within various audiences


**What (we think) you’ll need to do it:**


* 3-6 years of Demand Gen, GTM Ops or Biz Dev experience at high growth B2B SaaS companies with a track record of delivering on concrete top-of-funnel goals
* Demonstrated success in executing and scaling high performing and creative email marketing campaigns using a modern tech stack (Outreach, SFDC, Hubspot, Clay, Apollo, LI Sales Nav, etc)
* Excellent communication, writing and interpersonal skills possessing the ability to engage with a broad range of clients, prospects and colleagues

**Three-piece suits. Cold calls in a cubicle. Lone wolves.****Nope. Not here.**  
At Terminix Nation, we view sales as the natural result of building strong relationships and solving customers’ problems. If you’re nodding your head right now, we’d love to meet you.  
Our sales team is the engine that keeps Terminix running. And we reward the team accordingly with a competitive salary and benefits — including medical, dental, vision, a 401(k) with company match, and more. There are also opportunities to get trained, gain new skills, and build an awesome career.

But first things first. When you start in sales at Terminix Nation, you’ll get down and dirty. You’ll learn how to inspect and identify infestations (or conditions conducive to infestations) of all kinds of organisms, insects, birds, or other pests. Sounds awesome, right? You’ll learn all about what we do and how you can make your clients’ homes safer and their lives better. Once you know that, you’ll turn your talents to proposals and presentations that result in sales.

**As a Residential Sales Professional, here’s what you can expect** 

* You won’t be tied to a desk. You’ll be out and about — mobile, independent, and growing your career on your own terms. You’ll be the face of Terminix to your local community (with the backing of a national brand), and your clients will count on you to protect their homes and their families.
* When you first join Terminix Nation, you’ll spend a few months in training. Once you’ve got that and some state required licenses and certificates under your belt, you’ll take the lead with your own customers.
* You’ll get rewarded with competitive pay and robust benefits to cover you and your family. As a teammate, you will be eligible for a 401(k) with company match, company-paid life insurance, tuition reimbursement, and a generous student loan repayment program. You put in the work, and you’ll reap the rewards.
* You’ll be part of a community – bonus points if you’re already a leader in yours. Our bonds are strong at Terminix Nation and the relationships we develop in the communities we serve are unparalleled. Our teammates give back through volunteering, donations, scholarships, and more.
* You’ll be onboarded and trained by the best of ’em. You’ll get paid to get licensed, something you’ll have for a lifetime. You’ll know how to bust bugs at home, too.

**What your days will look like**

* Hit the books with training modules and hit the streets with on-the-job training with your teammates. You’ll learn product knowledge and sales techniques for selling the full suite of Terminix products. We’ll train and support you through state licensing and other company requirements.
* You’ll inspect and assess pest problems with precision and suggest Terminix solutions following company policy and pricing instructions.
* You must be obsessed with the customer’s experience — delivering exceptional service, following up to ensure satisfaction, and thinking creatively about how to grow the relationship. And if an account is delinquent, you’ll need to handle that with grace and effectiveness, too.
* Of course, you’ve got to like to sell solutions to problems. You will be expected to meet and greet potential customers to generate new business for the branch.
* There’s an opportunity to grow into a role you’re passionate about and fits your skillset — whether that’s management or another opportunity at Terminix.

**Some non-negotiables**  
There are some things you’ll just need to have or know to join Terminix Nation as a Residential Sales Professional.

* A high school education or GED.
* A valid driver’s license from your current state of residence.
* Strong social, customer service, and communication skills — in fact, we’d be really impressed if you came to this role with related experience and/or training in sales.
* Some basic math skills — add, subtract, multiply, and divide in all units of measure, using whole numbers, common fractions, and decimals. You’ll need to be able to follow instructions for mixing on product labels.

**Straight talk about the physical demands of our work**  
We’re not going to sugarcoat it. The essential functions of this job have some physical demands (of course, reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the essential functions.) Here’s what we mean:

* You’ve got to be able to move up to 10 lbs. regularly and 11–20 lbs. frequently, whether that’s lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, or otherwise repositioning objects.
* You’ll move around a lot — regularly sitting, climbing, balancing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, and crawling. You’ll go up and down stairs, ladders, scaffolding, ramps, and poles. And you’ll need to keep your balance when walking, standing, or crouching on narrow, slippery, or moving surfaces. (You’ll definitely get your steps in.)
* You must be able to safely operate a motor vehicle and make sure it and all other equipment is kept clean.
* The vision to perform detail-oriented activities at distances close to the eyes or within arm’s reach.
* Sometimes you’ll need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE), like an OSHA-compliant respirator, and you’ll need to be okay with regularly working in confined spaces, narrow aisles, or passageways (you know, where critters live).

For more information about our benefits, see below!

We are proud to be a member of the Rentokil family of companies, the global leader in Pest Control and other services across more than 90 countries. We pride ourselves on being a trusted partner to many of the world's leading brands and serve consumer and business customers across multiple industries. We are extremely proud of our legacy of excellence and constantly work to fulfill our mission to ""protect people, enhance lives, and preserve the planet.""

**Three-piece suits. Cold calls in a cubicle. Lone wolves.****Nope. Not here.**  
At Terminix Nation, we view sales as the natural result of building strong relationships and solving customers’ problems. If you’re nodding your head right now, we’d love to meet you.  
Our sales team is the engine that keeps Terminix running. And we reward the team accordingly with a competitive salary and benefits — including medical, dental, vision, a 401(k) with company match, and more. There are also opportunities to get trained, gain new skills, and build an awesome career.

But first things first. When you start in sales at Terminix Nation, you’ll get down and dirty. You’ll learn how to inspect and identify infestations (or conditions conducive to infestations) of all kinds of organisms, insects, birds, or other pests. Sounds awesome, right? You’ll learn all about what we do and how you can make your clients’ homes safer and their lives better. Once you know that, you’ll turn your talents to proposals and presentations that result in sales.

**As a Residential Sales Professional, here’s what you can expect** 

* You won’t be tied to a desk. You’ll be out and about — mobile, independent, and growing your career on your own terms. You’ll be the face of Terminix to your local community (with the backing of a national brand), and your clients will count on you to protect their homes and their families.
* When you first join Terminix Nation, you’ll spend a few months in training. Once you’ve got that and some state required licenses and certificates under your belt, you’ll take the lead with your own customers.
* You’ll get rewarded with competitive pay and robust benefits to cover you and your family. As a teammate, you will be eligible for a 401(k) with company match, company-paid life insurance, tuition reimbursement, and a generous student loan repayment program. You put in the work, and you’ll reap the rewards.
* You’ll be part of a community – bonus points if you’re already a leader in yours. Our bonds are strong at Terminix Nation and the relationships we develop in the communities we serve are unparalleled. Our teammates give back through volunteering, donations, scholarships, and more.
* You’ll be onboarded and trained by the best of ’em. You’ll get paid to get licensed, something you’ll have for a lifetime. You’ll know how to bust bugs at home, too.

**What your days will look like**

* Hit the books with training modules and hit the streets with on-the-job training with your teammates. You’ll learn product knowledge and sales techniques for selling the full suite of Terminix products. We’ll train and support you through state licensing and other company requirements.
* You’ll inspect and assess pest problems with precision and suggest Terminix solutions following company policy and pricing instructions.
* You must be obsessed with the customer’s experience — delivering exceptional service, following up to ensure satisfaction, and thinking creatively about how to grow the relationship. And if an account is delinquent, you’ll need to handle that with grace and effectiveness, too.
* Of course, you’ve got to like to sell solutions to problems. You will be expected to meet and greet potential customers to generate new business for the branch.
* There’s an opportunity to grow into a role you’re passionate about and fits your skillset — whether that’s management or another opportunity at Terminix.

**Some non-negotiables**  
There are some things you’ll just need to have or know to join Terminix Nation as a Residential Sales Professional.

* A high school education or GED.
* A valid driver’s license from your current state of residence.
* Strong social, customer service, and communication skills — in fact, we’d be really impressed if you came to this role with related experience and/or training in sales.
* Some basic math skills — add, subtract, multiply, and divide in all units of measure, using whole numbers, common fractions, and decimals. You’ll need to be able to follow instructions for mixing on product labels.

**Straight talk about the physical demands of our work**  
We’re not going to sugarcoat it. The essential functions of this job have some physical demands (of course, reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the essential functions.) Here’s what we mean:

* You’ve got to be able to move up to 10 lbs. regularly and 11–20 lbs. frequently, whether that’s lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, or otherwise repositioning objects.
* You’ll move around a lot — regularly sitting, climbing, balancing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, and crawling. You’ll go up and down stairs, ladders, scaffolding, ramps, and poles. And you’ll need to keep your balance when walking, standing, or crouching on narrow, slippery, or moving surfaces. (You’ll definitely get your steps in.)
* You must be able to safely operate a motor vehicle and make sure it and all other equipment is kept clean.
* The vision to perform detail-oriented activities at distances close to the eyes or within arm’s reach.
* Sometimes you’ll need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE), like an OSHA-compliant respirator, and you’ll need to be okay with regularly working in confined spaces, narrow aisles, or passageways (you know, where critters live).

#### **About LaunchDarkly:**



Modern software delivery was supposed to be the foundation for a thriving digital business but reality has proven otherwise.

The LaunchDarkly platform helps developers innovate on new features faster while protecting them with a safety valve to instantly rewind when things go wrong. Developers can target product experiences to any customer segment and maximize the business impact of every feature. And by gradually rolling out new application components, they escape nightmare ""big-bang"" technology migrations.



The LaunchDarkly platform was built to guide engineers to the next frontier of DevOps by:


* Improving the velocity and stability of software releases, without the fear of end customer outages
* Delivering targeted experiences by easily personalizing features to customer cohorts
* Maximizing the business impact of every feature through the ability to experiment and optimize
* Coordinating the release and optimization of software to provide consistent experiences across mobile platforms and device types
* Improving the effectiveness and productivity of engineering teams, by providing insights into engineering cadence and stability

We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

Notion uses RippleMatch to find top talent.**

  



### **About Us:**



We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.



We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.



Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day). ***This internship will take place from Jan - Apr (based on your summer schedule) and you will need to be able to work out of our SF or NY office during this time.***


### **About The Role:**



Mobile devices have reshaped personal computing—the power of a desktop now fits in our pockets. By giving everyone the building blocks to create their own tools, we'll solve more problems wherever we go. A delightful, intuitive mobile experience: that's our guiding light, and we need Android engineers to make it a reality.



During your 12-week internship, you will be paired with a mentor that will help guide you as you work closely with our team to build and ship impactful projects. These projects will drive valuable impact to our customers and engineers. From product engineering, mobile, to infrastructure and security, we have opportunities available on different teams. Take a look at what our past intern cohort worked on with our Blog post here and here and TikTok post.


### **What You'll Achieve:**


* Write clean, secure, tested, and documented code.
* You'll collaborate with the team to strategize, mold, and develop innovative features for our Android application.
* At our core, we prioritize crafting top-tier applications. Your role could involve enhancing the Android app's performance, reliability, and overall refinement. Additionally, you'll have the opportunity to optimize aspects of the app within the web stack.

### **Qualifications:**


* Pursuing a bachelor's or master's in computer science, engineering, or another related field. Targeting a 2025 or early 2026 full-time start date and must graduate between June 2025 - December 2025.
* Previous mobile internship experience.
* Working towards a proficiency of one or more programming languages such as Kotlin, Swift, Java, Typescript, Node.js, Swift, Go, Python, or Rust.
* You find large challenges exciting and enjoy discovering problems as much as solving them.
* You are able to problem-solve and adapt to changing priorities in a fast-paced, dynamic environment.
* This internship will take place from Jan - Apr and you will need to be able to work out of our NY office during this time.

### **Skills You'll Need to Bring:**


* **Thoughtful problem-solving:** For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.
* **For a mobile internship:** You have a passion for Android or iOS development and are excited to work on large scale challenges with cutting-edge technology.
* **Put users first:** You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad.
* **Not ideological about technology:** To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.
* **Empathetic communication:** You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.
* **Team player:** For you, work isn't a solo endeavor. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same.

### **Nice to Haves:**


* You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Android SDK, Dagger, Swift, React, TypeScript, Postgres.
* You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.
* You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences.

Our customers come from all walks of life and so do we. We hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it makes our company stronger. If you share our values and our enthusiasm for small businesses, you will find a home at Notion.

Our organization is built for you! Dr. Dan and Mila Cohen founded True Dental Care because of their positive and negative experiences working at over 15 different dental practices. We believe that we are building the perfect place for you to grow and develop as you advance on your career journey.

* Our bottom-up management and leadership style promotes individual autonomy and innovative thinking. As a result, our idea of meritocracy favors bold and creative ideas that promote growth.

* Our organization started 6 years ago. Our offices are new, modern, and fresh. We have state-of-the-art facilities and equipment, creating an environment where you can focus on creative and strategic work without distractions.

Our Core Values and examples of personal attributes that are consistent with the values:

**Authenticity:**

The individual is sincere. Who they are in the office, is the person they are with close friends and family.

**Bad-ass:** 

Takes risk. Willing to go about life doing things they are a little uncomfortable doing to grow and learn. Is on a path of constant growth and expansion. Can be flexible and dynamic in difficult situations

**Empathy**:

Can feel and anticipate the emotional challenges of patients and team members. Acts with understanding and care and behaves in a way to alleviate fear and concern whenever it is encountered.

**Positivity**:

Regardless of their personal situation, you show up and put on a bright face. You don't behave in a way that suggests anything is wrong in your life. This is not to be confused with inauthenticity. An authentic, positive person may have a crappy situation that they are currently dealing with but will let the team know that life sucks then shows up and leads the team and patients. Their personal concerns must be set aside so their attention can be directed where it is needed the most.

**Ownership:**

This is a “done with you” organization. No one here will do your work for you. Owners see themselves in the work they do because they co-create it. We encourage your ability to contribute according to your domain of experience.

**Team Player:**

Understands that even though they are the primary producer, they are only a cog in a machine. Their role as dentist is not more or less important than the sterilization technician or receptionist. They look to ways to help the business advance, understanding that the advancement of the organization is a primary driver for their workplace experience and income potential.

Notion uses RippleMatch to find top talent.**



### **About Us:**



We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.



We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.



Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day). ***This internship will take place from May - August (based on your summer schedule) and you will need to be able to work out of our NY or SF office during this time.***


### **About The Role:**



Millions of people use Notion — and this number is increasing every day. That means a million people trust us to deliver a fast, reliable, and secure experience, and we value this more than anything. We want to keep earning trust, while also continuing to amaze our users with the tools they can build in Notion. This is where you come in. You will be a part of our first engineering internship class and will help us forge a performant and reliable path forward to Notion's future.



During your 12-week internship, you will be paired with a mentor that will help guide you as you work closely with our team to build and ship impactful projects. These projects will drive valuable impact to our customers and engineers. From product engineering, mobile, to infrastructure and security, we have opportunities available on different teams. Take a look at what our past intern cohort worked on with our Blog post here and here and TikTok post.


### **What You'll Achieve:**


* Write clean, secure, tested, and documented code.
* Design & enhance the Notion platform with new capabilities, as and when the need arises.
* Design, develop, and own new product functionality and/or infrastructure leveraging modern frameworks and tooling.
* Develop, fix and debug software for web services, databases, applications, tools, networks.

### **Qualifications:**


* Pursuing a bachelor's or master's degree in computer science, engineering, or another related field. Targeting a 2026 full-time start date. Must graduate between December 2025 - August 2026.
* Previous internship experience.
* Working towards a proficiency of one or more programming languages such as Typescript, Node.js, Go, Python, Java, Swift, Rust, or Kotlin.
* You find large challenges exciting and enjoy discovering problems as much as solving them.
* You are able to problem-solve and adapt to changing priorities in a fast-paced, dynamic environment.
* This internship will take place from May - September (based on your summer schedule) and you will need to be able to work out of our NY or SF office during this time.

### **Skills You'll Need To Bring:**


* **Thoughtful problem-solving:** For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.
* **For a backend internship:** You have a passion for learning how parts of a system fit together—from the user interface to the data model. Familiarity with relational database systems like Postgres or MySQL is a plus.
* **For a frontend internship:** You have a passion for learning technologies (CSS, Javascript, & React) and best practices in front-end architecture, including performance, accessibility and usability.
* **Put users first:** You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad.
* **Not ideological about technology:** To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.
* **Empathetic communication:** You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.
* **Team player:** For you, work isn't a solo endeavor. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same.

### **Nice to Haves:**


* You have expertise with specific technologies that are part of our stack, including Typescript, React, Electron, Node.js, AWS, and Postgres.
* You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.
* You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences.

Our customers come from all walks of life and so do we. We hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it makes our company stronger. If you share our values and our enthusiasm for small businesses, you will find a home at Notion.

**Three-piece suits. Cold calls in a cubicle. Lone wolves.****Nope. Not here.**  
At Terminix Nation, we view sales as the natural result of building strong relationships and solving customers’ problems. If you’re nodding your head right now, we’d love to meet you.  
Our sales team is the engine that keeps Terminix running. And we reward the team accordingly with a competitive salary and benefits — including medical, dental, vision, a 401(k) with company match, and more. There are also opportunities to get trained, gain new skills, and build an awesome career.

But first things first. When you start in sales at Terminix Nation, you’ll get down and dirty. You’ll learn how to inspect and identify infestations (or conditions conducive to infestations) of all kinds of organisms, insects, birds, or other pests. Sounds awesome, right? You’ll learn all about what we do and how you can make your clients’ homes safer and their lives better. Once you know that, you’ll turn your talents to proposals and presentations that result in sales.

**As a Residential Sales Professional, here’s what you can expect** 

* You won’t be tied to a desk. You’ll be out and about — mobile, independent, and growing your career on your own terms. You’ll be the face of Terminix to your local community (with the backing of a national brand), and your clients will count on you to protect their homes and their families.
* When you first join Terminix Nation, you’ll spend a few months in training. Once you’ve got that and some state required licenses and certificates under your belt, you’ll take the lead with your own customers.
* You’ll get rewarded with competitive pay and robust benefits to cover you and your family. As a teammate, you will be eligible for a 401(k) with company match, company-paid life insurance, tuition reimbursement, and a generous student loan repayment program. You put in the work, and you’ll reap the rewards.
* You’ll be part of a community – bonus points if you’re already a leader in yours. Our bonds are strong at Terminix Nation and the relationships we develop in the communities we serve are unparalleled. Our teammates give back through volunteering, donations, scholarships, and more.
* You’ll be onboarded and trained by the best of ’em. You’ll get paid to get licensed, something you’ll have for a lifetime. You’ll know how to bust bugs at home, too.

**What your days will look like**

* Hit the books with training modules and hit the streets with on-the-job training with your teammates. You’ll learn product knowledge and sales techniques for selling the full suite of Terminix products. We’ll train and support you through state licensing and other company requirements.
* You’ll inspect and assess pest problems with precision and suggest Terminix solutions following company policy and pricing instructions.
* You must be obsessed with the customer’s experience — delivering exceptional service, following up to ensure satisfaction, and thinking creatively about how to grow the relationship. And if an account is delinquent, you’ll need to handle that with grace and effectiveness, too.
* Of course, you’ve got to like to sell solutions to problems. You will be expected to meet and greet potential customers to generate new business for the branch.
* There’s an opportunity to grow into a role you’re passionate about and fits your skillset — whether that’s management or another opportunity at Terminix.

**Some non-negotiables**  
There are some things you’ll just need to have or know to join Terminix Nation as a Residential Sales Professional.

* A high school education or GED.
* A valid driver’s license from your current state of residence.
* Strong social, customer service, and communication skills — in fact, we’d be really impressed if you came to this role with related experience and/or training in sales.
* Some basic math skills — add, subtract, multiply, and divide in all units of measure, using whole numbers, common fractions, and decimals. You’ll need to be able to follow instructions for mixing on product labels.

**Straight talk about the physical demands of our work**  
We’re not going to sugarcoat it. The essential functions of this job have some physical demands (of course, reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the essential functions.) Here’s what we mean:

* You’ve got to be able to move up to 10 lbs. regularly and 11–20 lbs. frequently, whether that’s lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, or otherwise repositioning objects.
* You’ll move around a lot — regularly sitting, climbing, balancing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, and crawling. You’ll go up and down stairs, ladders, scaffolding, ramps, and poles. And you’ll need to keep your balance when walking, standing, or crouching on narrow, slippery, or moving surfaces. (You’ll definitely get your steps in.)
* You must be able to safely operate a motor vehicle and make sure it and all other equipment is kept clean.
* The vision to perform detail-oriented activities at distances close to the eyes or within arm’s reach.
* Sometimes you’ll need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE), like an OSHA-compliant respirator, and you’ll need to be okay with regularly working in confined spaces, narrow aisles, or passageways (you know, where critters live).
