Breast cancer is a complex disease with no simple solution. Research is the key to stopping it in its tracks. Founded in 1993 by Evelyn H. Lauder, the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF) is the largest private funder of breast cancer research in the world. We invest in the best minds in science—from those investigating prevention, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, and metastasis—giving them the opportunity to pursue their most innovative ideas. Our combination of investment and cross-disciplinary collaboration accelerates the entire field and builds momentum for new discoveries.  

  

Since its inception, BCRF has invested over $900 million in research, which has significantly contributed to a 43% decline in breast cancer deaths over the past three decades. BCRF investigators have been behind every major breakthrough in breast cancer research, and the field is moving faster than ever.  

  

Today, BCRF is the largest private funder of breast cancer research—and metastatic breast cancer research—worldwide and the country’s top-rated breast cancer research organization.

Launched in 2016, the IIDRP portfolio currently consists of multiple active awards in clinical and discovery research in collaboration with three pharmaceutical companies.  

  

The IICT program will have an emphasis on early-phase clinical trials for breast cancer treatment with the goal of accelerating promising new agents to patients. The IICT program is expected to fund two to three clinical trials per call for applications (starting in 2025), with study durations of three to five years.

**About St. Nicks Alliance AmeriCorps Program**

**Life at Abridge**
-------------------


At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.


Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

**Diversity & Inclusion**
-------------------------


Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

**Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud**
----------------------------------------------------------


We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process.

**Associate Teacher Job Summary:**



An associate teacher, also known as an assistant teacher or teaching assistant, plays a vital role in supporting the lead teacher and facilitating effective learning in the classroom. The roles and responsibilities of an associate teacher may vary depending on the educational level and specific school policies, but here are some common tasks associated with this position:


**Essential functions of the Associate Teacher job may include but are not limited to the following:**


* **Classroom Support:** An associate teacher assists the lead teacher in various classroom activities, such as preparing instructional materials, creating and printing homework, setting up equipment, and organizing the physical learning environment.
* **Student Supervision:** They help maintain classroom discipline and ensure the safety and well-being of students. This includes monitoring student behavior, managing conflicts, and addressing any immediate concerns that may arise.
* **Instructional Assistance:** Associate teachers support instructional delivery by working with small groups of students or individual students who may require additional attention or assistance while the lead teacher leads the whole group. They may reinforce concepts, provide clarification, or guide students through specific learning tasks based on data collected. Associate teachers also collect data while the lead teacher is teaching.
* **Grading and Assessment:** They may assist in grading student assignments, tests, and exams. This could involve scoring objective assessments, recording grades, and providing feedback based on data as well as under the guidance of the lead teacher.
* **Individualized Education Programs (IEPs):** In inclusive classrooms or special education settings, associate teachers may support students with individualized education plans. They collaborate with the lead teacher and other professionals to implement accommodations, modifications, or specific strategies to meet the students' unique learning needs.

This may be the case for the lead teacher in their classroom or another lead teacher in the grade level team. This involves implementing lesson plans, managing the classroom, and providing instructional support to ensure continuity in the learning process.


It's important to note that the specific roles and responsibilities of an associate teacher can vary depending on the educational context, grade level, and the needs of the students and school.
