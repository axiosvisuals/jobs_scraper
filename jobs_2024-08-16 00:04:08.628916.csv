The Center for Justice Innovation (formerly the Center for Court Innovation) is a non-profit organization that works with communities and justice systems to advance equity, increase safety, and help individuals and communities thrive. The Center's goal is to identify and resolve as early as possible the challenges that bring people into the criminal and civil legal systems. It does this in a number of ways—by developing and running programs that reduce the need for incarceration and enhance economic opportunity, conducting original research to identify what works, and sharing what we learn from our programming and research with those seeking to transform the justice system around the world.


The Center is a 900-employee, $100 million nonprofit that accomplishes its vision through three pillars of work: creating and scaling operating programs to test new ideas and solve problems, performing original research to determine what works (and what doesn’t), and providing expert assistance and policy guidance to justice reformers around the world.

**Operating Programs**


The Center’s operating programs, including the award-winning Red Hook Community Justice Center and Midtown Community Justice Center, test new ideas, solve difficult problems, and attempt to achieve systemic change within the justice system. Our projects include community-based violence prevention programs, alternatives to incarceration, reentry initiatives, and court-based initiatives that reduce the use of unnecessary incarceration and promote positive individual and family change. Through this programming, we have produced tangible results like safer streets, reduced incarceration, and improved neighborhood perceptions of justice.

**Research**


The Center's research teams are staffed with social scientists, data analysts, and lawyers who are academically-trained or have lived experience and who conduct research in the U.S. and globally on diverse criminal-legal system and justice issues. Their work includes evaluating programs and policies; conducting exploratory, community-based studies; and providing research translation and strategic planning for system actors. The Center has published studies on topics including court and jail reform, intimate partner violence, restorative justice, gun violence, reentry, sixth amendment rights, and progressive prosecution. The research teams strive to make their work meaningful and actionable to the communities they work with, policymakers, and practitioners.

**Policy & Expert Assistance**


The Center provides hands-on, planning and implementation assistance to a wide range of jurisdictions in areas of reform such as problem-solving courts (e.g., community courts, treatment courts, domestic violence courts), tribal justice, reducing incarceration and the use of fines/fees and reducing crime and violence. Our current expert assistance takes many forms, including help with analyzing data, strategic planning and consultation, policy guidance, and hosting site visits to its operating programs in the New York City area.

**Center Support**


A dedicated support team within the Center ensures the smooth functioning of operations across various domains, including finance, legal, technology, human resources, fundraising, real estate, and communications. Comprising 15% of the organization's staff, these teams provide essential infrastructure support and innovative solutions aligned with the Center's mission and values.

**THE OPPORTUNITY**


Launched in 1993, the award-winning Midtown Community Justice Center is one of the country’s first problem-solving courts. Seeking to reduce crime and incarceration and increase public trust in justice, the Midtown Community Justice Center works with neighborhood stakeholders to improve Midtown Manhattan.

In keeping with that goal, Midtown also operates upstream programming to divert adults and young people from prosecution.

Achieving success engenders a sense of self-efficacy - a ""can do"" attitude - and strengthens the ties between students and the world around them.

Members of the Strategic Accounts team function as strategic advisors, providing highly customized investment solutions and services to meet the unique needs of these key clients. The team’s success is measured not just by sales and asset growth, but also by the strength and depth of client relationships, client satisfaction, and the strategic alignment of PIMCO’s solutions with client goals.

* Demonstrate a strong interest in financial markets, macroeconomics, and investments through relevant coursework, certifications, internship/work experience and/or participation in professional organizations & campus clubs.
* Due to the technical nature of this role, all full-time members of Strategic Accounts must pass FINRA series exams. In addition, some members have furthered their credentials through an MBA and/or participation in the chartered financial analyst program through the CFA institute.
* Articulate ideas/strategies clearly, both verbally and in writing.

The Farmer's Dog is the fastest growing pet health service company in the US, and was born from a mission to change the landscape of pet health, providing dogs and their humans with honest, smart, and simple care – a fresh proposition in an industry riddled with manipulative and misleading marketing. We're starting by radically improving the $100 billion pet food market, replacing bulk bags of highly-processed pellets with a personalized subscription service that sends healthy, freshly-made dog food, balanced by top veterinary nutritionists, directly to customers' doors. Our ultimate goal is to create innovative, honest, and delightful experiences across all aspects of pet care, and we believe our direct-to-consumer business model, holistic approach to growth, and dynamic and forward-thinking culture uniquely position us to shepherd this backwards industry into the future.



To date, The Farmer's Dog has delivered hundreds of millions of meals nationwide and raised over $150M in funding to help us build a company as healthy as the dogs who are eating those meals. Join us as we continue to develop ways of bringing peace of mind to our customers, health to their companions, and much-needed change to the way people feed and care for their pets.

Douglaston Development, Levine Builders, and Clinton Management are a dynamic privately held group of companies with a unique owner-builder-manager advantage, known collectively as The Douglaston Companies.


The Douglaston Companies started with the founding of Levine Builders in 1979 with just two people. Standing by our core values of integrity and ethics for the past four decades the firm has grown to 200 employees. By providing general contracting and construction management services, Levine Builders has built, renovated and rehabilitated thousands of residential units and millions of square feet of commercial, hotel, office buildings, retail centers, religious, educational, and healthcare facilities.


With the later establishment of Douglaston Development as the driving engine of the organization, the two companies worked in unison to leverage each others expertise to develop and build most complex projects while also growing and thriving in challenging markets.


In 2002, Clinton Management was founded to manage the expanding portfolio of developments created by Douglaston Development and constructed by Levine Builders. Clinton Management oversees a broad portfolio of moderate-income housing, luxury apartments, commercial, and retail properties.
