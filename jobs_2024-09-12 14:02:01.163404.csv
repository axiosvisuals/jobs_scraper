We serve as the population health strategist, and policy, and planning authority for the City of New York, while also having a vast impact on national and international public policy, including programs and services focused on food and nutrition, anti-tobacco support, chronic disease prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, family and child health, environmental health, mental health, and racial and social justice work, among others.
  

  

Our Agency’s five strategic priorities, building off a recently-completed strategic planning process emerging from the COVID-19 emergency, are:

In 2021, the NYC Board of Health declared racism as a public health crisis.

**Salary Range:****$69,000.00 – $79,000.00****Job Description**
-------------------


The Agency You’ll Join:
  

  

November 2022, New York City voters overwhelmingly approved three ballot proposals that put racial equity and justice at the heart of city government, including a new Commission on Racial Equity (CORE).
  

  

The first of its kind in the nation, the new Commission on Racial Equity is a new independent 15-member commission responsible for engaging diverse communities to advance racial equity in government operations and increase community voice in government decision making. CORE provides accountability for New Yorkers, regularly evaluating the City’s progress on its racial equity plan, requirements, and goals. CORE will be composed of diverse New Yorkers with equity expertise and/or relevant lived experience, serving as a conduit to bring historically excluded communities and voices into government decision-making.
  

  

The Team You’ll Work With:  

  

CORE is an independent commission composed of 15 commissioners, including one Chair & Executive Director, jointly appointed by the Mayor and New York City Council Speaker. Other CORE commissioners will be appointed by the Mayor, City Council Speaker, City Comptroller, and Public Advocate. City officials appointing commissioners to CORE are required to consider individuals that represent or have advocated for historically excluded voices, including people with lived experience of marginalization and individuals who have never served on a government board or commission before.
  

  

Commission on Racial Equity staff are responsible for executing the day-to-day mission and establishing its path to success. They will take the vision of the Chair & Executive Director and the Commissioners and translate it into action strategies and plans that implement accountability for racial equity in the city. Like the Commission itself, the Commission’s staff aims to be representative of New Yorkers from all communities and walks of life. Staff will bring an accountability mindset into their work, ensuring that they are collaborating with city agencies and voicing public concerns.
  

  

The Problems You’ll Solve
  

  

The Commission on Racial Equity seeks a Community Organizing and Engagement Associate who will focus on increasing youth voice in the mission, vision, and execution of the Commissions work. Reporting directly to the Director of Community Organizing, and Engagement, you will play a pivotal role in ensuring that young people between the ages of 11 and 25 years old participate in identifying community concerns, proposing ideas and solutions to enact change in government decision making.  

  

You will support the design and implementation of the Commission's youth focused proactive communications, digital communications, web presence, and more. As a Youth Voice Associate, you will manage the Commission’s presence and representation at community events, and engagements. In the first year, you will support the Community Organizing & Engagement Director in producing a public document outlining principles and best practices for government agencies to increase youth voice and power in their decision-making processes along with developing up to two trainings to build upon the consciousness of skills of NYC youth leaders to strengthen the pillars of racial equity in democracy. Candidates should be aware that occasional evening/ weekend work may be required for events or meetings.  

  

RESPONSIBILITIES
  

  

* Supports the development and implementation of CORE overall strategy for community organizing and engagement strategy, elevating the voices of New Yorkers between the ages of 11 and 25.
* Support youth voice, agency, and leadership in shaping CORE initiatives by organizing trainings, meetings, and other opportunities.
* Supports the communications team so that all Commission communications speak to Youth concerns and adheres to principles of access design, including plain language and language justice.
* As needed, works with the operations team to identify any vendors that are needed to assist with youth organizing and engagement activities and manages the collaboration with the vendors.
* Identifies appropriate locations and best partners for community organizing and engagement activities.
* Develops youth specific community organizing and engagement activities and identifies mechanism to capture community concerns and input.
* Works with the Director to identify the best way to engage and prepare Commissioners to work with, and integrate Youth voice, concerns, and solutions in their decision making.
* Co-develops trainings, facilitate workshops, and develops learning spaces that increase Young people’s knowledge on power structures, decision making, and racial equity.
* Engages community members on a range of issues raised.
* Embeds DEI and anti-racism practices and tools into the everyday functioning of the Commission.


  

About You
  

  

* Bachelor’s degree in communications, Public Relations, Journalism, or related field.
* 2-3 years of relevant professional experience in communications, public relations, or media relations is preferred.
* Strong written and verbal communication skills, with a penchant for plain language.
* Experience managing social media channels for an organization/brand (LinkedIn, X, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Medium).
* Ability to work independently and collaboratively in a fast-paced environment.
* Proven track record of managing and executing work streams toward completion.
* Strong organizational skills and attention to detail.
* Commitment to advancing racial equity and social justice and demonstrated commitment to diversity, inclusion, equity, and accessibility.
* Demonstrated commitment, competency and strong familiarity with issues affecting Black, Indigenous, Latinx, Asian, Middle Eastern and North African, or Pacific Islander communities in New York City, or other marginalized groups.
* An understanding of power, privilege, and oppression and how that shapes narrative.
* Excellent time management skills and experience working in a deadline-driven environment.
* Experience in community engagement, community organizing and serving in an accountability or oversight body is a plus.
* Bilingual (written and verbal) in Spanish or one of the following: Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Urdu, Hindi is a plus.

ACS manages community-based supports and foster care services, and provides subsidized child care vouchers. ACS child protection staff respond to allegations of child maltreatment. In juvenile justice, ACS oversees detention, placement and programs for youth in the community.
  

  

The ACS Division of Financial Services (DFS) is responsible for supporting, planning, implementing, and monitoring the fiscal functions of the agency in accordance with City, State and Federal guidelines. The work of DFS includes managing the ACS budget; submission of monthly claims for revenue; processing of payments to provider agencies and vendors; monitoring the financial health of provider agencies through financial review and audits; maintenance of the ACS bank accounts; centralized oversight of ACS Child Welfare financial eligibility; and data maintenance for financial systems of record.  

  

The Child Care Voucher Payment Unit (VPU) is responsible for processing approximately 8,100 childcare voucher payments each month for up to 76,000 children from infancy to age 13 and special needs children up to age 18 or 19 if in a vocational school.

Voucher payments are issued by a Payment Agent, YMS Management Associates Inc. (YMS), from invoices transmitted by VPU three times/week via a secure file transfer protocol. Payments are issued by direct deposit or loaded onto a payment card by YMS. Customer service is provided for payment queries from childcare providers.

VPU approvers will be required to review the resulting invoices for accuracy of entry and a large list of requirements which will increase the payment processing time exponentially. In addition, Approvers will mass process automated attendance entry and review CAPS Online for quality assurance and report any issues to developers to correct errors.

Starting Salary: $20 / hour and up



Citizens Bankers are the face of the branch. They devote their time getting to know their customers and building lasting relationships by providing trusted advice.


**What you'll do**



Are you outgoing? Do you get satisfaction out of helping others and offering sound advice? If you’re a “people person” who enjoys building positive relationships with customers, then this is the job for you!



Using your strong communication and problem-solving skills — along with your broad range of financial knowledge — you’ll provide recommendations and assist customers with financial solutions, supporting spending, saving, borrowing and investing needs.



You’ll get to know customers’ personal financial goals and recommend tailored solutions to help achieve them — like planning for the future, buying a home or opening a new credit card. You’ll introduce customers to digital and mobile-first ways to handle banking transactions, like on our app or through our ATMs. You’ll collaborate with partners in Wealth Management, Mortgage and Business Banking to help customers with more complex financial needs. You’ll make outbound calls to acquire new customers and schedule financial checkup appointments, as you understand what might be a good fit for a customer now, may not be 6 months from now. All financial policies and procedures will be followed, including proper cash handling, state and local laws and regulations.


**What you'll get**


* Meaningful work & relationships – You’ll help customers with important financial decisions that impact their lives like building a business, buying a house, paying for school or helping them realize their long-term financial goals. Colleagues and leadership listen to your ideas and feedback.
* Commitment to community – Give back with 4 hours of paid time off annually for volunteering, separate from regular PTO, and have your donations to eligible 501(c)(3) organizations matched, up to $1,000 annually.
* Career opportunities, reward, and upskilling – See your hard work rewarded with promotions and opportunities to grow your career through training, coaching, career planning and development resources that enable you to branch off in any direction your talents and interests take you.
* Exceptional benefits – Receive comprehensive health care coverage, including medical, dental and vision plans, a 401K with corporate match, tuition assistance, mental health and wellbeing programs, discounts on student loan refinancing, and more.


**Required Qualifications**


* High School degree or GED required

* Meet and comply with all requirements set forth in the SAFE Act, including, but not limited to successful completion of the pre-employment screening checks and obtaining a unique identifier from the NMLS.
* Completion of a video interview assessment as part of the application. **How to prepare:** Set aside 30-45 minute for the self-guided assessment that includes questions and games. Find a quiet place to record and be camera-ready. You’ll need a smartphone, tablet, or desktop computer with your camera and microphone enabled. You’ll answer questions, with 1 minute to prepare, 3 minutes to respond, and 1 opportunity to re-record. Share your skills and experience, and bring your personality to the interview. This step accelerates the interview process, allowing our recruiters to review your application and advise you of next steps quickly.
