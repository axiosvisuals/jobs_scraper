With the support of volunteer attorneys, the LCH team provides legal advice, advocacy, and representation to individuals and families in New York City who lack the security and stability of their own home, including by assisting with shelter access, public benefits, storage access and loss of personal belongings, and other challenges that New Yorkers face when they lack adequate shelter. LCH additionally advocates for system-wide policy and practice changes that can bring greater stability to those experiencing homelessness or seeking to leave or remain independent of the shelter system.

* As needed, provide general administrative support, including with new programming within LCH and across CBJC projects.

  

**EXPERIENCE, SKILLS, AND REQUIREMENTS*** Bachelor’s degree or substantially equivalent work experience in a professional setting.
* Minimum 6 months of work experience (relevant internships acceptable).

* Proficiency with Microsoft Office 365, and the ability to quickly learn and effectively use LegalServer and other technology.
