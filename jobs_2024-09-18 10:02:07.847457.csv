The Fund for Public Health in New York City (FPHNYC) is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that is dedicated to the advancement of the health and well-being of all New Yorkers. To this end, in partnership with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), FPHNYC incubates innovative public health initiatives implemented by DOHMH to advance community health throughout the city. It facilitates partnerships, often new and unconventional, between government and the private sector to develop, test, and launch new initiatives. These collaborations speed the execution of demonstration projects, effect expansion of successful pilot programs, and support rapid implementation to meet the public health needs of individuals, families, and communities across New York City.
  
  

PROGRAM OVERVIEW
  
DOHMH is committed to helping create a world where all New Yorkers can safely express their sexuality and gender identity with dignity, possessing the knowledge, skills, and resources to support healthy and fulfilling lives.
  
  

New York City Teens Connection (NYCTC) is an adolescent sexual health program of DOHMH, within the Bureau of Maternal, Infant and Reproductive Health (BMIRH), in the Division of Family and Child Health. By engaging youth, parents, community-based organizations, schools, clinics, and citywide government agencies in a comprehensive effort to improve adolescent sexual health, NYCTC will help youth in NYC learn about their sexual and reproductive health, access the information and resources they need to make healthy decisions and feel empowered to act on these decisions.
  
  

Poor health outcomes rarely occur in isolation, and specific communities face multiple health inequities. These unfair, unnecessary, and avoidable disparities are rooted in historical and contemporary injustices and discrimination – including racism – which require the investment of attention, resources, and deliberate corrective efforts to repair. As part of BMIRH, NYCTC strives to apply sexual and reproductive justice and racial justice frameworks that prioritize individual choice and bodily autonomy within historical events, lived experiences, sexualities, and social conditions, ensuring we fully engage community partners to move this work forward. NYCTC is also part of a larger health department effort to advance just and fair outcomes for all New Yorkers, particularly those historically most underserved and under-resourced. It prioritizes neighborhoods with histories of social disinvestment and persistently poor health outcomes.
  
  

NYCTC works through partnerships and existing systems to bring evidence-based sexual health education programs and clinic linkages to young people ages 11-20 across several priority neighborhoods with histories of social and economic disinvestment. NYCTC reaches young people with nine sexual health education programs across three settings – schools, clinics, and youth-serving organizations. Reducing the Risk, recommended by the NYC Department of Education (DOE), will be delivered in traditional high schools; Teen Health Project will be delivered in transfer and international high schools and select youth-serving organizations; Making Proud Choices will be delivered in middle schools, some high schools, and select youth-serving organizations; Positive Prevention Plus for Special Populations will be delivered in District 75 schools; Seventeen Days and Plan A will reach youth in clinics, schools, and youth-serving organizations, including foster care agencies and juvenile justice programs; and Sexual Health and Adolescent Risk Prevention will reach youth in a variety of youth-serving organizations. All partnering schools and youth-serving organizations will also be linked to local “teen-friendly” clinics that provide high-quality sexual and reproductive health services to young people, and instructors will incorporate a visit to the linked clinic. Parents of adolescents will be reached with the Linking Families and Teens curriculum through partnerships with school-based Parent Coordinators and various parent groups, being provided with education and support to improve their communication with youth around sexual and reproductive health. Building on existing relationships between DOHMH and community organizations, local leaders, and other stakeholders, NYCTC has established local Community Action Teams (CATs) and Youth Leadership Teams (YLTs) in 3 boroughs that inform the program work, encourage systems-based changes, and help disseminate information throughout the priority communities. Lastly, an evaluation plan that regularly monitors key processes and outcome measures for each component will provide the basis for continual improvements.
  
  

POSITION OVERVIEW
  
New York City Teens Connection (NYCTC) offers an exciting, unique opportunity for a public health professional to work on an innovative project to engage with youth-serving professionals, teens, parents, community leaders, clinical services providers, and other stakeholders who work with teens.

Shaker & Spoon is a small but innovative food business with an industrial kitchen/warehouse in Red Hook, Brooklyn. We produce monthly curated cocktail kits (think Blue Apron for craft cocktails) and ship them all over the country along with a variety of supporting products. Our small yet mighty team is focused on sustainably growing the company and creating unique, fun products that resonate with our customer community. We pride ourselves on running an ethical company that sources high-quality products from other small and medium-sized businesses, and treats people with dignity, care, and respect.

**Who are you?**

A detail-oriented, and self-motivated problem solver who wants an interesting, flexible gig in an environment with good vibes that will schedule you based on your availability. Good communication and organizational skills are a big plus. Ideally you’re a grounded team player, able to roll with the punches when things don't go as planned. Versatility and flexibility will definitely help—if you're able to wear different hats and to juggle various tasks with ease, you'll do well here.

**What will you be doing?**

You'll put together the components for our boxes (bottling, bagging, labeling, and sorting things) as well as cooking and bottling syrups. Then comes the kitting of all of those components, either into single-recipe smaller kits or multi-recipe boxes. This is usually done assembly-line style and you get one job and do it over and over again. The work is very rote and therefore rather zen, but there's usually another task around the corner so there's always variety, plus you get to listen to music and socialize with some great people.

Our website is shakerandspoon.com, in case you'd like to see what the product that you’d be helping put together looks like—subscription boxes of cocktail kits that include syrups, bitters, mixers, citrus, and the like. They're slightly different each month, but the concept stays the same.

We work in an industrial kitchen / warehouse space at 71 and 65 Commerce St, Brooklyn, NY 11231. Since we handle food, you'll have to maintain cleanliness, proper hygiene, and food safety rules. No food or warehouse experience necessary, we'll teach you, if you have the aptitude and willingness to learn!

**There's lots of standing and some lifting of heavier items, though always with safety top of mind. You'll need to be able to use your hands and wrists all day, often for repetitive motions, so please only apply if that won't cause you problems.**

StaffCo is a Professional Employer Organization, commonly referred to as a PEO, duly organized and registered under the New York Professional Employer Organization law. StaffCo and SUNY have entered into a professional employer agreement under which StaffCo is the employer of Stony Brook Clinical Practice Management Plan employees and responsible for all aspects of employment, including hirings, promotions, disciplines, terminations, the day-to-day direction and supervision of work, as well as labor relations and collective bargaining. StaffCo is fully responsible for providing all payroll and human resources services, including the payment of wages, collecting and reporting payroll taxes and maintaining any and all employee benefits. SUNY Stony Brook Hospital is responsible for the operation of the hospital and provision of health care and is the co-employer as is necessary to conduct its responsibilities and for related licensure, regulatory or statutory requirements and obligations.

  

Given StaffCo’s employment responsibilities, it is deemed the “employer” for employment and labor law purposes. Thus, the employees are private sector employees of StaffCo, not public sector employees of SUNY. The private sector nature of the StaffCo employees has been approved by NYS Civil Service and upheld in a decision by the US National Labor Relations Board.
