ABOUT US:

At Dig Food Group, we’re building a better food system for everyone by sourcing, cooking and serving delicious food everyday. Nine years in, we’ve grown to more than 30 fast-casual Dig restaurants, opened our first full-service restaurant, 232 Bleecker, partnered with 130 farms including our own Dig Acres, and taught thousands of people how to cook (really cook) in our kitchens.

To do this, we’ve built direct and real relationships with farmers. We don’t just name check them on our menus -- we’re true partners in their businesses. We focus on farmers who are independent, first-timers, women, immigrants, LGBTQ and people of color. These relationships allow us to get the best ingredients all year round and change our menu based on what is growing in the fields.

Each restaurant is run by a chef and all our food is cooked on site. There are no microwaves, can openers or freezers, just an entire culinary team at every location, cooking vegetables all day. This requires training a whole generation of chefs and cooks from the ground up, including many who have never worked in a restaurant before. Knife skills are life skills.

We’re not here to disrupt anything or become a platform. We run our business on good food and great people. From sourcing to serving, our mission is to create a better food system for everyone. That means a world where farmers can make a living growing food, anyone can learn to cook, and we can all eat well, together.

DIG believes in the power of a shared table to bring people together as we are committed to building a culturally inclusive team. Diverse candidates encouraged to apply

The duties of this position may change from time to time. DIG reserves the right to add or delete duties and responsibilities at the discretion of Dig or its managers. This job description is intended to describe the general level of work being performed. It is not intended to be all-inclusive.

True to our value of equity as a foundational element of all of our work, and a critical foundation to achieving population health impact in New York City, the NYC Health Department has been a leader in recognizing and dismantling racism's impacts on the health of New Yorkers and beyond. In 2021, the NYC Board of Health declared racism as a public health crisis.

In this role, you take responsibility for the complete ongoing care of each patient to ensure their dialysis treatment stays on track.

Our culture thrives on three promises: boldness is possibility, empathy is progress, and curiosity is momentum.  

At Edelman, we understand diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging (DEIB) transform our colleagues, our company, our clients, and our communities. We are in relentless pursuit of an equitable and inspiring workplace that is respectful of all, reflects and represents the world in which we live, and fosters trust, collaboration and belonging.  

Edelman is looking for an ACD to help us make things that culture will love. Our growing creative teams are the masterminds behind some of the world’s most talked about work. Whether we're teaming up with RZA to replace an outdated and racist ice cream jingle, fighting for intersectional environmental justice with TAZO Tea, or creating a hotel for the world's most devoted Taco Bell fans, the work we create is designed to capture attention and get people talking. It’s not enough to be culturally relevant—our briefs demand that we change culture around us. Now we need a strong ACD Copywriter who can help unlock more of those weird, wild ideas.  

What kind of creative work will you do? We’re glad you asked. Because our work doesn’t really fit inside any kind of standard PR/Advertising/Communications/Marketing box, there’s no “standard” creative brief here. We’re the kind of creative department that works on scripts for a heartfelt brand anthem in the morning, switches over around lunchtime to concepting for a brand stunt that’ll hijack culture, and end our day by workshopping funny tweets. And that’s just a Monday. So, if you’re looking to come up with ideas that go beyond the 30-second spot – the kind of ideas that end up in the pages of the New York Times and on the One Show shortlist – you’ll be in good company here.  

To land this gig, you need to have a passion for people and helping others solve problems. Our culture is what sets us apart from traditional ad agencies, and it’s why so many stay with us awhile. At Edelman, our most valuable resource is you – our people – with a diversity of backgrounds, ideas, and smarts (with heart). We support one another, encourage each other, and we’re looking for individuals who want to contribute to our culture.

JOB SUMMARY:


The Cooper Union’s Retraining Program for Immigrant Engineers (RPIE) is a free professional development opportunity that supports immigrant, refugee, and asylee engineers as they build a competitive portfolio to equip them for the professional workforce and the career they want.


RPIE fosters a supportive community and empowers participants to activate their past experience as they develop the required skills for today’s market. The Program has two primary components: a technical curriculum that allows participants to develop in-demand engineering skills, gain US experience, and prepare for certification exams; and a robust professional development sequence that encourages participants to build individually-tailored career strategies and strengthen the soft skills required for leading industries.


RPIE Career Coaches support participants one-on-one and in small groups as participants familiarize themselves with the US engineering sector and build agency in their job search. Career Coaches provide direct support to 30-35 participants per term (15-17 participants/week). Coaches will offer skills assessments, review career opportunities, teach soft skills, support goal setting, and provide career coaching to RPIE participants.


RPIE participants represent over forty nationalities and have backgrounds in over thirty engineering specializations, including Civil, Electrical, Mechanical, and Chemical engineering, as well as architecture, IT, and programming. All participants enter with at least an undergraduate degree, and 35% have an advanced degree. Over 60% of participants have substantial previous professional experience. RPIE is committed to supporting participants as they work to gain the professional skills and familiarity with the US workforce and job application process to enter industry positions with competitive salaries (an average of at least $70,000), benefits, and career growth opportunities.

* Coach participants one-on-one to identify career goals, support the development of their professional portfolio and network, and guide them through the stages of the RPIE program workbook

Our AI-powered platform was purpose-built for medical conversations, improving clinical documentation efficiencies while enabling clinicians to focus on what matters most—their patients.


Our enterprise-grade technology transforms patient-clinician conversations into structured clinical notes in real-time, with deep EMR integrations. Powered by Linked Evidence and our purpose-built, auditable AI, we are the only company that maps AI-generated summaries to ground truth, helping providers quickly trust and verify the output. As pioneers in generative AI for healthcare, we are setting the industry standards for the responsible deployment of AI across health systems.


We are a growing team of practicing MDs, AI scientists, PhDs, creatives, technologists, and engineers working together to empower people and make care make more sense.

**The Role**
------------


We’re looking for someone to lead the Information Technology function that enables our growing US-based team to develop, sell, and support our generative AI-powered products that bring joy back to the practice of medicine.

**What You'll Do**
------------------

* Oversee the procurement and provisioning of devices, including computers, mobile phones, and other hardware, ensuring they meet the company's standards for security and functionality.
* Manage the implementation and maintenance of Mobile Device Management (MDM) systems to ensure the security and compliance of company devices.
* Manage all aspects of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications, including user onboarding and offboarding, license management, and vendor relationships.
* Automate manual processes and improve efficiency wherever possible.
* Collaborate with cross-functional teams to identify, plan, and deliver the IT projects required to support our growth. This role may require occasional travel to set up and support US-based offices.
* Develop and implement IT policies and procedures to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and industry standards. You will be responsible for keeping complete, regularly updated, and accurate records.
* Build a service desk function to support team members needing hardware and software support.
* Provide leadership and guidance to ensure the security of our IT systems and data, including vulnerability management, incident response, and disaster recovery planning.

**What You’ll Bring**
---------------------

* 7+ years of experience in IT leadership roles, with a proven track record of success in managing complex IT environments. You have built an IT function at a fast-growing startup
* Experienced working in a regulated environment. You have implemented compliance frameworks such as SOC2 and HITRUST
* Experienced with endpoint management solutions for both Mac + Windows. We are primarily Mac-based, and you must have several years of experience supporting a fleet of Apple hardware. You probably have some strong opinions about tools like JAMF and Addigy
* Passionate about technology, with expertise in areas such as network infrastructure, cloud computing, cybersecurity, and IT service management
* A fantastic communicator who collaborates effectively with stakeholders at all levels of the organization
* Excited about being hands-on in a fast-moving, productive, and supportive environment
* Willing to pitch in wherever needed. As a fast-moving startup, we need to do good work quickly
* Relevant certifications (e.g., CISSP, CISM, ITIL) are a plus


We value people who want to learn new things, and we know that great team members might not perfectly match a job description. If you’re interested in the role but aren’t sure whether or not you’re a good fit, we’d still like to hear from you.

**Base Salary:** $170,000 - $235,000+ USD per year + Equity (DOE)


The salary range provided is based on transparent pay guidelines and is an estimate for candidates residing in the San Francisco and New York City metro areas. The actual base salary will vary depending on the candidate's location, relevant experience, skills, qualifications, and other job-related factors. Additionally, this role may include the opportunity to participate in a company stock option plan as part of the total compensation package.

**Must be willing to work from our SF or NYC office 2-3x/week**


Strong preference for candidates who are currently in the San Francisco Bay Area or the New York Tri-State area, or are willing to relocate to these areas. This position requires a commitment to a hybrid work model, with the expectation of coming into the office 2-3 times per week.

**Must be willing to travel up to 10%**


Abridge typically hosts a three-day builder team retreat every 3-6 months. These retreats often feature internal hackathons, collaborative project sessions, and social events that allow the team to connect in-person.

**Life at Abridge**
-------------------


At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.


Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

**Diversity & Inclusion**
-------------------------


Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

**Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud**
----------------------------------------------------------


We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process. Any emails from the Abridge recruiting team will come from an @abridge.com email address. You can learn more about how to protect yourself from these types of fraud by referring to this article.
