Litigation Supervisors are responsible for helping attorneys develop mastery in all aspects of litigation as well as in reinforcing and building upon skills and values introduced in initial and ongoing trainings. Litigation Supervisors write professional development reviews, periodically coordinate case practice and attorney workgroup meetings, and from time to time, develop practice materials useful for staff at CFR. Litigation Supervisors also work with family court staff and staff from other agencies, including ACS, to address substantive and operational issues that affect a large court-based practice.


The Litigation Supervisor will work with other Supervisors and Senior Staff as well as with the Director of Litigation, Director of Holistic Practice, Training Supervisor, Development & HR staff, and Executive Director to inform decisions on strategic planning and overall program development and improvement for the entire agency. In those areas, activities may include administration, hiring and recruitment, training, policy work, development, progressive discipline, fellowships, and appeals.

Who you are:
You’re a goal-getter who is passionate about the power of education. Over the past 3+ years, you’ve demonstrated success in outside business development, consultative sales or account management.
You know it’s not all about achieving (and often crushing!) your goals. While that does get you excited, what you really thrive on is using your exceptional communication and coaching skills to help non-traditional Grand Canyon University students’ level up in their lives through quality education.
Now is the time to bring your talent to Grand Canyon Education, where you’ll have the opportunity to play an integral role in providing Grand Canyon University students the roadmap for success from application through to completion of the first few classes.

You’ll shape high impact partnerships for your territory and execute your daily work through informational presentations, calls and emails, iterating as needed to maximize value.
* Partner and influencer. Through a variety of mediums, you will use your passion for serving others to provide exceptional counseling to prospective students, their families and partners. Whether in-person, over the phone or via email, you will champion the GCE mission, promoting Grand Canyon University student success and institutional growth.
* Heart and Hustle. This is a community-based role with ambitious targets! Working independently, you’ll be using your out-of-the-box critical thinking skills to support prospective Grand Canyon University students through the admissions process, guiding them on the right path towards a successful online learning experience.


The role might be right for you if you have:* A Bachelor’s degree preferred. No delinquent or in default on a federal student loan as verified in your credit report. If in a rehabilitation program, your credit report must reflect that you are current, not delinquent, on your payments.
* Outstanding time management skills. In this role, you’ll be wearing many hats, so you’ll need to show that not only have you honed your time management skills, you also know how to prioritize competing priorities even while travelling.
* Clear communication skills. You can explain just about anything to anyone and you’re comfortable communicating in person, in writing and on the phone. You’ll also need to have well developed listening skills.
* Self-motivation and drive to succeed. You volunteer for new challenges without waiting to be asked. You’re going to take ownership of the time you spend with Grand Canyon University students and truly make a difference.

As a part of **The Brandtech Group**, we're at the forefront of leveraging cutting-edge AI technology to revolutionise how we create and deliver work. Our **AI solutions** enhance efficiency, spark creativity, and drive insightful decision-making, empowering our teams to produce innovative and impactful results.

### **About the role:**



We are seeking a mid-to-senior level User Experience **(UX) Researcher** to join the Customer Marketplace Insights (CMI) team. You will help drive transformation and innovation by contributing insights and research outcomes that translate directly into business and product impacts. As a UX Researcher, you will be a core member of the team focused on business customers.

You have a critical approach to research. You're always looking for sources of bias. As appropriate, you challenge the use of research techniques, and suggest techniques better suited to a scenario. You understand when less-direct data gathering methods may be appropriate, e.g. observation vs interviewing when studying a business process. You have a healthy sense of ""some things are difficult to know through research"" and are quick to think about (and communicate to stakeholders) limitations to various research approaches.


### **What you will be doing:**


* Execute research activities (e.g. user interviews/testing/evaluation, field studies, journey mapping) to uncover experience and product development insights
* Produce research documents – screeners, question guides, reports, et cetera

* Manage the research participant experience, to ensure their comfort during research sessions, and protect their personal/private data.
* Collaborate with and manage stakeholders across various functions/disciplines, including industrial design and technology partners

### **What you need to be great in this role:**


* Bachelor's degree in a research-related discipline
* Five or more years of related non-academic work experience in a dedicated research role (we are not looking for someone who dabbles in research or has been research-adjacent in another function)
* Experience defining and planning the approach and methodologies in context of project scope and timeline.

* Experience crafting discussion guides and appropriate tools and exercises to reveal customer/user needs and desires
* Experience moderating and planning field studies, user interviews, and usability studies in in-person and remote testing environments.
* Experience with qualitative generative research, evaluative methodologies, and usability from concept formation through launch.
* You have at least a non-specialist understanding of quantitative research – you know the basics, and have a good sense of when to ask a specialist for help or look something up.
* Experience with secondary data, trends, and learnings.
* Experience demonstrating UX Research impact, including driving business and product decisions through UX Research.
* You have worked in close partnership with designers and business units.
* You are adept at managing stakeholders and understanding the orientations and needs of different business functions within a large organization.
* Experience with project management in cross-functional teams
* Experience working in an Agile environment.
* Detail-oriented approach and the ability to work fairly independently on a variety of tasks.
* Strong oral and written communication skills.
* Experience providing insights to inform physical product development decisions
