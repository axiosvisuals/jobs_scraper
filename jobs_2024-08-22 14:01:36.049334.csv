VOICE Charter School (http://www.voicecharterschool.org/) is an elementary and middle school located in Long Island City, Queens that serves about 650 students across grades K-8. We are located just minutes from Manhattan (two stops outside of Manhattan on the F, N, and W train lines) and Long Island City’s growing waterfront district, thriving arts community, and rapid residential growth. We are looking to identify extraordinary educators and administrators committed to urban education who wish to join a dynamic professional learning community.

Our mission is to create a safe and healthy learning environment that will nurture, motivate and challenge all of our children to achieve the highest level of academic excellence and to develop into mindful, responsible, contributing participants in their education, their community and the diverse society in which we live.

***What makes VOICE different?***

**At VOICE, it’s not just about the music. It’s about the people.** It’s about what you can be. It’s about using your passion. It’s about relationships. It’s about having the opportunity to choose. It’s about caring enough. It’s about each individual child and adult.

**We believe in efficacy.** At the core of our academic culture is the idea that all students are capable of doing well in any discipline. At VOICE, all students will learn – being smart is not something that you are, it is something you become. At VOICE, you will be pushed to become more.

**We support and develop the effectiveness of our teachers.** We believe that teachers need time to collaborate to build their practice, so we provide our team with over two hours of planning time a day as well as additional days for collaborative thought partnership and planning during the school year.

**We promote participation in music and the arts.** As music and art help develop problem solving and critical thinking skills and open children's imaginations, all VOICE students participate in and learn from daily activities in the arts including rigorous choral training.

RSS gives community members the opportunity to live their best, happiest and healthiest lives and operates with a $2.2MM operating budget serving between 3 – 5,000 community members each year.

Riverdale Senior Center originally opened with the mission of providing a place where people could meet friends, share a meal and learn from one another. As we have grown, we’ve responded to the changing needs and interests of the vital, diverse senior population in our geographic area. In addition to a daily delicious lunch, RSS now offers a full range of exercise, cultural, health management and social programs, as well as a wide array of social and behavioral health services.

Our focus is on creating effective and efficient design for the most important business, security, and compliance processes for our clients. We touch on aspects of application security and areas prone to fraud and financial misstatement and on streamlining processes that are part of our client’s core business so they can get a higher return on this key investment. Using innovative and proprietary technologies, we help to bridge the gap between business stakeholders, compliance functions, and Information Technology teams to assist in understanding how to embrace new ways of working while limiting their financial and operational risk profile. We use knowledge of financial system design, risk mitigation, business process design, data integrity, security, and data analytics. Our clients make large investments in enterprise systems, and they need to design those systems to meet the needs of their business while providing capabilities to improve end user experiences while managing risk. Our team helps companies manage risks on their journey to a more digitally integrated environment which enables them to better harness cloud technologies. As a part of our team, you will focus on helping clients gain value across their technology ecosystem by addressing risks tied to systems, security, data, reporting, and programs.  

To really stand out and make us fit for the future in a constantly changing world, each and every one of us at PwC needs to be a purpose-led and values-driven leader at every level. To help us achieve this we have the PwC Professional; our global leadership development framework. It gives us a single set of expectations across our lines, geographies and career paths, and provides transparency on the skills we need as individuals to be successful and progress in our careers, now and in the future.

Lead UX Designer - Capital One Software
Ever since our first credit card customer in 1994, Capital One has recognized that technology and data can enable even large companies to be innovative and personalized. As one of the first large enterprises to go all-in on the public cloud, Capital One needed to build cloud and data management tools that didn’t exist in the marketplace to enable us to operate at scale in the cloud. And in 2022, we publicly announced Capital One Software and brought our first B2B software solution, Slingshot, to market.


Building on Capital One’s pioneering adoption of modern cloud and data capabilities, Capital One Software is helping accelerate the data management journey at scale for businesses operating in the cloud. If you think of the kind of challenges that companies face – things like data publishing, data consumption, data governance, and infrastructure management – we’ve built tools to address these various needs along the way. Capital One Software will continue to explore where we can bring our solutions to market to help other businesses address these same needs going forward.


We are seeking top tier talent to join our pioneering team and propel us towards our destination. You will be joining a team of innovative product, tech, and design leaders that tirelessly seek to question the status quo. As a Capital One Lead UX Designer, you’ll have the opportunity to be on the forefront of building this business and bring these tools to market.
