To us, famous isn’t about standing out in the crowd. It’s about feeling good where you stand right now. Famous Footwear is your place for athletic, fashion and casual shoes for the whole family from hundreds of name brands.
  
  

As a Famous Footwear Sales Associate, you are passionate about providing the best shoe store experience for every customer.

Most importantly, you LOVE shoes and regardless of your style, you help every person who enters the store experience a little bit of that Famous Feeling.
  
  

What You’ll be Doing
  
  

* Ace Retail Operations: You’ll ensure daily store tasks (pricing, shipment processing, fulfillment and inventory) are dialed in, keeping the store running like a tightly laced sneaker. Utilizing our company standards as a framework for success, you’ll deliver on our goal of keeping the store clean, organized, and all our famous styles easily shoppable.
* Be a Famous Culture Influencer: Champion our Famous culture with pride by embodying the behaviors that power our Customer Connection.

Maintain a positive and proactive mindset, even in the face of challenges, you’re the type of person to uplift and support others. To help others be their best, you’ll help your teammates be their best selves by assisting with training and development when needed.

The following beliefs are essential commitments for our staff team:


* We believe that within each of us is a desire to move towards health and achievement, under the right conditions. It is our job to provide young people with those conditions.
* We believe that every young person wants to love and be loved. It is our job to love these young people, and to help them learn to love themselves and others.
* We believe in the power of belonging. It is a core human condition to want to be missed when we are gone. We will miss young people when they are absent, and we will express that: “We didn’t see you yesterday. We missed you. We are glad you are back”. We will make sure every young person belongs in our community. No matter what. “She drew a circle to shut me out. Heretic, rebel, a thing to flout. But love and I had the wit to win. We drew a circle that took her in” (Edwin Markham)
* We accept young people for who they are. Right here. Right now. They do not have to change to be respected and loved and valued and be a member of our community. Behavior is not a condition of their worth as human beings.
* We believe that every young person wants to be in charge of their own life. To that end, we will give young people a voice in this program, and choices of how to best accomplish their goals.
* We are hungry to understand if our interventions are having the intended impact. We will be meticulous in our data entry, and ruthless in our hunt to understand the data and learn from it. If what we are doing is not working, we will set aside our egos, intentions and preconceived notions and we will change what we are doing.
* We believe that the young people with whom we work deserve our full attention and our best selves. Therefore, we will: NOT allow our personal beliefs or baggage to interfere with our work; we will commit to doing excellent work all the time on behalf of our young people; we will be honest and transparent with ourselves, our colleagues and our partners. To be very clear, by working in this program we are committing to:
	+ Engaging in self-care outside of work so that our personal issues don’t interfere with our ability to focus on our young people.
	+ Open communication - Bringing all issues directly back to the person OR to the group session in a way that fosters a healthy team.
	+ Learning our craft before practicing on our youth.
	+ Giving and receiving honest feedback, even if it is uncomfortable to hear or say","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Domus-Kids","http://www.domuskids.org","Stamford","51 to 200","$5M to $25M (USD)","","","","",""

There are over 30M small businesses in the United States, but only a tiny fraction of them have a workplace savings program in place. As the savings gap in the country widens, it's imperative that every worker has access to and participates in their company's savings program, such as a 401(k) or 403(b). We believe that American workers should have easy access to an inexpensive, flexible, and intuitive solution to save for a brighter future.  

  

Unfortunately, prior to Vestwell, small businesses have been neglected and underserved, with expensive, inflexible, poorly designed offerings built on old, mainframe software. Vestwell is changing that, starting with rebuilding the core infrastructure for the modern era.  

  

Vestwell's north star is to be the engine behind a $30T industry, powering all payroll-deducted workplace savings programs for small-to-midsize businesses, such as 401(k), 403(b), IRA, emergency savings accounts (ESA), health savings accounts (HSA), 529 college savings, and alike.  

  

Vestwell's focus is to build the most flexible, powerful workplace savings and investment platform, delivered through the hands and minds of their financial services partners with the help of payroll provider partners. The team at Vestwell makes the hard stuff look easy, by combining the expertise of financial advice with the sophistication of a technology provider.  

  

As a result, workplace providers are able to bestow the advice and solution employers and employees have been asking for, while growing and scaling along the way. Employers get a cost-effective solution designed for their needs without all the headaches, and employees get a user-friendly portal that helps them achieve their long-term saving goals.


**WHY VESTWELL?**



With backing from leading FinTech investors, as well as a growing team of dedicated professionals of strong industry pedigree, Vestwell is at the forefront of a much-needed change in a 40-year old industry. Our team believes in the mission we've set out to achieve and we are working hard to get there. We're ambitious, honest, thoughtful, and fun.



**Who are we looking for?**

  


Vestwell is expanding and we're excited about growing our Operations team with entry-level Payroll Operations Coordinators who are passionate about our mission to change the retirement Fin-Tech space. At a high level, we're looking for someone who has insane levels of attention to detail and proven ability of juggling multiple priorities at once. You will be key to powering transactions on the platform and ensuring it runs at full speed.



We're a startup… so an enthusiastic self-starter mentality comes first and foremost. You are someone who will dive into whatever challenge is placed in front of you and find creative ways to solve problems.


**What will you be doing?**



A key component of Vestwell's mission to empower retirement savings includes effortless plan onboarding and ongoing plan administration. As a Payroll Operations Coordinator you will help monitor and support these processes to ensure that sponsors can provide a 401(k) plan with as little friction as possible to help their employees save for retirement.


**Day-to-day you will also be expected to:**


* Maintain existing knowledge bases and update accordingly
* Assist Operations Associates and Senior Operations leaders Identify and resolve discrepancies in payroll, deferrals, eligibility, and other related activities, to ensure our data is consistent and accurate.
* Help with the auditing of recordkeeping operations and plan administration components.
* Timely completion of assigned tickets and team projects.
* Meet SLAs and productivity goals.
* Escalating and assisting in investigating and reconciling discrepancies in data and remediating accordingly.
* Strong written communication, critical thinking and organizational skills


**Requirements**

  

*The Necessities*


* Excel proficiency
* Comfort working in a start-up environment with a substantial degree of autonomy and flexibility

* Ability to manage time effectively, set priorities, and meet deadlines
* Excellent verbal and written communication skills


*The Extras*


* Proficiency with productivity tools, especially JIRA
* Familiarity with payroll systems and payroll processing
* Knowledge of data structures and navigating databases


The expected salary range for this position is $50K - $55K. Please note that salary bands are based on NY and other similar metro areas and may differ based on where the role is ultimately hired.

**OUR BENEFITS**



We're a growth stage startup with lots of exciting milestones ahead. We value health and wellness at Vestwell and in addition to a dedicated Employee Wellbeing Committee, we offer competitive health coverage and an open vacation policy. We have adopted a remote-hybrid office policy, but all employees are welcome at our bright, comfortable office with many workspace options in midtown Manhattan so everyone has a setting that is the most productive for them. We provide our team with all the equipment they need (plus a few perks!) to work effectively remotely. Oh, and naturally we have a great 401(k) plan!


**OUR PROCESS**  

  

It starts the same for every candidate: getting to know the team members through 1 - 2 conversations about Vestwell, your experience, and your interests. Next steps can vary by role, but the usual next steps are a skill or experience screen (e.g. a coding interview for an Engineer, a portfolio review for a Designer, deeper experience call for other roles) which leads to a virtual or in-person interview panel after that if the screens go well. *Before making an offer, our interview process concludes with a references check stage for your recruiter to meet with a current or former supervisor and peer.* We prioritize transparency and lack of surprise throughout the process.

Are you looking for a job where you can use your experience to propel your career into management? At New York Life, we will invest in you from the start to help you learn and grow as a financial professional first. We’ll train you in valuable skills, such as marketing, business development, and customer relationship management, and provide you with the tools you need to further your career. Then we’ll train you and provide you with access to the tools you need for a career in management.

**What we’re looking for**

We’re looking for people who want to make a lasting impact on the financial well-being of individuals, families, and small businesses—motivated people who can answer yes to one of the following questions:

* Do you have sales or managerial experience in another industry?
* Have you previously run your own business?
* Do you have an MBA or other equivalent degree?

In the Accelerated Path to Management Program, you’ll start off as a financial professional, learning how to sell our products, building client relationships, and meeting specific requirements1 before transitioning into a management role.

You’ll then undergo a six-month intensive training program designed to prime you for success as a manager. You will use that experience to understand how to recruit and coach others to success.

**What we offer**

**Your first year**

You’ll learn firsthand about a financial professional’s role and day-to-day work by working as a financial professional for the first year of your career journey with New York Life. We will provide you with complete training, access to digital tools, and a comprehensive product suite.

**Training and resources**

You will receive top-notch training that will give you an understanding and appreciation for the strength and value of New York Life. Beyond this training and support, New York Life will provide access to the resources you need to succeed day-to-day, including experts on hand to answer your questions and a suite of digital sales, prospecting and marketing tools that will help you attract and retain your clients with web, social and email content.

**Product Solutions**

You will learn about our robust products and services that can help clients achieve their financial goals. Together with its subsidiaries, New York Life provides a range of competitive insurance and financial products, including life insurance, annuities, long-term care insurance, disability income insurance, and investment products such as mutual funds through our broker-dealer, NYLIFE Securities LLC (member of FINRA and SIPC), a Licensed Insurance Agency. You will be required to hold securities licenses and FINRA registrations and affiliate with NYLIFE Securities as a registered representative before you can offer investment products.

**Your transition to a Field Manager role**

After meeting specific requirements for the first 12 months as a financial professional, you will enter a specialized six-month Associate Partner training program.1 We’ll help you to lead and build your team of financial professionals. Throughout your career journey with New York Life, you’ll continue to have opportunities to grow and be promoted to increasingly senior levels of management.

**How we will compensate you**

When you begin with New York Life as a financial professional2, you will receive income that is commission-based.3

If you meet the requirements and approvals to become an Associate Partner, you will receive a salary. The salary range for an Associate Partner is $60,000–$150,000 (in California and Washington, the minimum salary is $64,480 and $65,479, respectively), plus you will be eligible for certain bonuses and other incentives based on the performance of agents in your unit, including additional compensation related to the agents you recruit and develop (“R&Ds”). R&Ds are additional compensation that is designed to increase your income and to reimburse for any reasonable and necessary expenses we do not otherwise reimburse. You will also be eligible for medical, dental, and vision benefits, life, long-term disability, and accidental death and dismemberment coverages, a pension plan,4 and a 401(k) savings plan.5

New York Life will value and reward your hard work and success. You’ll have significant income potential over time, because our field managers’ compensation is directly aligned with their recruiting performance and the production level of their team of financial professionals. The average income among our 579 recruiters at all levels in 2022 was $240,000.6

At Charles Tyrwhitt our purpose is to “Make it easy for men to dress well” and we can’t do that without our specialist teams.


At this time, we’re on the lookout for a Part Time, Sales Associate who will be working with Bernadette from our World Trade Center store.


This store is located in the Westfield World Trade Center!

 **What we are looking for**


We are looking for a confident Sales Associate who can connect with our customers, deliver excellence in customer experience, and offer advice on current trends relevant to our clientele. Previous experience in a similar position is a huge advantage to this role. Training is provided to help you understand our brand.

 **What you can expect from us**


CT is a privately-owned business, so we're not a big corporate-style place to work. Our senior leaders are transparent and approachable, and we welcome ideas to make this a great place to work. We value our people whilst being product and customer obsessed.

  

* Quarterly bonus based on team sales performance
* Part-time paid time off!
* Uniform allowance
* PayActiv partnership- get wages already earned before payday!
* Employee discount
* Other leave and Time off policies
* Employee Assistance Program- Free Therapy!

 **Who we are**


Once upon a shirt, Nicholas Charles Tyrwhitt Wheeler had the notion that he could make a better shirt at better value than anyone else in the world! He believed that all men; no matter their shape or size, where they may be in the world or indeed their budget; should be able to own a Jermyn Street quality shirt. A proper shirt. A CT shirt.


That was over 3 decades ago and whilst Charles Tyrwhitt (it rhymes with spirit by the way) is still famous for proper shirts, these days we are about so much more than collars and cuffs. Our purpose is to “make it easy for men to dress well”. We take care of the entire wardrobe, providing stylish solutions for every occasion. We make sure he gets what he wants, when and how he wants it.


Charles Tyrwhitt’s spiritual home and flagship store is located on London’s Jermyn Street, in the United Kingdom where our presence is well know. We also have a strong online presence in the US, with retail stores in 7 states and a New York head office. We also operate across Europe and Australia! Pretty impressive, eh? And as of 2022, we're proud to be recognized as a carbon-neutral retailer as we continue our journey to be a sustainable business.

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/U--haul","http://www.uhaul.com/","2727 North Central Avenue

* Establish and maintain relationships, at decision-making levels, with key sponsors and borrowers across the U.S., Latin America and Australasia.
* Establish and maintain relationships with financial intermediaries such as bank agents and (debt) advisors to facilitate deal flow.

* Promote MIM in general and its private capital business by participating in industry conferences, seminars and networking events for institutional investors and for issuers.
