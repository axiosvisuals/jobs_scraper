The Vera Institute of Justice is powered by hundreds of advocates, researchers, and policy experts working to transform the criminal legal and immigration systems until they're fair for all. Founded in 1961 to advocate for alternatives to money bail in New York City, Vera is now a national organization that partners with impacted communities and government leaders for change. We develop just, antiracist solutions so that money doesn't determine freedom; fewer people are in jails, prisons, and immigration detention; and everyone is treated with dignity. For more information, visit vera.org.



Vera has a staff of 224 people, is headquartered in Brooklyn, New York and has offices in Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, and New Orleans. We are an equal opportunity employer with a commitment to diversity in the workplace.

You have an extensive and nuanced understanding of the criminal and immigration legal systems, the workings of state and local policy, and demonstrated experience in leading campaigns to win policy change. You believe in the value of doing ""inside"" lane work to build champions for our issues within government, and in an ""outside"" lane approach of working in partnership with advocates, organizers, and grassroots and grasstops allies.


### **What qualifications are we looking for?**

**Team Building, Mentorship, and Supervision**


* Oversee and own the overall supervision and development of direct and indirect staff reports, including professional development, goal setting, advancement, and elements of accountability, aligned with Vera's commitment to anti-racism and REI efforts

* Curiosity and willingness to research, read, talk to people, and learn constantly about New York's dynamic and evolving criminal justice field, with an ability to translate that knowledge into strategic implementation and changes to policy and practice
* Firsthand and extensive experience with New York's criminal justice system—as an advocate, practitioner, policymaker, lawyer, researcher, or someone who is directly impacted

* Expertise creating advocacy strategies from idea to infrastructure to implementation – including grassroots organizing and coalition building
* Demonstrated ability to produce excellent writing in a variety of settings, from longer reports, briefing memos, to media opinions and editorials.


**Preferred**:

Imagen Technologies is a high-growth healthcare startup enabling patients to be diagnosed, treated, and managed at their primary care appointment (vs. having to refer out to hospitals, imaging centers, and other slow and expensive options). Today, we've built an AI-enabled platform that enables patients to receive immediate diagnostic tests, immediate results, and immediate next steps – all in a single Primary Care appointment. For example: through our platform, women across the U.S. are now receiving comprehensive breast imaging, results, and specialist-driven next steps at their local Primary Care office, condensing a multi-month diagnostic journey into 60 minutes.



With over $160m in funding from Google Ventures and some of the largest clinical networks in the country, we are rapidly expanding this platform across the U.S. - from 16 states and 500,000 patients in 2023 to 20+ states and 1.5M patients in 2024.

This stance accounts for a good working environment at Miele and the success of our products.



Our colleagues can rest assured that those who live up to our standards of quality and professionalism grow personally and professionally. No matter if they are at entry levels or managers.



Miele asks a lot of its employees. They are expected to develop and manufacture worldwide market premium products that are ""Immer Besser"". In return, they receive the most valuable thing Miele can give them: that they themselves become ""Immer Besser"" - in all of their professional and personal abilities.



""Immer Besser"" is therefore an entrepreneurial success principle from which customers and employees benefit in equal measure. We call this principle ""MAKE IT BETTER. BE BETTER"".
