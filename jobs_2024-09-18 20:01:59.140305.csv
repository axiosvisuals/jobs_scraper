In addition to the Indeed submission, applicants are required to complete the Wonderlic assessment, which can be accessed at the link below. Applicants who do not complete this step will not be considered.

https://apply.select.wonderlic.com/A7DEY2/Bitro-Group-Inc

The Wonderlic is used by many employers, including Fortune 500 companies. It has proven to be a very key predictor of fit in our hiring process, so it is an important factor (one of many) that we consider in reviewing applications.

There are three sections to the assessment. The first is cognitive and the final two are questions about yourself. For the cognitive section, try to complete as many as you can without getting stuck too long on any one question (you may use scrap paper to help work them out if needed). The final two sections are survey questions about yourself. It's important to answer as honestly as possible as these sections help us learn more about you. For best results, make sure you complete it in an environment where you can concentrate.

It all started with one big dream, two crazy cousins, and the perfect combination of flour, sugar, and chocolate chips. Crumbl was co-founded by Jason McGowan (CEO) & Sawyer Hemsley (COO). They both teamed up and dove head-first into the world of baking. After thousands of dollars in wasted dough, recipes that did not live up to their expectations, and cookies that are just plain embarrassing to them today, the two cousins decided to take their 'perfect cookie quest' to the people. They gathered feedback and tested recipes — a practice that is still part of the Crumbl process — until they created the world’s best chocolate chip cookie.

It all started with one big dream, two crazy cousins, and the perfect combination of flour, sugar, and chocolate chips. Crumbl was co-founded by Jason McGowan (CEO) & Sawyer Hemsley (COO). They both teamed up and dove head-first into the world of baking. After thousands of dollars in wasted dough, recipes that did not live up to their expectations, and cookies that are just plain embarrassing to them today, the two cousins decided to take their 'perfect cookie quest' to the people. They gathered feedback and tested recipes — a practice that is still part of the Crumbl process — until they created the world’s best chocolate chip cookie.

We’re a private, multi-disciplinary clinic in White Plains, NY

To provide excellent patient care and training we must expand the scope and skills of the healthcare providers through training, teaching and research, hiring through rigorous development and implementation of systems and structures, policies and procedures that are framed by high quality norms and international standards.Additionally, VHW has established the Kigutu International Academy, a grade 9-12 boarding school to equip young minds with an education based on critical thinking to prepare them to become the leaders we wish their country and the continent to have for a better future.Our core values are as follows:
