The Center for Justice Innovation (formerly the Center for Court Innovation) is a non-profit organization that works with communities and justice systems to advance equity, increase safety, and help individuals and communities thrive. The Center's goal is to identify and resolve as early as possible the challenges that bring people into the criminal and civil legal systems. It does this in a number of ways—by developing and running programs that reduce the need for incarceration and enhance economic opportunity, conducting original research to identify what works, and sharing what we learn from our programming and research with those seeking to transform the justice system around the world.


The Center is an 800-employee, $100 million nonprofit that accomplishes its vision through three pillars of work: creating and scaling operating programs to test new ideas and solve problems, performing original research to determine what works (and what doesn’t), and providing expert assistance and policy guidance to justice reformers around the world.

**Operating Programs**


The Center’s operating programs, including the award-winning Red Hook Community Justice Center and Midtown Community Justice Center, test new ideas, solve difficult problems, and attempt to achieve systemic change within the justice system. Our projects include community-based violence prevention programs, alternatives to incarceration, reentry initiatives, and court-based initiatives that reduce the use of unnecessary incarceration and promote positive individual and family change. Through this programming, we have produced tangible results like safer streets, reduced incarceration, and improved neighborhood perceptions of justice.

**Research**


The Center's research teams are staffed with social scientists, data analysts, and lawyers who are academically-trained or have lived experience and who conduct research in the U.S. and globally on diverse criminal-legal system and justice issues. Their work includes evaluating programs and policies; conducting exploratory, community-based studies; and providing research translation and strategic planning for system actors. The Center has published studies on topics including court and jail reform, intimate partner violence, restorative justice, gun violence, reentry, sixth amendment rights, and progressive prosecution. The research teams strive to make their work meaningful and actionable to the communities they work with, policymakers, and practitioners.

**Policy & Expert Assistance**


The Center provides hands-on, planning and implementation assistance to a wide range of jurisdictions in areas of reform such as problem-solving courts (e.g., community courts, treatment courts, domestic violence courts), tribal justice, reducing incarceration and the use of fines/fees and reducing crime and violence. Our current expert assistance takes many forms, including help with analyzing data, strategic planning and consultation, policy guidance, and hosting site visits to its operating programs in the New York City area.

**Center Support**  

A dedicated support team within the Center ensures the smooth functioning of operations across various domains, including finance, legal, technology, human resources, fundraising, real estate, and communications. Comprising 15% of the organization's staff, these teams provide essential infrastructure support and innovative solutions aligned with the Center's mission and values.

**THE OPPORTUNITY**


Launched in 1993, the award-winning Midtown Community Justice Center is one of the country’s first problem-solving courts. It provides alternatives to fines and jail as a response to low-level crime. Seeking to reduce crime and incarceration, and increase public trust in justice, the Midtown Community Justice Center works with neighborhood stakeholders to improve Midtown Manhattan, and to serve the vibrant Midtown community, specifically those in need of services. The Justice Center’s court responds creatively to low-level offending, seeking sentences that are restorative to the defendant and community. In 2023, Midtown Community Justice Center celebrated 30 years of operation and was renamed to Midtown Community Justice Center to reflect the work we do in the community. The work has continued to move upstream and beyond the walls of our physical space through expanded diversion initiatives, street outreach, and community engagement.

Sunstone Credit is a financial technology company working to help businesses go solar.  

Solar in the United States is an exciting, accelerating industry. In 2021, over half of all new electricity-generating capacity was solar. Homeowners and really large businesses are increasingly installing solar, but we need to make it easier for small and medium sized businesses to do the same.  

Sunstone Credit is working to grow this significantly underserved segment in the solar industry by offering financing solutions that democratize access to renewable energy solutions for businesses. With unique capital and proprietary technology, Sunstone provides simple and efficient financing that solar installers use to help businesses acquire and deploy their solar system.  

We partner with best-in-class renewable energy developers across the country and help them grow and develop new customers and markets. By providing solar loans to businesses, we help these companies control their energy costs, contribute to meeting climate goals and ensure our entire economy is benefiting from clean, distributed electricity generation.

 **About the Role**  

Sunstone is seeking a Credit Associate to join our team. As a Credit Associate you will be responsible for evaluating renewable energy finance opportunities for commercial borrowers. The analysis will include a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the borrower as well as the renewable energy benefits of the solar system. Your evaluation will be detailed oriented, evidence based, and well documented. As a credit associate you will need excellent written, interpersonal, and excel based analytical skills. You will work very closely with our customers who are both the owners and installers of solar projects. As part of a startup, you will not work in a silo. You will go above and beyond your job description to help us meet our goals and you will have the opportunity to improve our processes, develop our standards, and collaborate on the development of our tech platform.  

  

**Why Sunstone**  

At Sunstone you will be part of a growing pioneer in climate tech and your work will have a positive impact on our world. You will be part of building a transformational business and work in a vibrant and fast paced start up culture.
