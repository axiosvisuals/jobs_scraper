Our mission is to contribute to the overall wellness and development of society, and to provide quality social and educational services to families in our community.

**Vision**

The Reggio Emilia Montessori Center (REMC) is a learning community committed to supporting the development of young children. Our early childhood center employs a whole child approach to ensure that each student is engaged and challenged in a safe, stimulating, and supportive environment that promotes creativity, critical thinking, and kindness and respect for others. We are passionate about creating access to quality social services and reducing economic inequality in urban areas.

We are expanding our work in the South Bronx! We currently work with community members through the Bronx H.Y.P.E Family Enrichment Center. Family Enrichment Centers (FECs) are warm and welcoming community gathering places where any family or individual can come for support, information, and to participate in and/or lead activities (called “offerings”). FECs are based on the premise that community members design and drive the FEC’s activities or offerings. We are excited to further our mission through the implementation of the School-Based Early Support model in South Bronx public schools.

The Division of Prevention Services (DPS) in the New York City Administration for Children’s Services (ACS) is renaming and redesigning the programs formerly known as ACS Beacon Prevention. Through the redesign, ACS intends to offer families a menu of flexible service options that strive to connect families to community resources through case management, address families’ concrete needs, support parents/caregivers, and avoid unnecessary investigations. The Reggio Emilia Montessori Center will implement this model in public schools located in School Districts 7 and 12.

**Position Description: Associate Vice President (AVP) for Community Programs**

The Reggio Emilia Montessori Center is growing its leadership team and looking for like-minded individuals to join in our expansion. The Executive Leadership Team consists of the Executive Director, Associate Vice President for Community Programs, and HR and Finance Lead. The Associate Vice President for Community Programs oversees the general management of all community based programs, with a focus on supervisor coaching and support, culture, and program implementation and quality. The AVP for Community Programs will contribute to the overall strategy of the organization, represent the organization at external meetings, develop a deep understanding of programs, cultivate program leadership, and ensure workplace culture is positive. This role requires someone who is adept at problem solving, using strengths-based leadership approaches to develop teams, and understands the importance of data-driven decision making. The AVP for Community Programs is eligible for promotion to Vice President after three consecutive years of high performance in the AVP role. The Associate Vice President for Community Programs reports directly to the Executive Director.

Heartbeat is the full-service agency for healthcare Challenger Brands. So what? So… Challengers are playing a high-stakes game—they must battle behemoth market leaders, upend ingrained treatment habits, or transform a ""me-too"" product into ""yes-please"" product.

FECs are based on the premise that community members design and drive the FEC’s activities or offerings. We are excited to further our mission through the implementation of the School-Based Early Support model in South Bronx public schools.

The Division of Prevention Services (DPS) in the New York City Administration for Children’s Services (ACS) is renaming and redesigning the programs formerly known as ACS Beacon Prevention. Through the redesign, ACS intends to offer families a menu of flexible service options that strive to connect families to community resources through case management, address families’ concrete needs, support parents/caregivers, and avoid unnecessary investigations. The Reggio Emilia Montessori Center will implement this model in public schools located in School Districts 7 and 12.

POSITION DESCRIPTION:

This position will be within the Division of Statewide Services and report to the Preadmission Screening and Resident Review (PASRR) Supervisor within Central Office and function as part of the Bureau of Nursing and Health Services.

The Registered Nurse 2-Community will work as part of a team to complete Preadmission Screening and Resident Review. The PASRR process is intended to prevent the inappropriate admission of persons with mental illness, intellectual disabilities, or developmental disabilities into nursing homes.

PASRR requirements were first enacted with the Nursing Home Reform Act as part of OBRA 1987. Federal law requires hospitals to conduct a Level I screen on all persons, with limited exceptions, who are seeking admission to nursing facilities to determine whether they have a mental disability.

If the nursing facility services applicant appears to have a disability, the hospital must ensure that OPWDD has referral information to complete a PASRR assessment. OPWDD will review all information provided and assure that type of care needed, cannot be provided within the spectrum of OPWDD supports, meeting the obligation to secure the least restrictive placement for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD). If nursing facility placement is determined appropriate, a PASRR coordinator will determine if there are other services indicated for support of the individual and if so, can they be provided by the nursing facility or do specialized services have to be procured by other means.

The goal of the PASRR coordinator is to assure that individuals who can recover, have the supports they need to return to a lesser level of care and live as independently as possible in the community. It is essential that PASRR staff have clinical strengths, aptitudes and understanding of disabilities, and strong advocacy skills so that they complete PASRR Level II assessments accurately. Accurate assessment, monitoring, and advocacy with both supports internal and external to OPWDD will assures that individuals are able to return to their best level of functioning and have the supports they need for successful community reintegration.

PRIMARY DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:

The PASSR Coordinators will work within the Bureau of Nursing and Health Services and will report to the PASRR Supervisor. In their role they will support the work within the bureau and respond to direction of the Bureau Director. PASRR Coordinators should seek to minimize reliance on nursing facilities by being informed of options, effectively monitor the nursing facility population, and address requests for alternative placements in a timely manner. The tasks and responsibilities of the PASRR coordinators will include:

* Work within databases and systems including TABS to review and verify eligibility determination for any individual referred for PASRR Level II assessment.
* Guide referral sources to the process of eligibility determination (if eligibility is not determined) to the Front Door process and advise of the necessary assessments e.g., comprehensive psychological, psycho-social, physical evaluations.
* Collaborate with Front Door staff to assure that eligibility review continues while PASRR assessment occurs.
* Communicate with hospital/and or nursing facility regarding referral package requirements and specific nursing facility identified.
* Determine based upon review of the Level I Screen, and materials received from the referral entity, the category of determination that an individual is classified into e.g., exempt or meets a categorical determination.
* Complete the Level II PASSR assessment, determine if specialized services are needed and should be provided by a qualified I/DD professional.
* Assure communication with the regional office staff about the status of admission and discharge of individuals in nursing facilities.
* Provide in person or virtual assessments (when in person is not possible) and review in assigned geographic areas and support other assessments and review needs as assigned.
* Provide continued monitoring and advocacy with both supports internal and external to OPWDD.
