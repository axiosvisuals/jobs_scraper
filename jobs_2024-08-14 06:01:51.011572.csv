Risk management plays a critical role in the functioning of any business. In the past 4 years, volatility across these asset classes - swings from +20% to 450% - has wreaked havoc on SMEs who rely on them to function. Yet, the solutions needed to limit the effects of this volatility – seasoned traders and investment banking services – remain in the hands of the few: billion dollar companies with unlimited resources. Pillar solves this by bringing protection previously available only for the largest corporations to the 30M+ SMEs worldwide who have $7T+ of underserved risk. With a few clicks, customers are able to manage their risks through Pillar’s seamless, end to end platform.


We’re on a mission to give all businesses Fortune 500-level financial services, starting with risk management, enabling them to focus on building their core business. We’ve raised $3M from world class investors like J Ventures, Neo, Graph Ventures, Ride Ventures, Expansion Ventures, the CEO of Uber and Co-Founder of Vanta, along with seasoned executives and operators from Stripe, Robinhood, and Airbnb.
