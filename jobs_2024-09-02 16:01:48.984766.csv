*Emma’s Torch is a non-profit social enterprise. Our mission is to train refugees, asylees, and survivors of human trafficking in the culinary arts and to empower them to build meaningful careers in the culinary industry. Our students participate in a full-time, paid, culinary training program in preparation for job placement. We celebrate what they have to offer, and we affirm their innate value and power. Emma’s Torch honors Emma Lazarus, a staunch advocate for refugee rights whose poem, “The New Colossus,” adorns the Statue of Liberty.*

*Founded in 2016, Emma’s Torch piloted our signature classroom café program in 2017. In May 2018, we opened our first full-service restaurant in Brooklyn, receiving recognition from outlets such as the New Yorker, the Today Show, Bloomberg, CNN, and the Guardian, among many others. The restaurant, which houses our Culinary Training Program, has cemented Emma’s Torch as a community institution. In response to increased demand for our services, we opened another program site at the main branch of the Brooklyn Public Library in April 2019, enabling us to amplify our impact and to engage the community at large in supporting our mission. Prior to COVID-19, the earned revenue from our restaurant, café, and catering businesses offset 50% of our budget, providing a steady and sustainable model for growth. This allowed us to do more with every dollar donated. More information can be found at* *EmmasTorch.org**.*
