* Respectfully coaching and mentoring team members when the PM/GM is not present
* Working weekends when prospective residents are out looking for their new home—one to two weekends per month with two days off during the week

**You Create Value by:**
========================


* Building a motivating environment that encourages your team to give their very best
* Stepping in and taking responsibility for leading when the GM is not present
* Connecting with people by engaging in meaningful conversations that demonstrate your concern and genuine desire to make them feel at home
* Taking responsibility for solving customers issues with care and enthusiasm
* Jumping in and covering for your team members when needed
* Seeking out opportunities to get to know and understand your residents

=========================


* A college degree
* 2+ years of experience in the property management, hospitality or retail industries

* A real estate license (or willingness to obtain within 90 days of hire) where applicable
