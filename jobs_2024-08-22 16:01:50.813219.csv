 **Job Description** **What does Analytics do?**


Working closely with both the Business Planning and Activation teams, Analytics designs the data strategy to tie our clients’ marketing to real-world business goals. We then mine that data to optimize campaigns and tell the stories that bring our clients closer to their marketing, helping them understand if they’re talking to the people they want, and if they’re doing it the right way.

 **What does a successful Manager look like?**

We’re don’t all look the same, and we don’t expect you to, either.

 **What does an Analytics Manager do day-to-day?**


Our Managers work very closely with the Analysts and Senior Analysts to help them stay on track with day-to-day deliverables, but also build great stories. Managers also work closely with their Associate Directors to formulate a vision for their accounts, and then execute on that vision with their Analysts and Senior Analysts. As such, Managers are mentors, managers, project managers, and thought leaders, all at the same time.

 **Qualifications**  

* Minimum 3+ years of relevant experience
* Minimum 1 year of management experience of junior-level staff
* Proficiency in Microsoft Office (PPT, Excel, Word); Expert in complex Excel formulas
* Robust experience with at least one major third-party ad server with site-side tracking (like DoubleClick, Atlas, or Sizmek)

* Experience with Pacvue, Skai (Kenshoo), Marin, Criteo or other bid management software
* Deep knowledge of key retailers, their ecosystems, and go-to-market strategies
* Experience in Consumer Package Goods industry (CPG) preferred
* Strong critical thinking skills – able to perform client-critical analysis with limited oversight
* Ability to communicate complex ideas to both external and internal clients
* Demonstrate strong project management skills
* Bachelor’s Degree in a related field

**Desired Experience:**

* Preferred 4 - 6 years of relevant experience, agency experience is a plus
* Master’s Degree in a quantitative field and/or relevant coursework
* Experience with relational databases (SQL Server, MS Access, Oracle)
* Experience with ad verification tools like Integral Ad Science and MOAT
* Understanding and familiarity with advanced analytics practices (Descriptive Statistics, Linear Regression, Forecasting)
* Experience in at least one of the following areas: Programmatic (DMP, DSP), Cross Device Measurement, Attribution Modelling
* Experience with third-party research partners like Millward Brown, Nielsen, and comScore

**The Luke's Lobster Story**

Luke’s Lobster was born out of the dream of Maine native and third-generation lobsterman, Luke Holden, to bring the quality lobster rolls of his youth to the big city. He and business partner, Ben Conniff, opened their first lobster shack in NYC’s East Village in October 2009. Now, almost 15 years later, Luke’s Lobster brings traceable, sustainable seafood to guests across the globe. We work directly with fishermen to hand pick the best seafood, bring it straight to our own seafood company in Saco, ME and then ship directly to our shacks, grocery partners, and consumers. From the dock to our guests, we’ve cut out the middleman. This means higher quality, better tasting seafood for you to enjoy and a fairer price for our fishermen. We know our fishermen, we know where and how they fish, and we work together to protect our oceans for tomorrow.

We are proud and passionate about the work environment we have fostered and are excited to see it continue to grow. We value diversity, creativity, transparency and open communication from all levels. Please visit www.lukeslobster.com for more inform

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/U--haul","http://www.uhaul.com/","2727 North Central Avenue
