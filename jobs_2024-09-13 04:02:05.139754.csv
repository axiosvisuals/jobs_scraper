------------



Pilot has significant traction with startups and technology companies. We deeply understand these customers and have built a product that startups know and love. These companies largely come to us through referrals from existing customers, and word-of-mouth.


However, there are still lots of startup companies out in the world that are *not* aware that we exist, and we'd like to do a better job reaching them. In particular, we'd like to reach them by nurturing stronger relationships with **law firms**, **banks**, **venture capital firms**, and other service providers who serve our same client base.  


As the Business Development Manager, your responsibility is to close new business by building relationships with key ecosystem partners and execute on this strategy. This role reports directly to our Head of Partner Development who is a very active participant in building relationships and leveraging the tech/startup ecosystem network.



**Key Responsibilities**
------------------------


* At the highest level, the objective is simple: get service providers to refer more prospective customers to Pilot and have the ability to sell in order to generate new clients for Pilot. This will involve:
	+ Sourcing & securing new partnership relationships for Pilot
	+ Nurturing relationships with various service providers to generate inbound leads/referrals
	+ Actively sell to and close new business opportunities via the partner channel
* Rigorously and quantitatively tracking the *metrics* around our partner relationships
	+ Inbound & outbound referrals and other high value relationship building activities
* Working with our operations team to make sure we surface referrals to partners
* Working collaboratively with the Marketing and the GTM teams to execute on key initiatives in various tech markets along the East Coast  

	+ This includes developing customized partnership collateral, planning partner events, and promoting events/webinars across various partner networks.

**About You**
-------------


* You're a business development professional who enjoys meeting with and engaging with partners in the startup/tech ecosystem.
* You've sold in previous roles and understand how to articulate Pilot's value proposition to prospects and can move the prospect through the sell cycle to ultimately convert them to clients.
* You're a builder—you're not afraid to roll up your sleeves and do what's needed to make this referral motion work.
* Have an existing deep network of relationships with law firms, banks, VC funds, etc.
* Extremely results-oriented and are excited to have clear metrics goals
* Deeply experienced in finding partners and yielding real revenue results from them
* A community builder who can host events, network, moderate and be useful to people in a non-salesy way

New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation

**Outposted Therapeutic Housing Units Program (OTxHU)**


Since 2016, Correctional Health Services (CHS) has been the direct provider of health care in the New York City jails. Deeply committed to human dignity and patient rights, CHS is part of the NYC Health + Hospitals system and is a key partner in the City’s efforts to reform the criminal-legal system. Our in-jail clinical services include medical, nursing, and mental health care; pharmacy services; substance-use treatment; social work; dental and vision care; discharge planning; and reentry support.

  

Given the high visibility of this initiative, we are seeking the highest caliber health care professionals in key clinical services to staff our Outposted Therapeutic Housing Units (OTxHU). To be located in three NYC Health + Hospital acute care facilities, the OTxHU is a pioneering approach to safely increasing access to high quality clinical care for patients in custody who have complicated health conditions. OTxHUs will bridge the gap in the continuum between care provided in the jails and inpatient hospitalization, with admission to and discharge from the OTxHU in accordance with a patient’s clinical needs. CHS will be the primary health care providers on these units and the NYC Department of Correction will provide security and custody management.

  

The OTxHU at NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue in Manhattan will be the first of this unique, groundbreaking project to open with a planned completion date as early as the end of 2024. This is an incredible opportunity to be part of a passionate and motivated team providing care to some of the City’s most marginalized, vulnerable people.

* To help support continuity of operations and care, staff selected to work in the OTxHU may also be required to work in CHS locations within the jails.
