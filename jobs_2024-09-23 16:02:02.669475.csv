StaffCo is a Professional Employer Organization, commonly referred to as a PEO, duly organized and registered under the New York Professional Employer Organization law. StaffCo and SUNY have entered into a professional employer agreement under which StaffCo is the employer of Stony Brook Clinical Practice Management Plan employees and responsible for all aspects of employment, including hirings, promotions, disciplines, terminations, the day-to-day direction and supervision of work, as well as labor relations and collective bargaining. StaffCo is fully responsible for providing all payroll and human resources services, including the payment of wages, collecting and reporting payroll taxes and maintaining any and all employee benefits.  SUNY Stony Brook Hospital is responsible for the operation of the hospital and provision of health care and is the co-employer as is necessary to conduct its responsibilities and for related licensure, regulatory or statutory requirements and obligations.

Given StaffCo’s employment responsibilities, it is deemed the “employer” for employment and labor law purposes.  Thus, the employees are private sector employees of StaffCo, not public sector employees of SUNY.  The private sector nature of the StaffCo employees has been approved by NYS Civil Service and upheld in a decision by the US National Labor Relations Board.

CPMP provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, creed, gender, national origin, age, disability, marital or veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or any other legally protected status.

Improper interference with the ability of CPMP’s employees to perform their job duties may result in discipline up to and including discharge.

Bartle Bogle Hegarty (BBH) is a world-famous creative agency that makes jaw-dropping, thumb-stopping, eye-opening work for brands across the globe. Founded in London in 1982, we now have offices in New York, Los Angeles, Stockholm, Mumbai, Singapore and Shanghai. Our first ad for Levi's showed a black sheep traveling in the opposite direction to a flock of white ones. That's where we got our logo and our guiding philosophy: when the world zigs, zag. Why? Because it's easy to zig, to go with the grain. It feels safe. It feels like the sensible thing to do. But the greater risk is failing to stand out. We believe in the power of difference to make a difference.


Our goal is a simple one: make the best work in the world. That's where you come in. We need rebels, dreamers, thinkers, mathematicians, makers, artists, visionaries, observers, the different and the unreasonable. We need Black Sheep. People who want to make the hearts flutter and minds do flips, who can change businesses and culture. People who want to make a difference, come here for something different.

* Be motivated when searching for new business opportunities within the marketing community, always searching for growth while keeping their eyes out for client needs, and quickly translating these needs into a solution to grow the agency business.

**Posting Summary**
Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey is seeking a Postdoctoral Associate for the Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine (CABM) located on the Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences Campus in Piscataway, NJ.  

The Oldenburg Laboratory at CABM is seeking an outstanding Postdoc to join an exciting neuroscience project developing and utilizing new optical and molecular tools to study neural circuits. Under the direction of the Principal Investigator (PI), Dr. Ian Oldenburg, the Postdoctoral Associate will investigate of the role of neural activity in guiding and initiating motor actions.  

  

The Oldenburg Lab uses and develops advanced microscopy techniques, including multiphoton holographic optogenetics and calcium imaging in awake head fixed mice, to understand how groups of neurons work together to enact motor actions. Neural activity is complex and high dimensional with some activity patterns being associated with movements and others not. By using our novel techniques, that can drive precise patterns of activity distributed across many neurons, we can test different theories of the ‘population code’, gaining a causal understanding of how population activity drives actions.  

  

The postdoc will work with the PI to develop an independent project, that leverages the expertise of the lab and the skills and interests of the postdoc. In addition to multiphoton imaging and multiphoton optogenetics, projects may also involve animal training, electrical and optical engineering, electrophysiology, molecular biology, and/or computational analyses. The postdoc will have the opportunity to guide the research of an undergraduate research assistant, if desired.  

  

Mentorship is a core mission of the Oldenburg Lab. All members of the lab are expected to be helpful and supportive of each other. The PI will endeavor to do what he can to help each member succeed, both within the lab and when they eventually move on. As such, every member of the lab is encouraged to explore that which interests them and to share their specific expertise. In addition, the postdoc will have the opportunity to attend scientific conferences and learn appropriate scientific methods and procedures.  

  

Among the key duties of this position are the following:* Carry out multiphoton optogenetic manipulation and imaging of neural activity in head-fixed rodents.
* Conduct rodent surgeries, rodent training, computational analyses, and other procedures necessary for the advancement of the project.
* Participate in the configuration and maintenance of laboratory instrumentation and equipment, including computers, necessary for conduct of the project.
* Prepare scientific manuscripts for publication, and contribute to the preparation of research grant and fellowship applications.
* Supervise and guide the research project of an undergraduate research assistant.
