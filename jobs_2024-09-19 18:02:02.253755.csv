Administrative Contact: John Persaud (john.persaud@mssm.edu)

 **Responsibilities** **Details of Research Project:**


Will be involved in several research projects. Will participate in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and computed tomography (CT) research regarding evaluation of cardiovascular diseases (see below). Responsibilities in this research are collection of data and image analysis. No element of patient care services will be involved.

* Prognostic value of cardiac CMR in cardiac amyloidosis


Cardiac amyloidosis is a disease in which the extracellular space in the heart is occupied by a fibrillar protein called amyloid. Amyloid can be formed by a large number of precursor proteins.


There is a need to describe cardiac MRI parameters that relate to the prognosis of the disease and others that allow to distinguish the two most frequent types of amyloidosis.

* Prognostic value of cardiac magnetic resonance in patients with sarcoidosis


Sarcoidosis is a multi-systemic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology. Sarcoidosis can affect the heart. We want to evaluate our experience regarding prevalence and prognostic significance of CMR abnormalities in patients with sarcoidosis.

  

-The Impact of Corona Virus Disease - 2019 on Coronary Atherosclerosis: Rationale and Design of the COrona VIrus Disease-2019 Computed Tomography (COVID-CT) Registry


Infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus which causes the corona virus disease - 2019 (COVID-19) has become a leading cause of death with substantial evidence that patients with pre-existing coronary artery disease (CAD) have an increased risk of serious illness and mortality following infection. The COVID-CT registry will assess whether systemic inflammation results in marked progression of coronary atherosclerotic plaque in patients with previously defined anatomic CAD on coronary computed tomographic angiography

 **Technical Duties: (include any protocols)**


 Image analyses of the CMR and CT will be performed locally by Sinai investigators for the purpose of this research. There will be no further testing performed on the patients, only analysis of already available images and collection of already available clinical data.

 **Qualifications** **Educational and other Requirements for the position:**

  

Cardiologist with extensive research experience in the field of cardiology, as evidenced by the last year and a half he has spent at our center (Mount Sinai) doing research on cardiomyopathies.

 **Experience Required:**


MD and cardiologist with experience in cardiovascular research

 **Goals/Outcomes of the Research Project:**

* Prognostic value of cardiac CMR in cardiac amyloidosis


The aim of our study will be to analyze the prognostic role of cardiac CMR and to compare their predictive value in patients with amyloidosis, as well as the usefulness of cardiac CMR in the differentiation of amyloidosis types.

* Prognostic value of cardiac magnetic resonance in patients with sarcoidosis


The aim of our study will be to evaluate associations of CMR-based presence and/or severity of cardiac sarcoidosis


-The Impact of Corona Virus Disease - 2019 on Coronary Atherosclerosis: Rationale and Design of the COrona VIrus Disease-2019 Computed Tomography (COVID-CT) Registry


The primary study objective of the COVID-CT registry is to evaluate whether in patients with pre-existent CAD on CT, infection with SARS-CoV-2 results in marked progression of total coronary atherosclerotic plaque, including increased luminal stenosis and positive remodeling, compared to patients not infected by COVID-19.
