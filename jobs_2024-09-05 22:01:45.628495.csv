--------------------------------

  


Since 2016, Correctional Health Services (CHS) has been the direct provider of health care in the New York City jails. Deeply committed to human dignity and patient rights, CHS is part of the NYC Health + Hospitals system and is a key partner in the City’s efforts to reform the criminal-legal system. Our in-jail clinical services include medical, nursing, and mental health care; pharmacy services; substance-use treatment; social work; dental and vision care; discharge planning; and reentry support.

  

Given the high visibility of this initiative, we are seeking the highest caliber health care professionals in key clinical services to staff our Outposted Therapeutic Housing Units (OTxHU). To be located in three NYC Health + Hospital acute care facilities, the OTxHU is a pioneering approach to safely increasing access to high quality clinical care for patients in custody who have complicated health conditions. OTxHUs will bridge the gap in the continuum between care provided in the jails and inpatient hospitalization, with admission to and discharge from the OTxHU in accordance with a patient’s clinical needs. CHS will be the primary health care providers on these units and the NYC Department of Correction will provide security and custody management.

  

The OTxHU at NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue in Manhattan will be the first of this unique, groundbreaking project to open with a planned completion date as early as the end of 2024. This is an incredible opportunity to be part of a passionate and motivated team providing care to some of the City’s most marginalized, vulnerable people.

* To help support continuity of operations and care, staff selected to work in the OTxHU may also be required to work in CHS locations within the jails. Additionally, while CHS seeks the most qualified individuals for these positions, preference will be given to equally qualified, internal candidates.

* Working as part of an interdisciplinary team to provide clinically driven, comprehensive discharge planning services to all patients on the unit. This includes attending rounds and treatment team meetings.
* Providing appointments and referrals to community medical, mental health and/or substance use treatment as clinically indicated.
* Providing referrals for appropriate case management services, including, but not limited to completing SPOA applications.
* Completing applications for benefits, including Medicaid, social security, and public assistance.
* Completing supportive housing applications for eligible individuals and pursuing other housing opportunities for all patients in need.
* Engaging in appropriate communication and collaboration with community providers and legal representatives, including facilitating case conferences with community-based providers.
* Serving as conduit between patients and clinical court advocates, and assisting with obtaining consents, relaying information, and other related tasks.
* Processing discharges by providing individuals leaving with medications, aftercare letters, referrals to community treatment, and Medication Grant Program (MGP) cards when indicated.
* Participating in supervision, trainings, and other departmental meetings.
* Ensuring compliance with accepted social work practices and principles and operational adherence to government rules and regulations, including compliance with reporting requirements.
* Documenting all activities in the electronic health record.

 **Department Preferences:**

About Clarks
  
Clarks, based in Somerset, England, has been at the forefront of innovative shoemaking since its foundation in 1825, when brothers James and Cyrus Clark made a slipper from sheepskin off-cuts. At the time it was ground-breaking: a combination of invention and craftsmanship that has remained at the heart of what the brand does now. In the Clarks archive of more than 22,000 pairs are shoes that have sparked revolutions and defined generations. From the original Clarks Desert Boot, first designed by Nathan Clark and launched in 1950, to the iconic Wallabee, each design has an instantly recognizable signature that makes it unmistakably Clarks.
  
**This season, we’re proud to introduce the Clarks Collective:** five incredible activists championing authentic social change. From mental health awareness and LGBTQ+ rights to greater racial equality, these trailblazers are committed to creating a brighter future for us all – bringing to life Clarks’ new global campaign, For the World Ahead. Through spotlighting their stories and supporting their chosen charities and initiatives, we’re ready to lead the way. After all, we’re originators, not imitators. It’s who we are, who we’ve always been. And to change the world of tomorrow, we’re doing things differently today.
  
Clarks International believes that the principle of equality of opportunity is fundamental to the company's operations. Our long held aim is to provide just and fair treatment for all employees. We will not discriminate on the grounds of sex, age, disability, marital status, colour, race, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation or gender reassignment.

As a long-time leader in Connecticut, New Reach hopes to now chart a new path by fundamentally shifting how our community manages and responds to the homelessness and housing insecurity crises. With increased focus on preventing evictions and providing long-term stability for those who are establishing their independence, we believe a true systems change is possible. We imagine a world where the need for shelter is minimal, because individuals and families are able to stay in their homes instead of being evicted and those who are struggling to make ends meet can get the help they need to maintain stability. We inspire lasting independence for all people affected by homelessness and poverty through a continuum of housing and support, using the most innovative, progressive, equitable and inclusive methods.


**Primary Purpose:**


The primary purpose of this role is to prevent and/or end homelessness through case management services and through assisting clients with accessing Social Security benefits through the SOAR model. SOAR (SSI, SSDI, Outreach, Access, and Recovery) is a national program, supported by SAMHSA, designed to increase access to the disability income benefit programs administered by the Social Security Administration. Half of this position's purpose is dedicated to utilizing the SOAR model with eligible adults and children who are experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness and have a serious mental illness, medical impairment, and/or co-occurring substance use disorder. The other half of this position's primary purpose is to provide case management services to individuals and families who are experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness through the provision of time-limited, intensive support services and strategies to stabilize housing. Other populations or housing support services may be assigned as secondary purposes when needed.

**Essential Functions:**

* Carry a caseload split between housing case management services and SOAR services.
* Accept referrals from local and regional sources including but not limited to the Fairfield County Coordinated Access Network (CAN), housing authorities, legal aid entities, nonprofit organizations, and other community stakeholders.
* Initiate contact with the individuals and families referred to describe program services, evaluate program eligibility, and assess the services needed to support housing stabilization.
* Complete coordinated screenings and intakes for case management services with the Coordinated Access Network (CAN), including assessment of needs and screening for eligibility for services.
* Conduct comprehensive program intakes and intensive case management services to households assigned.
* Provide education to clients and property owners/managers about the program's services to engage all parties in appropriate service components.
* Co-create housing stabilization goal plans with clients and other parties involved in services.

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/U--haul","http://www.uhaul.com/","2727 North Central Avenue

In addition, his translation program has received a $2MM NIH grant to pursue studies in the pathogenesis of peri-implantitis using cutting edge pre-clinical and clinical omics research methods to combat peri-implant inflammation.
In the past year, the Oral Biology Department received awards totaling over $5 million in extramural funding in fiscal year 2022. Researchers led by the school’s Dean Cecile A. Feldman has received a $11.7 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to research the combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen as an alternative to opioids. An RSDM faculty member is using predatory bacteria in the battle against drug-resistant infections, and the U.S. Department of Defense has invested more than $7MM in his work to help tackle deadly, antibiotic-resistant infections. A faculty member has received a $1.5MM five-year NIH grant to pursue her studies in how to regenerate dental pulp and dentin as an alternative to removing the pulp during root canals.
The approximately 25,000-square-foot, state-of-the-art RSDM Research Center provides the infrastructure to enhance clinical and translational investigations and services as a resource for the training of clinical investigators. The Center houses most of the oral biology department offices and labs and the orofacial pain labs. The center houses faculty offices for the researchers, four closed labs, 18 open labs, support labs, conference and classroom space, and a lounge area. This Center enhances RSDM abilities to secure external funding and support the school’s ability to attract new researchers.
Separately, RSDM has a clinical research center that conducts a variety of industrial trials.
Research is a required element of scholarship for most RSDM postgraduate dental students. Some students leverage this research requirement to pursue a master’s degree while completing their training. A distinctive strength of RSDM is that it has always gone beyond the traditional skill and technique training of “wet hands” dentistry. RSDM is distinguished by the academic and research training it requires of its students.**Community Service**
RSDM’s Newark Campus is the flagship site for New Jersey’s *Give Kids A Smile!* (GKAS) program. Each year RSDM’s GKSA treats hundreds of children with the support of many employees, students, and volunteers.
The school has several special programs:* Rutgers School of Dental Medicine has provided oral health care services to New Jersey’s HIV communities through the Ryan White Oral Health Services Program for over 25 years.
* The Holocaust Survivors Program was established in 2022 to deliver complimentary dental care to survivors of the Holocaust.
* Most recently, RSDM proudly offers free dental treatment to veterans under the VETSmile Program.


RSDM is a founding member of the *Oral Cancer Consortium*, a 19-member institution that promotes awareness of oral cancer and early diagnosis and treatment. The Consortium has performed more than 10,000 free screenings in the New Jersey/New York region.
The DMD program requires that students volunteer for a minimum of four hours of community project work; many develop programs working with children or seniors in the community. Others participate in a wide range of community health fairs in the metropolitan area. RSDM students participate in around 65 community service projects each year. RSDM DMD students spent over 19,000 hours in community?based service?based learning at the South Jersey sites in the 2022-2023 academic year.**Advocacy and Dental Policy**
As the state’s only dental school and as part of the state university system, RSDM has a significant opportunity to build an influential presence in the Governor’s Office, the State Department of Health, and other health leadership forums. Our state has a newly appointed director of oral health with whom we can create strong relationships to address some of the needs of New Jersey to improve the oral health care of residents. For instance, New Jersey ranks 49th out of 50 states in the percentage of population that drinks fluoridated public water at the recommended CDC level, according to the New Jersey Dental Association. RSDM also has a unique opportunity to advocate for the dental needs of children of New Jersey and patients with special care needs around the tri-state area. For example, while all children must have a physical exam to attend school, they are not required to have a dental exam unless they are in Head Start programs. This, and many other issues, can be improved with advocacy work and expertise stemming from RSDM. The school must also continue to develop relationships to strengthen its influence in the City of Newark. Policy advocacy starting from the local level can spread to state and national levels, too.

**Pediatric Dentistry at** **RSDM**  

The Pediatric Dentistry Department fulfills the School’s mission with approximately 11,000 visits annually in the Pediatric Dentistry and Special Care Treatment Center clinics for underserved children, as well as adults and adolescents with special health care needs. There is a total of 8 full- and 5 part-time faculty members in Pediatric Dentistry and Special Care.  

**Undergraduate Dental Program in Pediatric Dentistry**. The didactic course in pediatric dentistry is presented in the third academic year. The course offers instruction in basic topics including patient management, prevention and restorative techniques as well as addressing advanced areas of pediatric dentistry including sedation, the treatment of trauma, and the care of patients with special health care needs.  

Undergraduate dental students rotate through the Pediatric Dentistry Clinic one half-day each week in their third and fourth academic years. The students also rotate in the Special Care area of the clinic for 9 sessions during their fourth year.  

**Postdoctoral Pediatric Dentistry Program.**The mission of the postdoctoral program in Pediatric Dentistry at RSDM is to educate and train specialists in Pediatric Dentistry who can competently evaluate, improve, and maintain the oral health of infants, children, adolescents, and persons with special health care needs in a productive and compassionate manner.  

This is a 24-month program beginning July 1 of each year. Six new positions are offered each year. This is a combined university and hospital-based residency/certificate program open to graduates of CODA accredited dental schools and internationally trained dentists. An optional Masters of Dental Science degree program may also be pursued.  

The Pediatric Dentistry Department is a high priority and has received increased investment in its infrastructure and development to expand the school’s capacity to serve more children and enhance the education of the RSDM students.  

The Brunsden-Villa Pediatric Dentistry Clinic has 20 open-bay pediatric dental operatories and 5 closed pediatric operatories, all equipped with nitrous oxide. On-site digital radiology is also available in the clinic. This footprint allows for program expansion in the future. Today, the Pediatric Dentistry Clinic serves as the dental home to many of the Newark, NJ school children.  

Immediately adjacent to the Pediatric Dentistry clinic is the Delta Dental Special Care Treatment Center with 9 closed operatories, specially equipped to serve patients with special health care needs including persons with developmental disabilities, complex medical problems, significant physical limitations, cognitive impairment, and the vulnerable elderly. This is one of the few Special Care Clinics in the region, serving adolescents and adults from as far away as Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New York with over 10,000 patients in its registry. The Clinic accommodates nearly 5,000 patient visits annually and performs approximately 250 complex procedures in the operating room each year. The Special Care Dentistry Honors program, a unique effort that focuses on treating patients with special health care needs, gives two fourth-year students the opportunity to focus on oral healthcare for these individuals.  

The Chair, the Postgraduate Director, and the Director of the Special Needs Clinic all have private offices in the clinical space.  

**Community Health at** **RSDM**  

Community Health consists of a multidisciplinary group of individuals dedicated to health promotion and disease prevention with the elimination of oral health disparities in the community. This department includes appointed faculty consisting of 9 full- and 2 part-time faculty members who also teach in the Community-Oriented Dental Education sites. The department has received funding to support activities aimed at enhancing oral health knowledge and behaviors, and overall well-being. Disciplines represented within the department include: dentistry, medical sociology, epidemiology, geriatrics, ethics/law, dental public health, practice management, prevention and early detection of oral cancer, and community outreach and service.  

The Department of Pediatric Dentistry will continue to incorporate various Community Health activities into its program. By actively promoting the connection of oral health to overall health within the community, pediatric dentistry students have the chance to influence public policy, gain exposure to demographics, cultural factors, epidemiology, and related subjects on the health of children in the community. This emphasis on Community Health is consistent with the school’s priority of service and its tradition of leadership on many community initiatives.  

Continuing its commitment to Community Health, the dental school has recently hired the Director of the Dental Public Health Residency, a full-time faculty member in the department. This individual will be instrumental in developing a CODA accredited residency program in Dental Public Health. This will include curriculum and course development, administering the program, and providing instruction to the students. Additionally, they will provide professional service to the field, develop and maintain a line of scholarly research, and continue to publish and seek grant funding.
