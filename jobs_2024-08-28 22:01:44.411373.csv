Are you a night owl? Do you enjoy working with and balancing numbers? For us, impeccable service never stops. The Night Auditor is responsible for maintaining guest standards overnight and looking after the property’s balances from the previous day.



Some of your nightly duties include:


* Balancing paperwork, cash drawer, deposits, reconciling credit cards and submitting batches


* Input into the front office system revenue, expenses, and allowances to generate the daily reports such as the Guest Ledger Summary and the Daily Restaurant Summary.


* Completing front desk duties including check-ins/outs, room scheduling, room moves, late checkouts, stay-overs and other requests from guests.

**Where You’ve Been:**



We’re looking for someone with an Associate’s Degree or six months to one year of related experience, the ability to work evening/overnight shifts, and strong computer skills. But most importantly you must be a people-person! You will need to interact with all hotel guests and team members in a polite and positive way at all times, fulfilling requests (even challenging ones) in a timely manner. If you don't work well under pressure, this won’t be a great fit.


**When You’re Here:**



Sometimes you’ll be behind the desk—but also be prepared to move around because more than half of the time you will be standing/sitting, carrying/lifting up to 25 pounds, walking, bending/twisting, climbing stairs and more. You also must be able to accommodate varying schedules including nights, weekends and holidays. But wait, there’s a great upside: in exchange for your flexibility, we offer excellent pay, hotel discounts, F&B discounts and the opportunity to be part of an anything-but-standard growing hotel company.

Nursing Workforce Transformation Program

  

Parker's Superior Health Care Community of Practice (SHCCP) is an innovative clinical program that will train diverse Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs), Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs), and Registered Nurses (RNs) to meet Parker's mission which is "" to provide with compassion and dedication, superior quality health care and rehabilitation for adults."" With this overarching idea, the project will be framed by a ""community of practice"" model, in which cohort members interact regularly to learn professional practices, become socialized into the culture of person-centered care, and come to see themselves as valuable, empowered community members who belong in healthcare. Supported by culturally and linguistically diverse staff/mentors, individual trainees become connected to the larger social order of the healthcare community. Access to professional/social networks give them knowledge, values, beliefs, and attitudes that are conducive to their professional empowerment and success; they contribute their own sociocultural and linguistic richness.


The result will be improved quality of care, professional and economic growth for the employees, a stronger long term care workforce capable of meeting current and future demands, and increased capacity to train a diverse workforce.


For this program, we are seeking a full time **Program Director,** who will be responsible for overseeing the recruitment and training elements delivered through the community of practice model, including the development of materials that are inclusive for diverse populations, advertising campaigns, liaising with contractors and community members, and data gathering.

 At Charles Tyrwhitt our purpose is to “Make it easy for men to dress well” and we can’t do that without our specialist teams.


At this time, we’re on the lookout for an experienced Sales Associate who will be working with Mariann from our 7th Ave store location.

**What you will be doing**


You will be responsible for providing exceptional customer service and be the touch point for each and every customer. Our Sales Associates will be provided training to support our clients with styling and fit advice, as well as tailoring and custom product sales service. Your natural interest in providing exceptional service will mean you always put the customer first, providing a warm welcome to our shop, always representing the CT Brand. Your role will also include general store operations such as restocking, shipment and using the register.

**What we are looking for**


We are looking for a confident Sales Associate who can connect with our customers, deliver excellence in customer experience, and offer advice on current trends relevant to our clientele. Previous experience in a similar position is a huge advantage to this role. Interest in menswear is necessary, plus training is provided to help you understand our brand.

**What you can expect from us**


CT is a privately-owned business, so we're not a big corporate-style place to work. Our senior leaders are transparent and approachable, and we welcome ideas to make this a great place to work. We value our people whilst being product and customer obsessed.

* Quarterly bonus based on team sales performance
* Part-time paid sick leave!
* Uniform allowance
* PayActiv partnership - get wages already earned before payday
* Employee discount
* Other leave and Time off policies
* Employee Assistance Program

  

This is an hourly (non-exempt) role based in New York City. The pay range for this role is based on experience and we might reasonably expect to offer $17.00 - $18.50 per hour.

 **Who we are**


Once upon a shirt, Nicholas Charles Tyrwhitt Wheeler had the notion that he could make a better shirt at better value than anyone else in the world! He believed that all men; no matter their shape or size, where they may be in the world or indeed their budget; should be able to own a Jermyn Street quality shirt. A proper shirt. A CT shirt.


That was over 3 decades ago and whilst Charles Tyrwhitt (it rhymes with spirit by the way) is still famous for proper shirts, these days we are about so much more than collars and cuffs. Our purpose is to “make it easy for men to dress well”. We take care of the entire wardrobe, providing stylish solutions for every occasion. We make sure he gets what he wants, when and how he wants it.


Charles Tyrwhitt’s spiritual home and flagship store is located on London’s Jermyn Street, in the United Kingdom where our presence is well know. We also have a strong online presence in the US, with retail stores in 7 states and a New York head office. We also operate across Europe and Australia! Pretty impressive, eh? And as of 2022, we're proud to be recognized as a carbon-neutral retailer as we continue our journey to be a sustainable business.

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/U--haul","http://www.uhaul.com/","2727 North Central Avenue
