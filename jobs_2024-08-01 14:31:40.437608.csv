Established in 1805, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (the NYC Health Department) is the oldest and largest health department in the country. Our mission is to protect and improve the health of all New Yorkers, in service of a vision of a city in which all New Yorkers can realize their full health potential, regardless of who they are, how old they are, where they are from, or where they live.
  

  

As a world-renowned public health agency with a history of building transformative public health programming and infrastructure, innovating in science and scholarship to advance public health knowledge, and responding to urgent public health crises from New York City’s yellow fever outbreak in 1822, to the COVID-19 pandemic we are a hub for public health innovation, expertise, and programs, and services. We serve as the population health strategist, and policy, and planning authority for the City of New York, while also having a vast impact on national and international public policy, including programs and services focused on food and nutrition, anti-tobacco support, chronic disease prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, family and child health, environmental health, mental health, and racial and social justice work, among others.
  

  

Our Agency’s five strategic priorities, building off a recently-completed strategic planning process emerging from the COVID-19 emergency, are:
  

  

1) To re-envision how the Health Department prepares for and responds to health emergencies, with a focus on building a “response-ready” organization, with faster decision-making, transparent public communications, and stronger surveillance and bridges to healthcare systems 2) Address and prevent chronic and diet-related disease, including addressing rising rates of childhood obesity and the impact of diabetes, and transforming our food systems to improve nutrition and enhance access to healthy foods
  

3) Address the second pandemic of mental illness including: reducing overdose deaths, strengthening our youth mental health systems, and supporting people with serious mental illness
  

4) Reduce black maternal mortality and make New York a model city for women’s health
  

5) Mobilize against and combat the health impacts of climate change
  

  

This position may be eligible for remote work up to two days per week, pursuant to the Remote Work Pilot Program agreed to between the City and DC37  

  

The Office of Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT) is responsible for the management and oversight of the Assisted Outpatient Treatment Program in New York City. The New York State Legislature passed Kendra’s law as an amendment to the Mental Hygiene Law to allow for outpatient civil commitment of individuals with histories of serious mental illness, difficulty engaging in rehabilitation, and who present high risk to themselves or the community. The program enables these individuals to live safely in the community, avoid repeated inpatient hospitalizations, and ensure they have access to comprehensive outpatient services.

About the New York City Board of Correction  

  

The New York City Board of Correction (“BOC” or “the Board”) is a nine-person, non-judicial oversight board, which regulates, monitors, and inspects the correctional facilities of the City. Established in 1957, BOC is one of the earliest independent oversight boards of custodial and detention settings in the United States. The Mayor, City Council and presiding justices of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court for the First and Second Judicial Departments (in joint nomination with the Mayor) appoint its members. The City Charter mandates the Board’s five functions:  

  

* Establish and ensure compliance with minimum standards for the care, custody, correction, treatment, supervision, and discipline of all persons held or confined under the jurisdiction of the Department of Correction (“DOC” or “the Department”);
* Investigate serious incidents;
* Review grievances from people in custody and staff;
* Evaluate the performance of DOC; and
* Make recommendations on areas of key correctional planning.

  

The Board established the Minimum Standards on conditions of confinement in 1979, mental health care in 1985, and health care in 1991. In 2007, BOC finished a comprehensive review of the Minimum Standards and adopted a series of amendments. Since 2014, the Board has engaged in rulemaking five times, including rules related to the prevention of sexual violence, reporting on serious injuries, and the elimination of punitive segregation or solitary confinement.  

  

With offices in lower Manhattan and Rikers Island, BOC works regularly with DOC and Health + Hospitals, and often with other partners, on a wide range of criminal justice issues germane to its oversight responsibilities. BOC is a key municipal partner in the movement for safer, smaller, fairer, more humane jails, which minimize negative consequences, such as violence to persons in custody and staff. The Board brings to this work a strong emphasis on public reporting.
  

  

With new staff leadership, funding, and Board members, along with increased public attention and jail reform efforts underway, BOC is in a period of growth and change.

* Helping review and analyze requests from DOC and CHS for variances from the Minimum Standards
* Assisting in processing, evaluating and preparing responses to appeals from people in custody concerning the Minimum Standards

CPST services must be part of the treatment plan, which includes goals and activities necessary to correct or ameliorate conditions discovered during the initial assessment visits. CPST is a face-to-face intervention with the child/youth (required), family/caregiver or other collateral supports. This is a multi-component service that consists of therapeutic interventions such as counseling, as well as functional supports.

Activities are “hands on” and task oriented, intended to achieve the identified goals or objectives as set forth in the child/youth’s individualized treatment plan.

PSR activities are focused on addressing the rehabilitative needs of the child/youth as part of a treatment plan and can be provided in coordination with treatment interventions by a licensed practitioner (e.g. OLP) or provider of CPST.
