Moreover, this is best suited for an individual who thrives in ambiguity and is comfortable giving candid and considered input. The position resides within a fast-paced environment where multi-tasking, juggling and managing a number of discrete tasks are critical to success. Judgement, effective communication, and empathy are critical to reinforcing trust amongst leaders and upholding team culture.
