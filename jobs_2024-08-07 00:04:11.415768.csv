She makes friends her age everywhere she goes! She loves school! She walks to school when the weather is nice and is driven to and from school when the weather is bad. Her favorite foods are pizza, pasta, fruit, bagels, and rice. Lunch at school is a mix of packed lunch and ordering school lunch. No foods to avoid other than dairy which she is slightly sensitive to. She does not have any health concerns or require any medications.

**8 year old boy:** He is a very active 3rd grader. He has a lot of energy and loves to harness that energy doing anything game related - soccer, basketball, lacrosse, chess, and Yahtzee! He is very outgoing but can be shy with new people at first. He relates easily to his peers but also charms most adults he meets! His favorite foods are bagels, pizza, chicken nuggets, fruit, and yogurt. Mix of packed and bought lunch for school days. No foods off limits although vegetables are not his favorite to eat! He does not have any allergies, food restrictions, or medications.

**4 year old boy:** He can take a bit to warm up but as soon as you get to his level - he’ll be your friend for life. He loves puzzles, building with Legos, playing with dinosaurs and his paw patrol characters! His favorite foods are rice, eggs, protein bars, waffles, and yogurt! He is on a sleep schedule and is in bed by 7pm. He doesn't have any known allergies or health concerns!

**Schedule:** The ideal start date would be September 9th, 2024! Some flexibility would be nice to have. Mom works from home full time. Dad goes into the office on some days and works from home on other days of the week. The nanny is not needed to stay overnight; however, the family would be open to discuss travelling together in the future! The nanny will be needed for transportation to activities and school pick up. She can utilize the family vehicle while on duty! The family is open to discuss payroll vs. cash.

**Wishes:** Someone who is responsible, reliable, flexible, and professional. Someone willing to do light housekeeping. A nanny who is patient and provides love, support, structure, and fun!

The United States has the poorest birth outcomes of all developed countries with the worst maternal-infant outcomes disproportionately impacting Black, Indigenous, and underserved communities.

Cayaba Care’s mission is to improve birth experiences and outcomes in communities impacted by racial and social inequities by reimagining how maternity care is delivered. Our team is focused on building technology-enabled solutions to deliver clinical and non-clinical services in the home and virtually. Home- based maternity support is provided by our team of Maternity Navigators, who are from the communities they serve and trained in maternal community health work including prenatal education, connection to needed resources and advocacy for enrolled members. They work with a multi-disciplinary team of professionals including clinicians, therapists, social workers and lactation consultants to help pregnant and postpartum families. The Cayaba care model focuses on integration, not replacement of members’ primary obstetric provider and reducing barriers to care.

**Our Values:**

* ***Healthcare is Human:*** We partner with the communities we serve to address the unique needs of our patients and support whole person care.
* ***Pursue Excellence:*** We earn & build trust with our patients, partners, & each other by striving for excellence without compromising our standards.
* ***Uplift:*** We elevate and center underrepresented voices.
* ***Embrace Innovation:*** We are creative & resourceful in getting things done.

Historically, US Healthcare has relied on a fee-for-service reimbursement system where providers are paid based on the quantity of patient visits and procedures, rather than the quality of health outcomes.



At Stellar Health, we help primary care providers put patient health first. Our platform - a mix of technology, people, and analytics - supports providers at the point of care, delivering real-time patient information, activating practice staff, and empowering providers and care teams with incentives that reward the work they are already doing to keep patients healthy. Using the Stellar App, our web-based, point-of-care tool; practices receive a simple checklist of recommended actions that support the best quality care. Providers and care teams are then paid monthly for each action they complete, and Payors save money in reduced healthcare costs along the way.



Stellar is a US-based Health-tech backed by Top VCs (*General Atlantic, Point72, & Primary Venture Partners)* with an established product & proven operating model. We've shown that we make a real difference for physician practices and their patients.

* Relationship management of office vendors, including the coordination of contract renewals.

* Coordinating access to IT systems/technology throughout the office, partnering with teams as needed here.

* Combination of work experience, internships, and education that indicate success in this type of role. Ideally, this experience would include supporting a fast-paced office environment.
* Experience with MS Office and the Google Suite is required.
* Proficiency with MS Excel or Google Sheets (data visualizations, VLookups, Pivot Tables, etc.) is a nice-to-have.
* Experience managing and tracking budgets is a nice-to-have.
* Strong written and verbal communication skills.
* A service-oriented attitude, and the patience to 'roll with the punches'


**Pay:**


**This is an on-site position that requires presence in our Union Square Office Monday - Friday 9:00am - 5:00pm EST. The hourly rate is $19 - $21 and will be eligible for overtime**. Where a new hire falls within this range will be based on their individual skills and experience. Stellar's bands are designed to allow for individual compensation growth within the role.

Stellar rewards performance and outcomes - should you join the company, you will have the opportunity to grow your compensation over time.

Harry's Inc. is building a modern CPG company by putting people first and delivering against real unmet consumer needs.  

  

The company's flagship brand - Harry's - was founded by Jeff Raider and Andy Katz-Mayfield in 2013. After successfully launching and scaling Harry's, Jeff and Andy saw an opportunity to bring their experience building Harry's to other CPG categories where the consumer has also been historically underserved.  

  

Harry's Inc. has grown significantly over the last ten years, and is now made up of four brands - Harry's, Flamingo, Lume, Mando - and Harry's Labs, the company's incubation and M&A engine. The company employs more than 900 people across the U.S., U.K. and Germany, and is the largest CPG company built in the last 20 years.  

  

At Harry's Inc, our mission is to Create Things People Like More — whether it's a product, an experience, or an internal tool, we believe in making the things around us better for our customers, and our team.  

  

Our mission extends beyond customers and team, to the community broadly. We believe that the best business models make a positive impact. So, we set aside 1% of sales across Harry's, Flamingo, and Lume to support our social mission, including through donations to our nonprofit partners.  

  

At the end of the day, the key to our success is our amazing people. From chemists, mechanical engineers, CX associates, to creative directors, sourcing managers, and logistics specialists, the Harry's team is composed of some of the most brilliant, diverse, and humble people you'll ever meet. Our company is a place of inclusion, innovation, and deeply ingrained values.

**About the role**



As the Creative Strategy Director of the Flamingo Brand, you'll work alongside a talented team of designers, art directors, copywriters and creative project managers to build inspiring creative output that reinforces key messages of the Flamingo brand and inspires our customers. As a member of the Flamingo creative, design and implementation team, you will be responsible for developing the strategic brand essence and personality as you work with your creative partners to bring this vision to life for our customers across a number of different touchpoints from our website, to email, to packaging, in-store marketing, social media advertising and beyond.



You will work very closely with the Head of Brand (your manager) to align on our overall brand goals and plans. As the brand's ""internal agency"", you will work closely with the rest of the creative team (graphic designers, art directors, copywriters, in-house photography studio, operations and production), and work closely with our Comms team (organic social & community, partnerships, and PR), and key cross-functional partners across marketing, industrial design, retail, insights, and direct-to-consumer teams, to develop a high standard of creative output that supports the business and brand.



This role is a cross between a brand strategy and creative role, so you must get energy from partnering with producers and the art director to excel and meet a high standard, driving clear design vision and prioritization, and continuing to raise the bar on our creative output and how we show up for customers. Moreover, this role will be part of the creative leadership team for the Flamingo brand and be part of the team responsible for setting the strategic direction and goals for the brand.


**About You**

Harry's Inc. is building a modern CPG company by putting people first and delivering against real unmet consumer needs.  

  

The company's flagship brand - Harry's - was founded by Jeff Raider and Andy Katz-Mayfield in 2013. After successfully launching and scaling Harry's, Jeff and Andy saw an opportunity to bring their experience building Harry's to other CPG categories where the consumer has also been historically underserved.  

  

Harry's Inc. has grown significantly over the last ten years, and is now made up of four brands - Harry's, Flamingo, Lume, Mando - and Harry's Labs, the company's incubation and M&A engine. The company employs more than 900 people across the U.S., U.K. and Germany, and is the largest CPG company built in the last 20 years.  

  

At Harry's Inc, our mission is to Create Things People Like More — whether it's a product, an experience, or an internal tool, we believe in making the things around us better for our customers, and our team.  

  

Our mission extends beyond customers and team, to the community broadly. We believe that the best business models make a positive impact. So, we set aside 1% of sales across Harry's, Flamingo, and Lume to support our social mission, including through donations to our nonprofit partners.  

  

At the end of the day, the key to our success is our amazing people. From chemists, mechanical engineers, CX associates, to creative directors, sourcing managers, and logistics specialists, the Harry's team is composed of some of the most brilliant, diverse, and humble people you'll ever meet. Our company is a place of inclusion, innovation, and deeply ingrained values.

  


*The Harry's Inc working model is in-office Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Our beautiful* *70,000 square foot SoHo office* *is decked out with bagels on Wednesdays and lunch on Thursdays, and fully stocked kitchens with snacks, coffee, and drinks everyday. Can't forget the free products and the opportunity to have some meetings without Zoom!*

  


**About the role**



As the Creative Strategy Director of the Flamingo Brand, you'll work alongside a talented team of designers, art directors, copywriters and creative project managers to build inspiring creative output that reinforces key messages of the Flamingo brand and inspires our customers. As a member of the Flamingo creative, design and implementation team, you will be responsible for developing the strategic brand essence and personality as you work with your creative partners to bring this vision to life for our customers across a number of different touchpoints from our website, to email, to packaging, in-store marketing, social media advertising and beyond.



You will work very closely with the Head of Brand (your manager) to align on our overall brand goals and plans. As the brand's ""internal agency"", you will work closely with the rest of the creative team (graphic designers, art directors, copywriters, in-house photography studio, operations and production), and work closely with our Comms team (organic social & community, partnerships, and PR), and key cross-functional partners across marketing, industrial design, retail, insights, and direct-to-consumer teams, to develop a high standard of creative output that supports the business and brand.



This role is a cross between a brand strategy and creative role, so you must get energy from partnering with producers and the art director to excel and meet a high standard, driving clear design vision and prioritization, and continuing to raise the bar on our creative output and how we show up for customers. Moreover, this role will be part of the creative leadership team for the Flamingo brand and be part of the team responsible for setting the strategic direction and goals for the brand.
