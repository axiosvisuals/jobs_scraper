**About Your Role & Responsibilities**

Digital Marketing Associate is an entry-level role. Over time, as your role evolves, you will be responsible for defining, implementing and managing scalable marketing processes, operational best practices and effectively communicating this information to the internal team and external partners. Due to the role's entry-level nature, much of the work will be collaborative to start, where you’ll work directly with your team members to learn, to identify what has already been working for our partners (clients) and seek to implement and expand upon that.

You are driven by results and comfortable with being uncomfortable at times, particularly as you’re learning and taking on new challenges. You are an effective communicator, as over time, you will assume responsibilities of communicating your work and strategy directly with our partners and take charge on leading the strategy and outcomes for the accounts you manage.

You may have had exposure to, or have some experience in copywriting, SEO, paid media, email marketing, conversion optimization, social media marketing, and/or analytics, and this exposure or experience will serve you well in developing strategies and tactics to implement for our partners.

We are laser-focused on achieving results for our partners, and that means traffic and leads. The work that you will undertake is aimed squarely at achieving these results.

Here are some examples of what you’ll be responsible for undertaking for a partner:

* Establishing and maintaining scalable processes that ensure results-driven marketing, campaign, and lead management.
* Performing keyword research, on-page & off-page SEO tactics, technical site monitoring, and search / analytics reports.
* Managing technical aspects of key marketing systems to generate, identify, and report on traffic & leads.
* Creating and maintaining metrics and insights on marketing and sales activities, effectiveness, and business impact.
* Developing and maintaining decks/presentations with key work items, analytical data and insights for internal and external meetings.
* Ideating and executing campaigns to acquire leads and traffic via SEO, social, email, landing page development and growth-funnel creation.
* Analyzing marketing and sales data to develop insights and make / implement recommendations on improving visitor optimization and lead conversion rates.
* Monitoring and maintaining data quality within customer databases.
* Evaluating new technologies and add-on applications to improve and optimize marketing / sales performance.
* Maintaining and updating daily task lists and projects.

Your days will be varied. No one person – junior or experienced – can do this all in one day (or even one week), so keep in mind that this is an overview of responsibilities, not a task-list of daily duties.

**Skills & Experience**

* Managing, prioritizing, and ‘owning’ multiple projects and tasks at the same time in a fast-paced environment.
* Analyzing data, critical thinking, problem-solving, and effective decision-making.
* Exhibiting technical capabilities, excellent written and verbal communication, and a desire to develop and improve processes.
* Follow-through and inquisitiveness. These are two skills that are not explicitly taught in school or on-the-job but are crucial for success in a digital marketing agency.
* Demonstrating passion about achieving results, connecting results to various campaigns, and adapting to plan changes, where necessary.
* Having familiarity with current marketing best practices and trends and creativity to implement them effectively.
* Using content management systems, webpage analytics platforms, customer relationship management (CRM) platforms.
* Understanding of database maintenance and clean data best practices.

**Basic Qualifications**

* BA/BS degree or equivalent work experience.
* 0 - 2 years of digital marketing experience.
* Interest in working for boutique digital marketing agency.

**Nice-To-Haves**

* Proficiency in MS Excel & PowerPoint with the ability to conduct data analysis and report creation / maintenance.
* Exposure to or experience in copywriting, both long or short form.
* Exposure to or experience in marketing automation and / or CRM systems, such as HubSpot, or Salesforce. (Not required)
* Exposure to or experience in marketing software or platforms, such as Google Search Console, Google AdWords, MailChimp or another ESP, Facebook Ads or Publisher.
* Exposure to or experience in analytics software such as Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, Facebook Insights.
* Familiarity with web hosting, domain management, and / or content management systems (CMS).
* Experience using task or project management tools / software.

**What You Can Expect From Us**

* Base compensation (hourly, minimum 40 hours), depending on your existing experience.
* Company contributed health insurance, dental insurance, vision insurance, and a health savings plan.
* 401(k) retirement plan with company-matching.
* Professional growth. You're joining a young, but successful small agency, which means hands-on exposure to the tools and practices that tend to come at a much later stage in larger organizations.
* Upward mobility. We’re not scared to commit if you’re not. Do great work and you’ll have a career path ahead of you with increasing opportunity and responsibility that looks something like: Marketing Specialist >> Marketing Coordinator >> Marketing Manager >> Director of Marketing.

The Strategic Growth Manager then meets with the Prospective Agent to discuss the Compass value proposition (technology, marketing, culture and growth). SGPs are the future of the Strategic Growth organization. In addition to the direct impact this role has as a partner to the SGMs in the market, you will ultimately be working toward the goal of becoming an SGM yourself. From onboarding all the way through a formal SGP-to-SGM training program, your focus will be on developing the skills and knowledge that line a direct path into the closing sales position.

* Collaborate cross-functionally to create new processes and refine existing processes through innovative thinking
* Analyze addressable market in nascent geographies and create demand for disruptive technology
* Become a critical part of the high performing team, adding value to each SGM's sales process


**QUALIFICATIONS**


* Bachelor's degree with 2+ years of relevant experience with history of strong performance (SDR, Customer Success/Service, Direct Sales, Account Management)
* Strong interpersonal and rapport-building skills, glass-half-full mentality, natural leader
* Self-starter attitude and ability to exercise judgment and solve difficult problems without direct supervision, comfortable with ambiguity
* Excellent communication skills; ability to effectively lead client meetings and presentations
* Highly organized; ability to handle multiple deadlines simultaneously
