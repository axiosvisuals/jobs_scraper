This position serves as the pivotal link between the patients in the SNF and the remote clinical team of a third-party provider, focusing exclusively on managing and coordinating telemedicine care programs.

**Responsibilities**



Act as the primary liaison between SNF patients and the remote clinical team, coordinating telemedicine services such as RPM and CCM.



Facilitate the creation and implementation of patient-centered care plans by working closely with remote healthcare providers, specifically tailored to telemedicine frameworks.



Ensure continuous monitoring and assessment of patient conditions, coordinating the flow of vital data between the SNF and the remote clinical team.



Educate and support both patients and SNF staff on the effective use of telemedicine programs, promoting optimal management of chronic conditions and healthcare outcomes.



Advocate for the patient’s needs, ensuring they receive comprehensive and effective care through the telemedicine programs.



Bridge communication and operational gaps between SNF staff and the remote clinical team to ensure seamless delivery of telemedicine services.



Manage and maintain patient records, ensuring accurate and timely communication of health data between the SNF and the remote clinical team.



Monitor and evaluate patient progress within telemedicine programs, working collaboratively with all parties to adjust care plans and interventions for better health outcomes.


**Qualifications**



Certification as a Medical Assistant or in a related healthcare field.



Experience in telemedicine, RPM, or CCM programs, with a strong understanding of care coordination within these settings.



Demonstrated ability to communicate effectively and coordinate between patients, healthcare providers, and facility staff.



Strong organizational and multitasking skills, with the capacity to manage complex care programs and detailed patient data.



Proficiency in electronic medical records (EMR) and telemedicine platforms, with a high level of digital literacy.



Knowledgeable in medical terminology, chronic condition management, and the specific requirements of telemedicine care delivery.



Independent worker with team collaboration skills, committed to enhancing patient care and outcomes through effective telemedicine coordination.


**Ideal Candidate**



The ideal candidate is a dynamic and empathetic professional, skilled in navigating the nuances of telemedicine and adept at coordinating care between remote clinical teams and patients in SNFs. This role is perfect for someone passionate about leveraging technology to improve healthcare delivery and patient outcomes in a telemedicine setting.
