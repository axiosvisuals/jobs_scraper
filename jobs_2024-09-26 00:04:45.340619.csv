Our mission is to empower young adults to reach their full potential by providing comprehensive youth development services in a diverse and caring environment. At The Door, youth can access health care and education, mental health counseling and crisis assistance, legal assistance, college preparation services, career development, housing support, arts, sports and recreational activities, and nutritious meals all free and under one roof. By providing participants with our suite of integrated services, we seek to provide any motivated young person with the tools, resources, and opportunities needed to successfully transition to adulthood.


Roundabout Theatre Companys Education and Community Partnerships programming has offered nationally recognized programs that use the stimulating power of the arts to inspire and engage since 1996. Our goal is to use theatre to promote social equity through three core program areas: Teaching & Learning, Career Training, and Community Partnerships. Roundabouts programs (school partnerships, youth ensembles, fellowships, artist residencies, etc.) aim to use theatre to promote social equity and correct injustices while building an American theatre that thrives on diversity. The Door works with Roundabout to support its participants, programming, and mission.


In 2016, Roundabout, in partnership with the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE), which represents many of the behind-the-scenes workers in theatre and film, developed a technical theatre workforce program.

**Who we are:**


Douglaston Development, Levine Builders, and Clinton Management are a dynamic privately held group of companies with a unique owner-builder-manager advantage, known collectively as The Douglaston Companies.


The Douglaston Companies started with the founding of Levine Builders in 1979 with just two people. Standing by our core values of integrity and ethics for the past four decades the firm has grown to 200 employees. By providing general contracting and construction management services, Levine Builders has built, renovated, and rehabilitated thousands of residential units and millions of square feet of commercial, hotel, office buildings, retail centers, religious, educational, and healthcare facilities.


With the later establishment of Douglaston Development as the driving engine of the organization, the two companies worked in unison to leverage each others expertise to develop and build most complex projects while also growing and thriving in challenging markets.


In 2002, Clinton Management was founded to manage the expanding portfolio of developments created by Douglaston Development and constructed by Levine Builders. Clinton Management oversees a broad portfolio of moderate-income housing, luxury apartments, commercial, and retail properties.
