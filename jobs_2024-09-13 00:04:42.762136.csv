As part of Atlas, we are offering FFT to young people at elevated risk for violence in the community, victimization, or a re-arrest. FFT is an evidence-based intervention for youth and families. This high-quality, strength-focused family counseling model is designed for high-risk youth and young adults who have been referred by the criminal court, juvenile justice, mental health, school, or child welfare systems. Services are short-term and typically offered in the home, though services can be offered in the office or other community settings.  

  

**About ATLAS HOPE:**

The AH program aims to meet the economic, emotional, and mental health needs of adult men, ages 25 and older who have had a history of trauma, lived experience with violence, and involvement in the criminal legal system by providing outreach, transitional employment, behavioral health supports delivered primarily through CBI, and coaching and case management.

The Center for Justice Innovation is a community justice organization that centers safety and racial justice. Since our founding in 1996, the Center has partnered with community members, courts, and the people most impacted to create stronger, healthier, more just communities. Our decades of experience in courts and communities, coupled with our field-leading research and practitioner expertise, help us drive justice nationwide in innovative, powerful, and durable ways. For more information on how and where we work, please visit www.innovatingjustice.org.


The Center is a 900-employee, $100 million nonprofit that accomplishes its vision through three pillars of work: creating and scaling operating programs to test new ideas and solve problems, performing original research to determine what works (and what doesn’t), and providing expert assistance and policy guidance to justice reformers around the world.

**Operating Programs**


The Center’s operating programs, including the award-winning Red Hook Community Justice Center and Midtown Community Justice Center, test new ideas, solve difficult problems, and attempt to achieve systemic change within the justice system. Our projects include community-based violence prevention programs, alternatives to incarceration, reentry initiatives, and court-based initiatives that reduce the use of unnecessary incarceration and promote positive individual and family change. Through this programming, we have produced tangible results like safer streets, reduced incarceration, and improved neighborhood perceptions of justice.

**Research**


The Center's research teams are staffed with social scientists, data analysts, and lawyers who are academically-trained or have lived experience and who conduct research in the U.S. and globally on diverse criminal-legal system and justice issues. Their work includes evaluating programs and policies; conducting exploratory, community-based studies; and providing research translation and strategic planning for system actors. The Center has published studies on topics including court and jail reform, intimate partner violence, restorative justice, gun violence, reentry, sixth amendment rights, and progressive prosecution. The research teams strive to make their work meaningful and actionable to the communities they work with, policymakers, and practitioners.

**Policy & Expert Assistance**


The Center provides hands-on, planning and implementation assistance to a wide range of jurisdictions in areas of reform such as problem-solving courts (e.g., community courts, treatment courts, domestic violence courts), tribal justice, reducing incarceration and the use of fines/fees and reducing crime and violence. Our current expert assistance takes many forms, including help with analyzing data, strategic planning and consultation, policy guidance, and hosting site visits to its operating programs in the New York City area.

**Center Support**


A dedicated support team within the Center ensures the smooth functioning of operations across various domains, including finance, legal, technology, human resources, fundraising, real estate, and communications. Comprising 15% of the organization's staff, these teams provide essential infrastructure support and innovative solutions aligned with the Center's mission and values.

Join a Legacy of Hope and Empowerment at Covenant House New York!


For over 50 years, Covenant House New York (CHNY) has been at the forefront of transforming lives by providing comprehensive shelter, housing, and wrap-around support services for vulnerable homeless, runaway, and exploited youth. As the largest provider of these essential services in New York City, CHNY impacts the lives of over 1,500 young people aged 16-24 every year.


At CHNY, our doors are open to all young people in need, regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression. Our dedicated team offers various services, including shelter, housing, education, employment, health, mental health support, youth development, and anti-human trafficking initiatives. We operate with harm reduction and trauma-informed principles to ensure the best care for our youth.


But our mission goes beyond immediate support. We are passionate advocates for systemic change, influencing public policy, and raising awareness of the critical issues surrounding youth homelessness. Our ultimate goal is to provide a safe refuge and empower young people to build a brighter future founded on compassion, unconditional love, and absolute respect.


Join us in making a difference in the lives of countless young people. Join a team that inspires long-term transformation and hope.

**Job Summary**


The Rights of Passage (ROP) Resident Advisor (RA) provides supportive services to up to 20 young people aged 16-21 living in an ROP site in the Bronx. Reporting to the Program Coordinator of the ROP site, the RA is an energetic, creative, and diligent team member that includes case managers and a cadre of specialty staff, including employment/education specialists, housing specialists, youth development staff, and credentialed mental health staff.


ROP is a transitional living program funded by the NYC Department of Youth and Community Development, where youth may reside for up to 24 months. The RA supports all aspects of the program and holistically assists youth living at the site, providing support and motivating encouragement wherever needed. RAs are also responsible for cooking meals for up to 20 youth, sometimes with other staff and/or youth or on their own. RAs will be assisted in obtaining food handling licenses and other culinary training if required. RAs also help keep the site clean and well-maintained, including working with youth and other staff to manage garbage and day-to-day cleaning of all areas of the site. These sites will also use evidence-based and other proven models. RAs will be expected to participate in training and implementation activities for these social service models. Ultimately, RAs assist youth in achieving the goals of ROP: stabilize and address any immediate trauma experienced by the youth in our care, maintain housing stability, and help them advance toward their individualized goals, including a long-term housing plan while ensuring the site is well-maintained.


As these sites are new to CHNY, the RA must be comfortable in a rapidly changing environment where processes and protocols are being developed and refined as the program operates.

**A bit about us:**



Founded in 2013 by Mike and Alex Faherty and Kerry Docherty, Faherty is a family-run lifestyle and apparel brand fueled by purpose and optimism. Our goal: to build a new American legacy by creating high-quality, sustainably minded, feel-good favorites that will bring you joy to wear.



We feel a deep responsibility to do things differently: to promise comfort without compromising quality. To hold ourselves to a higher standard with a lower environmental impact. To leave the world a better place than we found it.



We recognize the impact the fashion industry has on the world, and we're dedicated to learning how to be better stewards of the planet. We believe the power of conversation and connection can make real change, and we're committed to supporting people and organizations doing work that we believe in.



Our passionate leadership team comes from different backgrounds but share a singular goal: to deliver on our promise of comfort and craftsmanship. To work side-by-side in a collaborative, energetic, and creative environment every day, like the family we are.



We welcome everyone — and we mean everyone. We believe a diversity of viewpoints, experiences, and backgrounds only serve to make our team stronger, which is why we strongly encourage those from historically and systemically marginalized communities to apply: BIPOC, women, and people in the LGBTQIA+ community, to name a few. We strive to lead consciously, bravely, and inclusively — and to reflect those values in our work. We live by six key pillars:

  



Be The Best



Stay Authentic



Better Together



Spread Good Vibes



Deliver On Promises



Lead Consciously, Bravely, and Inclusively

***Who We Are***

theCoderSchool is an after-school drop-off program for kids learning to code. We provide a **fun, energetic, and inspirational environment** to bring out that inner hacker in all learners! The future will be ever more dependent on technology so let's get our young generation ready. Learn to Code, Change the World.

***Job Summary***

theCoderSchool is looking for passionate Code Coaches to teach our next generation how to change the world! You will meet incredible kids, teach them how to code - and how to think like a coder - and be rewarded with an amazing experience. This is a part-time position for a unique partnership with the Harlem Children's Zone - Employment and Technology Center (ETC). The Harlem Children’s Zone is a nationally recognized charter school system in NYC. The ETC is an after-school program that prepares high school scholars for careers in STEM and technical arts. Scholars learn to use cutting-edge technologies, gain career-ready skills, and grow a network of professional contacts. More information about the ETC can be found here: https://hcz.org/our-programs/the-employment-and-technology-center/

***Responsibilities***

* We will be working with 2 groups this school year (Year 1 and Year 2 students)
* Year 1 & 2 students will be beginning and intermediate coders.
* Program Dates are September 30 - June 12 (there will be no class during all school holidays throughout the year)
* Classes will be held in the ETC computer lab located at 304 W 117th St, New York, NY 10026
* **Curriculum:** The students will have an opportunity to use *Replit* and other web based coding platforms. During the first 2 weeks we will assess their coding skills and explore different languages. By week 3, the students will choose to learn and start working on a project in one of the following languages: HTML, Python, javascript, or unity.

**This position rocks because you will:**

* Meet, mentor, and grow amazing kids who are ready to be our next generation of coders!
* Meet and communicate with parents - many of whom will be techies themselves, who work at some of the best companies and startups in the area.
* Give back to the community and help grow our next generation by sharing your knowledge of technology
* Have the flexibility to teach what you're most comfortable with, and learn new things along the way

***Requirements: What do we want from you?*** Read on.

* ***PASSION***. All caps! This is all about giving back to the kids. We need to see goose bumps when your student ROCKS a code challenge.
* **Great Communicator**. There will be plenty of chatting with colleagues, students and of course patience is a virtue when it comes to kids!
* **Street Cred**. Our college-level Code Coaches will have Comp Sci or Engineering or similar major at a nearby accredited school. Our Veteran Code Coaches will have relevant industry experience.
* **Coding Skills**. Strong grasp of general technologies, proficient coder and uber-logical thinker. General knowledge of popular languages with hands on skills in a few is required - Block based coding, Javascript, Python, HTML and some unity are most helpful. Deep technical skills aren't required - we prefer you communicate well and find answers along with students rather than knowing everything upfront.

Sound awesome? Send us an email and let's get started! **We are looking to hire immediately!** This position will feel less like a job and more like a fun experience filled with learning and laughing with kids. Not a bad way to spend a day!!
