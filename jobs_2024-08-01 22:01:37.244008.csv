-----------------------


Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.  

  

So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.  

  

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.**Job Description**

Breaking Ground operates nearly 4,000 units of housing across New York City, along with housing in upstate New York and Connecticut. Supportive housing - affordable housing paired with services designed to help people maintain their homes for the long-term - is widely recognized as a proven and cost-effective solution to chronic homelessness.
  
  

But we didn't stop at providing housing. Breaking Ground's programs and services help people experiencing street homelessness - especially those who have been on the streets the longest - to come indoors. Through our Street to Home outreach program and transitional housing resources, we help people get, and stay, on the path to a permanent home.
  
  

Breaking Ground’s Street to Home program makes regular contact with more than 2,000 street homeless individuals and connects more than 500 individuals to housing, medical and mental health services, substance abuse counseling, and other essential supports each year. The caring, individually tailored attention clients receive at each stage of their journey from street to home ensures that more than 95% of people who Breaking Ground places remain stably housed.
  
The Housing Advocate works with street homeless conducting street outreach with the objective of engaging individuals to determine their eligibility for Street to Home services and to help secure appropriate housing solutions for all people who are street homeless. If chronic, the Housing Advocate will build a relationship with clients utilizing motivational interviewing to encourage the client to work towards permanent housing. If not chronic, Housing Advocate will utilize available resources to secure other housing placements. The Housing Advocate will always work with a partner and will spend most of the shift in an automobile conducting street outreach. The incumbent will respond to 311 calls and community concerns; participate in Code Blue and Code Red alerts; identify new hotspots/encampments and work to eradicate existing hot spots/encampments; conduct a bi-annual vulnerability index on all clients in their catchment area; and enter all required data into outreach database(s).

Our humble beginnings led to the creation of the Human Defense Platform, the backbone of all our products that safeguards enterprises from sophisticated bots, fraud, and account abuse. Today we verify the humanity of more than 20 trillion interactions per week for some of the largest companies and internet platforms.** **Our hacker roots still permeate everything we do. You will be a part of the HUMAN front line in our commitment to protecting companies (and in turn, their customers) from both revenue and reputation risk caused by digital attacks. However, HUMAN is not the center of this story. Humans like yourself are. We firmly believe in putting people first. This approach spans our extensive total rewards package, inclusive of competitive compensation, benefits, stipends - as well as our day-to-day culture - to ensure every human is empowered to do the best work of their life. We want to hear about the marathon you’re training for. We want to see pictures of your pets. We want to know your favorite robot (we have many).** **Even if you’re not a conventional “hacker” we can assure you that you are a hacker in your own right. We want to work with people like you who break down problems to build up better solutions. That’s what makes us HUMAN.

Together under the HUMAN brand, we will disrupt the economics of cybercrime. We hope you can join us in that mission.**  

The emerging Products team is tasked with building the next generation of Human solutions. We identify market opportunities and synergies with existing products, and bring new products to market that will serve as the growth engines and the future of the company. This is the place where new products are initiated, and where young products are grown and begin their maturation and scaling process. This particular role is for the product leader for the recently launched Account Defender product - Human’s foray into website fraud and abuse
### **What you'll do:**

+ Own the strategy, execution, and roadmap for the Account Defender product
+ Coordinate between different teams, and work with senior management to plan strategy and move forward strategic initiative
+ Supervise a team of technical product managers, guide and mentor them as they handle the day to day requirement building
+ Work with Go-to-market stakeholders to meet and exceed revenue and growth targets
+ Engage with customers to understand their pain points and build empathy with their product journey and needs, handle escalations, and understand future directions to create new value
+ Work directly with sales to drive sales, and act as a subject matter expert
+ Be the subject matter expert for Account-based fraud, guiding company direction and long-term investments
+ Be able to dive into data and understand usage patterns and fraud challenges to drive roadmap decisions
+ Be the “single pane of glass” for the company on the current situation with the product, customers, sales processes for the product, pipeline and the health of the business

### **Who you are:**

+ Experienced product leader, with track record of working on early stage products in dynamic environments and growing them to maturity and strong growth
+ Strategic thinker who can develop a vision for future directions, while still being able to understand the technical details, challenge other stakeholders, and drive day to day execution
+ Fast learner who can become an industry expert quickly and provide thought leadership
+ Flexible thinker who can change opinions and pivot quickly to take advantage of new information or sudden opportunities
+ Independent and self-sufficient - drive execution through self initiative without guidance
+ Capable of exerting influence through communication and convincing without resorting to arguments from authority
+ Driven, ambitious, hungry to learn and to develop. Humble and curious
+ Strong sense of ownership
+ Experienced with at least one of the following: B2B2C cybersecurity, UEBA, or online web fraud detection.
+ Willingness to dive into the data and details, and become an expert able to offer guidance from a position of knowledge

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington).

Our broad and deep talent/resource pool enables us to provide clients with a rich range of high-quality tutoring and personal coaching at very reasonable rates.
