The Nation’s Top Physical Therapy Practice (that’s us!) is looking for lifetime members to join our unconventionally passionate family.
  
  

**About the Company:**  

At SPEAR, we spend each day inspiring, caring for, and elevating the New York City metro area. Together, we have built a passionate and empathetic team motivated to become the best version of itself. We respect, lead, and challenge each other to always improve ourselves, our teammates, and the health of our communities.
  
At our core, we develop people. By providing each other the ideal opportunities and tools to flourish—both personally and professionally—we have fostered a culture rooted in growth. And we have fun doing it!
  
This focus on professional development and organizational expansion has resulted in our collective achievement of several honors and recognitions from top medical, academic, and business communities. SPEAR recently received Columbia University’s Award for Leadership in Clinical Education, given to the top 1/10th of 1% of practices. SPEAR was named six times to the Inc5000 list of fastest growing private companies in America, as well as having been named by SmartCEO magazine as a Future500 company five times. SPEAR was also chosen to appear in Chase Bank’s National Ad Campaign, Mission Main Street, as a thriving small business committed to serving community interests. SPEAR was the first private practice to ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange when on May 4th, 2016, during small business week, the executive team was featured on MSNBC.
  
  

In 2016, SPEAR Physical Therapy was chosen as the American Physical Therapy Association Private Practice Section’s “Nation’s Top Practice,” recognizing the company for its dedication to innovation and excellence.
  
  

In 2020, at the peak of the pandemic, the SPEAR Physical Therapy team dedicated themselves to the New York City community. This dedication was a testament to the unrelenting commitment that SPEAR providers have for their patients—the resilience the team demonstrated, and the innovative care provided to our patients–during the events of 2020 are what led SPEAR to be awarded “The Nation’s Top Practice” by the WebPT Ascend Conference. To be recognized during this historically difficult year was a proud moment for the organization and all our incredibly devoted team members.
  
  

In the years to come, SPEAR will continue its path of growth, with further expansion planned beyond the New York City Metropolitan region.

Most of our teachers teach 1-3 classes per week 1 hour per day (depending on schedule/availability).  
Classes are immediately after school and on site at schools starting in September or October. **Most classes run from 3-4 pm and you would need to arrive by 2:30 pm or so on site. Occassionally schools book classes at 3:30 pm.** Please only apply if you have this time period available at least once or twice per week and factor in any commutes you may have.

**Details for Programmable Robots class**

We use Edison robots for this class with full curriculum. We will be utilizing Edblocks and Edscratch plans which you can access on meetedison.com You do not need to be a robots or computer programming expert (though it helps and is appreciated). If you are comfortable with tech, can follow a curriculum and prep in advance, this should be an easy class to instruct. We do have a second teacher already booked due to class size (20 students) so it would be a co-teacher class where either instructor should be prepared to lead at any time while the second instructor acts as support and classroom management.

**Class dates:** 9/9/24- 11/25//24 (Mondays)

**Time**: 3:15pm- 4:15pm

**Neighborhood:** Upper East Side (E.90's)

**Pay rate:** $50 per session

This class comes with full curriculum and you will be teaching a bright group of students.

Our classes run anywhere from 8 weeks to 18 weeks, again depending on the school. We share all school information and ask that you make sure all times, dates, subjects work for you before committing. We provide curriculum for our classes, but would prefer instructors who can enhance and adapt our curriculum. Pay is $50 per class (up to an hour of active teaching, though you are expected to arrive at least 20 minutes before start time.) We pay higher for specialized classes like piano, guitar, dance, and ASL (where instructors would need to provide their own curriculum) and very experienced teachers. 90 minute classes also pay a $75 minimum.

Requirements:  
-**Must have New York City Department of Education fingerprint clearance OR willingness to obtain immediately (it's easy and we can nominate you. It is a prerequisite of employment- it does not expire)**   
-**afternoon availability to be on site at a Upper West Side, Upper East Side, midtown, lower Manhattan or Brooklyn areas closest to Manhattan (depending on school schedule and your location preferences ) around 2:30 pm. Most classes run from 3 until 4 pm with around an hour of active teaching time or around that time frame. Please let us know if you are also open to Hoboken, NJ.**  
**- be fully vaccinated (vaccination is still a requirement for all of our private schools, though some of our schools require boosters too)**  
- **experience working with elementary aged group of students**

This job is perfect for part time teachers, substitutes, retired educators, students, part time employees, etc. - basically anyone who has other things going on in their life where the time commitment availability for mid-afternoon teaching will not be a problem/conflict and who has other things going on in their life and could use extra cash.  
Please send a resume, a little blurb about yourself and note your availability for a short preliminary phone/zoom interview. We will respond to all qualified, local candidates.

Here is a sample of classes we teach: https://www.paenynj.org/classdescriptions

As of right now we are actively hiring for: Cartoon animation and comics creation, piano, chess, soccer, programmable robots, French Immersion, LEGO, Spanish Immersion, French Immersion, Digital Photography, Healthy Kids Club, Music Kids, Pokemon Arts Academy, Group Piano, and Hip Hop dancing.

If there is anything you would like us to consider you for you can submit a short recorded video of about 5 min or so showcasing your teaching style/skills for a young elementary aged group class, we’d appreciate it and can follow up with a very short phone or zoom call interview. We can also send you one or two of our typical lessons, if you prefer to showcase something from our curriculum. If you would like to create/share a short instructional video please do so.
