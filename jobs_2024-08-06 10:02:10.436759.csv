It is believed that Tito was born in the small beach village of Todos Santos, on Mexico’s Baja peninsula - or maybe it was just outside of Haleiwa, on the North Shore of Oahu.  

  

Then again, it might have been the town of Balboa, on the Pacific coast of Panama.  

  

Truth is, no one’s quite sure where he’s from! Whenever he’s asked, Tito simply leansback, scratches his chin & replies (in his own language that we call “Tito-Speak”), “I come from da beach, brah. No matter where I am, I’m always at da beach!”
  

  

Spoken like a true hedonist. It’s that love for the hedonistic beach lifestyle & good times that’s at the heart & soul of Tito’s Burritos & Wings.  

  

At Tito’s Burritos & Wings, our slogan is, “It’s all good,” & that motto applies to the whole philosophy we built our business on.  

  

In other words, we are 100% committed to giving our customers nothing but goodness; the tastiest food, prepared & served in a casual & easy-going manner, always at a good value.
  

  

We use only the freshest ingredients in everything we prepare, every order is custom-made the way that YOU want it. It might take a few minutes longer, but we’ll make sure it’s worth the wait.  

  

If you’re eating here, kick back & enjoy the music or watch our “wish I was there” TitoVision TV, always tuned to “da beach.”  

  

It is our wish that you enjoy everything that Tito’s Burritos & Wings has to offer, & that you leave with an “It’s all good!” feeling.
  

  

PS: You might see Tito around the shop every once in a while, but sightings are indeed rare. After all, you can’t be a true hedonist & a workaholic at the same time!","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Tito's-Burritos-&-Wings","","","","","","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/3993e2b23f72186e7950b3a3bdb6354f","","",""

 **JOB DESCRIPTION**

**Electrical Technician**

**Job Duties:**

**Work with the team:**You stay in contact with your supervisor and your team to make sure the work orders are completed efficiently – everyone pitches in because it’s ultimately about serving the customer.

**Develop your expertise:** You install and repair various Electrical systems, knowing that you’re ultimately helping people live comfortable and safer lives. Over time, you gain a growing expertise at diagnosing problems and understanding how to repair or replace them. You respond to emergencies with safety as your top priority.

**Become a trusted professional:** You keep your tools neat, clean, and well-maintained so they’re handy and ready for use and safe. You’ll learn to prepare written materials (e.g. scope of work, work orders, bids, equipment inventory, etc.) because you know that this keeps everyone informed – from the customer to the team back at the office.

 **Job Requirements:**

**You love to learn:** You have a high school diploma or equivalent. Most importantly, you have a drive to learn more because you know that it serves everyone – from the customer to the team to yourself. You’re even willing to be cross-trained in other trades.

**You’re a tech-savvy people-person:**You love the puzzle and adventure of understanding and completing the technical challenges you’re posed with every day. At the same time, you’re comfortable talking to a homeowner and professionally educating them on what their options are.

**You’re ready to work:** You have experience servicing, troubleshooting, diagnosing, repairing and installing Plumbing components. You possess your own tools necessary to complete your work. You have a driver’s license, a ready-to-work attitude, and no problem handling the physical demands of the job – such as lifting heavy equipment or balancing on a ladder. You’re capable of working in enclosed spaces or doing a significant amount of crawling and standing. (Hey, if this is a surprise to you then you probably shouldn’t be a Plumbing technician).

**You’re a professional:** You are clean, neat, and well-groomed in appearance and you understand that safety is paramount. You won’t work anywhere that is unsafe but you know safety is a two-way street, so you won’t do anything unsafe either.
