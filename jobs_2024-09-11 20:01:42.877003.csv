The State University of New York College of Optometry advances visual health and patient care through leadership in education, research and service. More than a half century ago a group of dedicated optometrists and benefactors came together to create an institution that would support optometric education, vision science research and extend quality vision care to all New Yorkers and the surrounding community. The State University of New York College of Optometry evolved from this mission. Since we opened our doors to our first class of students in 1971, the College has grown to become one of the leading optometric education and vision research centers in the world. The College houses the University Eye Center — one of the largest outpatient vision care clinics in the country—and engages in cutting edge research that is helping to shape the future of optometric care.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Suny-College-of-Optometry","","","","","","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/c841d3afca366b8a1d7abdd51c1218e3","","",""

StaffCo is fully responsible for providing all payroll and human resources services, including the payment of wages, collecting and reporting payroll taxes and maintaining any and all employee benefits.  SUNY Stony Brook Hospital is responsible for the operation of the hospital and provision of health care and is the co-employer as is necessary to conduct its responsibilities and for related licensure, regulatory or statutory requirements and obligations.

Our mission is to empower immigrants and refugees with the tools they need to acclimate successfully to the world around them and become active participants in their communities. While our doors are open to all,AAFSC has developed cultural and linguisticexpertiseinserving members of NYC’s Arab, Middle Eastern, North African, Muslim, and South Asian (AMENAMSA) immigrant and refugee communities.AAFSC promotesmental and physical well-being and community power. We ensure families are knowledgeable about their rights and equipped toparticipatein civic society with confidence and security.

Finally, wehelpliftupthe voices and needs of under-represented communities and champion gender-, racial-, restorative-, and immigrant justice.

 **JOB SUMMARY:**


The Cultural Broker provides strategic advocacy as well as information & referrals for our constituents as they and their case workers navigate complex education, health, and social services systems across New York City. By doing so, the Cultural Broker improves accessibility for clients and advocates for change in these systems. This role builds key relationships and support networks with state & government entities and community-based organizations in order to assess or voice gaps in resources.This role also provides efficient case and administrative support for their assigned Preventive Services unit, including performing administrative tasks, such as maintaining case files, updating referral information, and assisting with the upkeep of case records. A successful person in this role will bring a trauma-informed, culturally-responsive, and linguistically-appropriate lens to this position. A commitment to immigrant, refugee, and low-income communities is essential for success in this role.

  

The Cultural Broker will be assigned to either a Solution Based Casework (SBC) unit or a Functional Family Therapy (FFT) unit. The Solution Based Casework (SBC) model is based on three theoretical foundations: family life cycle theory, relapse prevention/CBT theory, and solution- focused family therapy. Partnership with families in each case is critical to reducing risks and solutions should utilize prevention skills to achieve those goals. The Functional Family Therapy (FFT) model works with youth between the ages of 11 to 18 who struggle with behavioral and/or emotional problems and have been referred by the juvenile justice, mental health, school, or child welfare system. As a strength-based model, FFT focuses on acceptance and respect and uses assessments and interventions to determine risk and protective factors in relation to the family and youth’s development.

Are you looking for a job where you can use your experience to propel your career into management? At New York Life, we will invest in you from the start to help you learn and grow as a financial professional first. We’ll train you in valuable skills, such as marketing, business development, and customer relationship management, and provide you with the tools you need to further your career. Then we’ll train you and provide you with access to the tools you need for a career in management.

**What we’re looking for**  
We’re looking for people who want to make a lasting impact on the financial well-being of individuals, families, and small businesses—motivated people who can answer yes to one of the following questions:

* Do you have sales or managerial experience in another industry?
* Have you previously run your own business?
* Do you have an MBA or other equivalent degree?

In the Accelerated Path to Management Program, you’ll start off as a financial professional, learning how to sell our products, building client relationships, and meeting specific requirements1 before transitioning into a management role.  
You’ll then undergo a six-month intensive training program designed to prime you for success as a manager. You will use that experience to understand how to recruit and coach others to success.

**What we offer**

**Your first year**  
You’ll learn firsthand about a financial professional’s role and day-to-day work by working as a financial professional for the first year of your career journey with New York Life. We will provide you with complete training, access to digital tools, and a comprehensive product suite.

**Training and resources**  
You will receive top-notch training that will give you an understanding and appreciation for the strength and value of  
New York Life. Beyond this training and support, New York Life will provide access to the resources you need to succeed day-to-day, including experts on hand to answer your questions and a suite of digital sales, prospecting and marketing tools that will help you attract and retain your clients with web, social and email content.

**Product Solutions**  
You will learn about our robust products and services that can help clients and their families achieve their financial goals.  
Together with its subsidiaries, New York Life provides a range of competitive insurance and financial products, including life insurance, annuities, long-term care insurance, disability income insurance, and investment products such as mutual funds through our broker-dealer, NYLIFE Securities LLC (member of FINRA and SIPC), a Licensed Insurance  
Agency. You will be required to hold securities licenses and FINRA registrations and affiliate with NYLIFE Securities as a registered representative before you can offer investment products.

**Your transition to a Field Manager role**  
After meeting specific requirements for the first 12 months as a financial professional, you will enter a specialized six-month Associate Partner training program. We’ll help you to lead and build your team of financial professionals.  
Throughout your career journey with New York Life, you’ll continue to have opportunities to grow and be promoted to increasingly senior levels of management.

**How we will compensate you**  
When you begin with New York Life as a financial professional, you will receive income that is performance-based.

If you meet the requirements and approvals to become an Associate Partner, you will receive a salary. The salary range for an Associate Partner is $60,000–$150,000 (in California, the salary range is $62,400–$150,000), plus you will be eligible for additional compensation related to the agents you recruit and develop (“R&Ds”). R&Ds are additional compensation that is designed to increase your income and to reimburse for any reasonable and necessary expenses we do not otherwise reimburse. You will also be eligible for medical, dental, and vision benefits, life, long-term disability, and accidental death and dismemberment coverages, a pension plan, and a 401(k) savings plan.

New York Life will value and reward your hard work and success. You’ll have significant income potential over time, because our field managers’ compensation is directly aligned with their recruiting performance and the production level of their team of financial professionals. The average income among our 586 recruiters at all levels in 2021 was $270,890.6

**About New York Life**

We have been in business for over 175 years, helping generations of Americans protect their families and attain their financial goals.

If you do not become a full-time agent, all commissions on any sales you made will be paid to you at the end of six months.
