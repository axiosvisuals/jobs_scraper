Pay minimum is $40 per class, paid as an independent contactor through zelle pay once per month. Most of our teachers teach 1-3 classes per week 1 hour per day (depending on schedule/availability).

Classes are immediately after school and on site at schools starting in September. **Most classes run from 3-4 pm and you would need to arrive by 2:30 pm or so on site. Occassionally schools book classes at 3:30 pm.** Please only apply if you have this time period available at least once or twice per week and factor in any commutes you may have.

These are the courses I currently have available (all with curriculum) :

Monday Public Speaking and Debate in Hoboken 9/30- 11/25 (no 10/14) Class runs from 3-3:45 but you must arrive by 2:30ish

Monday Legos in Jersey City 9/23-12/9 (no 10/14, 11/11) Class runs from 3:30- 4:30 but you must arrive by 3:10

Wednesday Soccer in Jersey City 9/25- 12/4 (no 11/27) Class runs from 3:30- 4:30 but you must arrive by 3:10

You must be able to commit to all dates.

Most of our classes/courses are 8 weeks long and run as trimesters, contingent on meeting minimum enrollment numbers to run. The classes above will all be running and have met minimums already. We share all school information and ask that you make sure all times, dates, subjects work for you before committing. We provide curriculum for our classes, but would prefer instructors who can enhance and adapt our curriculum. Pay is $40 per class for generalized classes (up to an hour of active teaching, though you are expected to arrive at least 20 minutes before start time with no teaching duties before class.) We pay higher for specialized classes like piano, guitar, dance, and ASL (where instructors may need to provide their own curriculum) and very experienced teachers.

Requirements:  
-**Must have NJDOE (New Jersey Department of Education) fingerprint clearance OR willingness to obtain ASAP (it's easy and we can nominate you. It is a prerequisite of employment- it does not expire)**   
-**afternoon availability to be on site at a Hudson County School around 2:30 pm. Most classes run from 3 until 4 pm with around an hour of active teaching time or around that time frame. Please let us know if you are also open to Hoboken, Jersey City, and/or Weehawken.**  
- **experience working with elementary aged group of students and love working with children**

**-professional- dependable, punctual, good classroom management, follow directions/curriculum plans and school rules, follow through on commitments**

This job is perfect for part time teachers, substitutes, retired educators, students, part time employees, etc. - basically anyone who has other things going on in their life where the time commitment availability for mid-afternoon teaching will not be a problem/conflict and who has other things going on in their life and could use extra cash.

**Please send a resume, a little blurb about yourself and note your availability for a short preliminary zoom interview. Please NO phone calls about the position- we will respond to all qualified, local candidates.**

If there is anything you would like us to consider you, please let us know (we require experience working with elementary aged student groups). Thank you for your interest in PAE.
