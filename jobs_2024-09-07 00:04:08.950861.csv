interpretation, and generally have significant policy and financial implications for the State. The Bureau, one of the
  

largest within the OAG, offers a diverse and stimulating practice with attorneys handling all phases of litigation from
  

inception through trial.


The Deputy Bureau Chief will be responsible for management and supervision of the LEPG’s extensive federal and state
  

court litigation docket. The Practice Group is comprised of three (3) Sections of managers, attorneys, and support staff
  

that principally represent and defend the State’s public safety agencies—including, among others, the Department of
  

Corrections and Community Supervision, State Police, Division of Criminal Justice Services, Division of Homeland

promulgated by their client agencies; labor and employment litigation emanating from their client agencies’ role as
  

employers; challenges to administrative decisions and determinations made by their client agencies under state law;
  

and civil rights litigation, such as First Amendment retaliation, Fourth Amendment excessive force or Fourteenth
  

Amendment due process claims, generated from their client agencies’ core functions. The LEPG also handles a number
  

of class actions and complex litigations concerning challenges to important governmental programs and policies in the
  

corrections and criminal justice fields.


The Deputy Bureau Chief will report to the Bureau Chief, and work closely with the Practice Group’s Section Chiefs and
  

Deputy Section Chiefs in supervising the work of approximately twenty-eight (28) attorneys and support staff. **Among**

* Evaluating and making recommendations on representation and settlement issues; and
* Regularly providing advice, training, and support to the Bureau’s attorneys and support staff.
**Suitable candidates must possess the following minimum qualifications:**  

• At least **ten (10) years** of civil litigation experience in federal and New York state courts, including some trial and/or


complex litigation experience;
  

* At least **three (3) years** of experience managing attorneys and/or staff;
* Superb legal analysis, legal writing and editing, and oral advocacy skills;
* Outstanding organizational, interpersonal communication, problem solving, and teamwork skills; and
* Excellent technological skills, including knowledge of and experience with various computer software programs and
case management and electronic discovery platforms.

* Significant prior civil jury trial experience in federal and New York state courts;
* Prior experience litigating, preferably through to trial, Section 1983 civil rights and employment litigation matters;

preliminary injunctions, including handling preliminary injunction hearings;
  

* Prior class action litigation experience, including experience with class certification motions and related issues; and
* Prior experience analyzing and resolving complex conflict of interest, representation, and indemnification issues.

**About Us:**



Warby Parker was founded with a mission: to inspire and impact the world with vision, purpose, and style.



We're constantly asking ourselves how we can do more and make a greater impact, and that starts by reimagining everything that a company and industry can be. We want to demonstrate that a business can scale while doing good in the world, without charging a premium for it. And we've learned that it takes creativity, empathy, and innovation to achieve that goal.



Since the day we launched in 2010, we've pioneered ideas, designed products, and developed technologies that help people see. We offer everything you need for happier eyes at a price that leaves you with money in your pocket, from designer-quality glasses and contacts to eye exams and vision tests, and you can meet us online, at our stores, or even in your home. Wherever and whenever you need it, we're there to make exceptional vision care simple and accessible. (Delightful, too.)



Ultimately, we believe in vision for all, which is why for every pair of glasses or sunglasses we sell, a pair of glasses is distributed to someone in need through our Buy a Pair, Give a Pair program.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Warby-Parker","http://www.warbyparker.com","New York","501 to 1,000","","Marby Parker was founded with a rebellious spirit and a lofty objective: to offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price, while leading the way for socially conscious businesses.","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/56f2123c26a1b1e8687851d8f0ef08d2","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_headerimage/1960x400/49ea419eaf79e3492df75cdfc33ccee7","Neil Blumenthal",""

Applicants must have some experience litigating employment law cases and a demonstrated commitment to addressing fundamental issues of poverty and justice.  



The Employment Law Unit provides legal services to low-wage and unemployed workers. Most of the Employment Law Unit’s cases involve violations of wage-and-hour laws, workplace discrimination, family and medical leave, labor trafficking, and claims for unemployment insurance. In its discrimination cases, ELU assists the most vulnerable New Yorkers who are sexually harassed, discriminated against based on race, national origin, immigration status, pregnancy, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, status as a domestic violence victim, or criminal background, or who are denied reasonable accommodations needed due to pregnancy or disabilities.  



The Employment Law Unit’s docket includes complex individual, group, and class cases in federal and state court and other forums, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the New York State Department of Labor. Our clients are overwhelmingly people of color living paycheck to paycheck.  



The Employment Law Unit’s multi-pronged approach to systemic problems allows it to magnify its impact beyond any one case to create more equitable conditions for workers and communities in New York City and throughout New York State. The Employment Law Unit engages in extensive policy and legislative advocacy, leading to changes that improve the lives of millions of low-income New Yorkers. In addition, the Employment Law Unit works with community organizations, conducting trainings on workers’ rights, providing legal advice and assistance, and responding to community concerns.  



Unlike any other legal services provider, due to its size and diverse practice areas, Legal Aid is able to provide in-house, holistic legal services. In many cases, the Employment Law Unit collaborates with Legal Aid’s Criminal Defense Practice, as well as other Civil units. For example, The Employment Law Unit works closely with the Immigration Law Unit to obtain immigration protection for workers, including U and T visas. This is important because undocumented workers are frequently exploited by unscrupulous employers.
