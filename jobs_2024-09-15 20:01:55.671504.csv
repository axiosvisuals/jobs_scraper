Uncommon Schools is a nonprofit network of high-performing, public charter schools providing an outstanding K-12 education in historically under-resourced communities. We have proudly built schools that reflect our student population, with more than 60% of our teachers and staff across our network identifying as a person of color. Uncommon currently manages 52 schools serving 19,000 students in five cities: Boston, Camden, New York City, Newark and Rochester. We are proud that Uncommon graduates persist in and graduate from college at five times the rate of their peers nationally. We achieve this by offering strong academic, co-curricular, and social-emotional learning that prepares students for success in college and beyond.


North Star Academy currently manages fourteen schools in Newark, NJ serving students in grades K through 12. We believe in strong authentic relationships between teachers and students, supported by effective school systems and an engaging instructional model that enables students to flourish academically and personally. North Star Academy is NJ's #1 highest performing public charter school and has served Newark families for over 20 years.

 **Job Description**  

As a nation, we have long struggled to provide equitable access to a high-quality education for all students, and the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic only served to exacerbate those systemic inequities. At the same time, the disruption and innovation of the last two years have opened the door to a new sense of possibility. Many students, school staff and system leaders have rightly called to use this moment not just to recover – but to reimagine and reinvent how we approach education.


High School students have been amongst the most vocal about what they want – more agency and flexibility, more high-interest and high-quality course choices, greater attention to their needs as whole children, and more intentionality about launching them successfully toward a diverse array of college and career options. Based on these themes, many system leaders have begun to craft an ambitious agenda to reinvent high school. Because of this need, North Star is partnering with Stepmojo to offer all students radically expanded access to high-interest, rigorous courses, exceptional teachers, and personalized college and career options. In order to deliver on this extraordinary opportunity, we need a team of on-the-ground coaches to support student learning.


The presence of technology alone is no guarantee that students will succeed. Strong, effective online learning doesn’t just happen. It requires the work of thoughtful, engaged staff who leverage the best of remote instruction and in-person scaffolds to address the unique learning needs of their students. Learning coaches will give an extra boost to the online learning experience. They will build affirming relationships with students, manage all in-person activities by circulating and encouraging students, entering attendance data daily and grade data weekly.

**Responsibilities:**

* **Manage the Classroom/Workspace Environment**
	+ Arrange and maintain a safe, structured, and effective learning environment
	+ Create a positive, achievement-oriented learning environment that excites and invests students (e.g., establish classroom routines and expectations, develop affirming relationships with students)
	+ Encourage students to engage and be active participants in their online course
	+ Troubleshoot minor technical issues (e.g., forgotten headphones, lost chargers)
* **Provide In-person Support for Students**
	+ Track and monitor student attendance – intervening if truancy occurs
	+ Notify school-site coordinator if attendance issues persist
	+ Serve as a thought partner to work through issues during independent work time
	+ Provide in the moment feedback to students regarding their participation in class – affirming and engaging students in the learning
	+ Connect students who are struggling behaviorally or academically with the appropriate StepMojo or North Star resources
	+ Conference with students’ family and academic advisor keeping everyone informed of the learning
	+ Serve as a mentor to students – establishing trusting relationships and providing active guidance throughout the course
* **Communication with the Online Instructor**
	+ Establish asynchronous check-in routines and procedures with each course instructor
	+ Share insights as to how students are engaging with the content (e.g., where they struggle, high points of interest, questions)
* **Provide Feedback to StepMojo and North Star**
	+ Meet with the implementation team for an initial orientation and onboarding session
	+ Collaborate with StepMojo and North Star staff to improve the pilot implementation
	+ Participate in periodic feedback sessions and ongoing trainin
* **General Responsibilities**
	+ Assist teachers with instruction, assessments, grading, and other classroom responsibilities;
	+ Potentially teach small groups of students;
	+ Support students by providing one-on-one and small group tutoring daily, and small group intervention and student support;
	+ Observe Master Teachers in order to improve instructional techniques and classroom management;
	+ Provide administrative support including but not limited to copies, hallway duty, organizing classroom materials, etc.
	+ As appropriate, perform all duties expected of staff, including but not limited to:
		- Participating in grade-level activities, and school-wide functions, events, and trips;

**Hours of Operation**



Full-time Monday through Friday with occasional weekend hours.

  


**Salary**



$60,000-80,000 plus commission plan

  


**DO MORE. BE MORE.**

**BE A REGIONAL SALES EXECUTIVE AT MOBILE HEALTH**

  



First things first — we’re not your normal business. Mobile Health is a healthcare and technology company with big ambitions. We look at each day with the energy and spirit of a start-up and an insatiable hunger to never stop doing great things.

  



That’s why we’ve been disrupting the occupational health industry since our beginning in 1984 and continue to do so with our game-changing technology and new approaches to meeting our clients’ pre-employment and compliance testing needs.

  




We’re expanding across the United States with more than 6,500 clinics, a mobile fleet, and the ability to deliver care on-site, at our client's doorstep. We’re changing the way companies think about employee health and safety. We work hard to create a world where occupational health and employee screeningare an open door to growth. Our dedication is real. You can feel the passion and enthusiasm. We break barriers. We’re the solution the industry desperately needs. We need great thinkers, activators, strategists, and managers who want to share in our passion to get things done.

  




Do we sound like the kind of company — and culture — you’re looking for? Are you in a sales role today and want to move on to do the best work of your life? If you’re ready to join us, we can’t wait to meet you. Read on to learn more about Mobile Health and our Regional Sales Executive role.

  


**STEP UP. STEP IN. OWN IT.**



As the CEO of your market, we expect you to engage in high-profile client relationships to execute your sales strategy. You are the driving force in a large territory and will be an integral part of our National Sales Team to deliver results. We’ll give you all the autonomy you could ever ask for, underpinned by the support you need to be successful. No micro-managers here — we want you to step up, step in, and own it.

  


**WHAT YOUR DAY WILL LOOK LIKE**



If you’re currently in a sales role — in any industry — you know that your day is all about finding opportunities where there’s an amazing marriage between what the client needs and what we have to offer. You’re advocating for your client, going to bat to find a great solution, and developing relationships with long-term value. That means your day looks like this:

  


* You’re developing a pipeline of opportunities based on a strategic territory plan and collaborating with leadership to support you.


* Reaching out and making friends, turning “no’s” into “yeses” and showing the company’s unique solutions tailored to our client’s needs.


* You’re a go-to, trusted expert. When the client says, “I’m not sure who can solve this?” you would be the first person they call.


* You’re a visible member of speaking panels, trade shows, conferences, and any other event where your community of prospects are meeting to talk.


* You love Salesforce so much you could cry. Well, maybe not, but you get the idea. You’ll be keeping Salesforce updates with all client and deal information.


* You’re preparing quotes, pricing, and assisting with RFIs or RFPs.

  


**CARE AND LOVE**



And we will take care of you. You’ll be working with colleagues who are passionate and driven to succeed. You’ll learn from the best. And we expect your best each day. We provide a generous compensation package, great benefits, a remote work environment, and everything you need to be successful. Did we mention an unlimited PTO policy? Technically, we call it our “responsible use” policy, meaning, don’t ruin it for everyone. We expect you to work hard. And we expect you to live your life.

  


**WHY DO WE NEED YOU?**



Mobile Health continues to grow. Rapidly. And the key to your success is our success. We think of our Sales Executives as the tip of the spear. Our Marketing Team will deliver you leads, and you’ll be hunting for them on your own. We can’t do this alone, which is why we need you to help us continue our growth. We’ll rely on you to create your own strategies and business plans to:

  


* Expand market share and adoption of our products and services within a specific territory.
* Be an advocate for Mobile Health and the great work we do every day.
* Build a sales pipeline that you’ll be proud of and will reward you with generous compensation.

  


**DOES THIS SOUND LIKE YOU?**



We want people who are skilled relationship developers, have an entrepreneurial spirit, and approach everything they do with passion. We’re looking for a respected professional who exhibits keen business instincts, is creative, and above all, can drive results. You could be a great fit if you have:

  


* A persuasive, energetic, independent operator mindset who can earn and retain a “seat at the table.”


* Strong planning skills to focus on an individual territory.


* Comfortable dealing with — and managing in — an extremely fluid, fast-paced environment (we don’t stop around here…. it’s a driving force of our company DNA)


* Amazing communication skills, optimism, and confidence

  


**SKILL SET vs. PRIOR EXPERIENCE**



We’re all about looking for the right people. If you have a go-getter, sales skillset, but have never worked in healthcare, that’s ok! We want you to apply! Sales Executives with a few years’ experience are great. If you believe in yourself, can show us what you’re made of, and feel inspired after reading this job post, then we want you to apply.

Facilitate the creation and implementation of patient-centered care plans by working closely with remote healthcare providers, specifically tailored to telemedicine frameworks.

Educate and support both patients and SNF staff on the effective use of telemedicine programs, promoting optimal management of chronic conditions and healthcare outcomes.



Advocate for the patient’s needs, ensuring they receive comprehensive and effective care through the telemedicine programs.



Bridge communication and operational gaps between SNF staff and the remote clinical team to ensure seamless delivery of telemedicine services.



Manage and maintain patient records, ensuring accurate and timely communication of health data between the SNF and the remote clinical team.



Monitor and evaluate patient progress within telemedicine programs, working collaboratively with all parties to adjust care plans and interventions for better health outcomes.


**Qualifications**



Certification as a Medical Assistant or in a related healthcare field.



Experience in telemedicine, RPM, or CCM programs, with a strong understanding of care coordination within these settings.



Demonstrated ability to communicate effectively and coordinate between patients, healthcare providers, and facility staff.



Strong organizational and multitasking skills, with the capacity to manage complex care programs and detailed patient data.



Proficiency in electronic medical records (EMR) and telemedicine platforms, with a high level of digital literacy.



Knowledgeable in medical terminology, chronic condition management, and the specific requirements of telemedicine care delivery.



Independent worker with team collaboration skills, committed to enhancing patient care and outcomes through effective telemedicine coordination.


**Ideal Candidate**



The ideal candidate is a dynamic and empathetic professional, skilled in navigating the nuances of telemedicine and adept at coordinating care between remote clinical teams and patients in SNFs. This role is perfect for someone passionate about leveraging technology to improve healthcare delivery and patient outcomes in a telemedicine setting.

  


**To Apply**: Please submit your resume and a cover letter that highlights your experience with telemedicine programs, specifically RPM and CCM, and your proficiency in care coordination within these frameworks.
