### **The Roku Culture**



Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We’re independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.



We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

The behavioral health care manager is responsible for coordinating and supporting mental health care within a clinical setting and for coordinating referrals to clinically indicated services outside the clinic. The behavioral health care manager may provide evidence-based treatments or work with other mental health providers when such treatment is indicated. This job description provides a comprehensive list of the duties and responsibilities required of a behavioral health care manager.

**JOB DESCRIPTION:** 

Part-Time Behavioral Health Care Manager (Collaborative Care Model)

Location: Long Island, NY (Senior Living Communities)

Position: Part-Time Behavioral Health Care Manager

Organization: Seniority Healthcare

Reports to: Clinical Director / Behavioral Health Director

Potential for Growth: This part-time role has the potential to transition into a full-time position with full benefits.

**Position Overview:**

We are seeking a compassionate and experienced Behavioral Health Care Manager to join our team in a part-time capacity. This role focuses on providing behavioral health support within a Collaborative Care Model for senior residents living in various Senior Living Communities throughout Long Island, NY. The ideal candidate will play a pivotal role in integrating behavioral health care into primary care settings and ensuring the mental well-being of seniors in our care.

The behavioral health care manager coordinates the overall effort of the group and ensures effective communication among team members. Behavioral health care managers are typically nurses, psychologists, social workers or licensed counselors, but the ability to perform the tasks that need to be completed and creating a tailored plan for who will do each of those tasks is much more important than one's credentials.

A behavioral health care manager is not the same as a case manager or a behavioral health consultant. A full-time behavioral health care manager typically oversees 100-150 patients, depending on how the program is structured. Effective behavioral health care managers support the Primary Care Physician/Clinician (PCP) in his/her role by coordinating treatment, providing proactive follow-up of treatment response, alerting the PCP when the patient is not improving, supporting medication management, and facilitating communication with the psychiatric consultant regarding treatment changes. They also offer brief counseling (using evidence-based techniques such as motivational interviewing, behavioral activation, and problem-solving treatment) and help facilitate changes in treatment if patients are not improving as expected.

**Key Responsibilities:**

Care Coordination: Serve as the primary point of contact for behavioral health needs, coordinating care between seniors and their respective families, primary care providers, community staff, and psychiatric consultants.

Assessments & Screenings: Conduct initial and follow-up behavioral health assessments, including standardized screenings (e.g., PHQ-9, GAD-7, MMSE, etc.).

Care Planning: Develop and implement individualized care plans in collaboration with the primary care team, psychiatric consultant,bgnh78 and senior residents.

Evidence-Based Interventions: Provide brief, evidence-based interventions (e.g., problem-solving therapy, behavioral activation) as appropriate for seniors in need of support.

Collaborative Consultation: Regularly consult with psychiatric providers to review cases, adjust care plans, and enhance the mental health outcomes of senior residents.

Outcome Monitoring: Track and document treatment progress and outcomes, ensuring timely follow-ups and adjustments in care plans.

Communication & Advocacy: Facilitate clear communication between residents, families, senior living community staff, and the care team regarding treatment plans, goals, and available resources.

Education & Training: Provide education to staff at senior living communities on recognizing behavioral health needs and when to refer residents for specialized care.

**Qualifications:**

Education: Master’s degree in social work, counseling, psychology, or a related behavioral health field.

Experience: Minimum of 2 years of experience in behavioral health care management, preferably in a primary care, geriatrics, or collaborative care setting.

Skills: Strong understanding of the Collaborative Care Model, excellent communication skills, and proficiency in behavioral health assessments and interventions.

Technology: Experience with electronic health records (EHR) and remote care coordination tools is preferred.

**Work Environment:**

This position requires traveling between different senior living communities within the Long Island area.

Flexible part-time hours, with the potential for growth into a full-time role based on performance and program expansion.

**Benefits:**

Competitive hourly wage.

Potential for transition to full-time employment with benefits including health insurance, retirement plan, paid time off, and continuing education support.

**How to Apply:**

Interested candidates should submit their resume and a cover letter detailing their experience and interest in this role to Seniority Healthcare with the subject line “Behavioral Health Care Manager Application.”

**ABOUT SENIORITY HEALTHCARE:**

Seniority Healthcare, a transformational evolution of CCS Healthcare, was born out of a visionary idea in 2016. Our founders were guided by a mission to revolutionize elderly care, with a focus on creating a more compassionate and comprehensive healthcare system for seniors, particularly those grappling with physical and mental disabilities.

Our founders observed that the rising senior population was underserved in the United States, with many individuals unfortunately falling through the healthcare system's gaps. These vulnerable individuals often experienced the harsh consequences of multiple hospitalizations, medical procedures, and a fragmented care system. This observation sparked a determination to effect a paradigm shift in senior healthcare.

To rectify this, we embarked on an ambitious journey to design a better healthcare delivery system for seniors. Our team developed a progressive care model that involved frequent primary care visits for patients managing multiple chronic diseases, supplemented by the convenience and immediacy of telehealth services.

In a significant milestone in 2018, we expanded our capabilities by integrating psychiatric services into our offerings. This strategic addition reinforced our commitment to holistic care, enabling us to cater not only to our patients' medical needs but also to their emotional well-being.

While we have an unwavering commitment to our patients, we also deeply care for the health and wellbeing of our team members. We firmly believe that the well-being of our staff directly translates to the quality of patient care. The existing healthcare landscape, dominated by corporations often prioritizing profits over patients, can sometimes strain the crucial relationship between the healthcare team and their patients. We aim to counter that trend.

At Seniority Healthcare, we champion a work culture that celebrates work-life balance and offers fair wages. We take pride in having accomplished this without any external investment, enabling us to stay true to our core mission: putting patients first, always.

Our reach extends to patients in Senior Living Communities and their homes, catering to their needs in the familiar comfort of their surroundings. We now serve patients across New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware, bringing our unique blend of care to their doorsteps. Our approach has significantly reduced the need for hospitalizations, providing patients the comfort and safety they deserve.

We are immensely proud of our unwavering dedication to our patients and their families. As we continue to grow, our commitment remains the same: To provide superior care that respects our patients' dignity and enhances their quality of life. Seniority Healthcare is not just a healthcare provider; it's a beacon of hope, a pledge of commitment, and a promise of care that enriches lives.

**Salary range:**$51,528.00 – $59,257.00**Job Description**

Established in 1805, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (the NYC Health Department) is the oldest and largest health department in the country. Our mission is to protect and improve the health of all New Yorkers, in service of a vision of a city in which all New Yorkers can realize their full health potential, regardless of who they are, how old they are, where they are from, or where they live.

As a world-renowned public health agency with a history of building transformative public health programming and infrastructure, innovating in science and scholarship to advance public health knowledge, and responding to urgent public health crises from New York City’s yellow fever outbreak in 1822, to the COVID-19 pandemic we are a hub for public health innovation, expertise, and programs, and services. We serve as the population health strategist, and policy, and planning authority for the City of New York, while also having a vast impact on national and international public policy, including programs and services focused on food and nutrition, anti-tobacco support, chronic disease prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, family and child health, environmental health, mental health, and racial and social justice work, among others.

Our Agency’s five strategic priorities, building off a recently-completed strategic planning process emerging from the COVID-19 emergency, are:  
1) To re-envision how the Health Department prepares for and responds to health emergencies, with a focus on building a “response-ready” organization, with faster decision-making, transparent public communications, and stronger surveillance and bridges to healthcare systems 2) Address and prevent chronic and diet-related disease, including addressing rising rates of childhood obesity and the impact of diabetes, and transforming our food systems to improve nutrition and enhance access to healthy foods  
3) Address the second pandemic of mental illness including: reducing overdose deaths, strengthening our youth mental health systems, and supporting people with serious mental illness  
4) Reduce black maternal mortality and make New York a model city for women’s health  
5) Mobilize against and combat the health impacts of climate change

Our 7,000-plus team members bring extraordinary diversity to the work of public health. True to our value of equity as a foundational element of all of our work, and a critical foundation to achieving population health impact in New York City, the NYC Health Department has been a leader in recognizing and dismantling racism’s impacts on the health of New Yorkers and beyond. In 2021, the NYC Board of Health declared racism as a public health crisis. With commitment to advance anti-racist public health practices that dismantle systems that perpetuate inequitable power, opportunity and access, the NYC Health Department continues to work in and with communities and community organizations to increase their access to health services and decrease avoidable health outcomes.

PROGRAM AND JOB DESCRIPTION:

The Division of Family and Child Health (DFCH) of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene is charged with the creation and oversight of programs, policies, services, and environments that support physical and socio-emotional health, and promote primary and reproductive health services, health equity, social justice, safety and well-being for New York City families and children. The Division is comprised of the Bureau of Maternal Infant and Reproductive Health, the Bureau of Early Intervention, the Office of School Health, and the Bureau of Administration. The vision of the DFCH is that every child, woman, and family recognize their power and is given the opportunity to reach their full health and development potential.
