### **What you’ll be doing…**


As a Lead member of the Network Planning Technology Standards team, you will be responsible for supporting the Core & Terminals network design from a Standards perspective. Ensuring 4G, 5G and Next Gen network Standards are defined and satisfy feature requirements and performance objectives. You will also be responsible for technology analysis and driving Verizon priorities, strategic interests and objectives. You’ll be analyzing and designing CT architecture layers (protocols, APIs, policy, interworking) that will optimize networks to support innovative applications. The 5G system and future networks will deliver demanding ultra-low latency, massive MTC connections and high throughput performance requirements to meet customer experience and evolve beyond. Therefore, you will be adept at developing relationships with external parties and influencing direction in industry bodies.

* Evaluating and authoring 3GPP technical contributions and driving Verizon positions and alignment with operators and vendors.
* Effectively collaborating with diverse minds on a Global Scale – The CT WGs have a dedicated group of participants and work on the Stage3 WI/SI aspects and engagements of all 3GPP Working Groups with these domain experts driving the technology discussions. This means interacting with Global partners and competitors equally in a supplier led environment while navigating geo-political influences and competitive strategies and tactics.
* Supporting the development of a 3+ year technology strategic view on Core/RAN, including Network Slicing, Voice, Mission Critical Services, IoT, V2X, MEC, AI, strategic Vertical enablement (Drones/UAV/Satellite), data and video. This includes effectively characterizing and summarizing the technical direction of industry activity to inform various stakeholders and leadership (formally and ad hoc).

* Serving as a mentor and guide to other delegates and SMEs to increase technical competency and knowledge of navigating the Standards process.
