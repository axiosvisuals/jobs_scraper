**Position Summary**  

  

The Structural Biology team at BMS uses X-ray crystallography and Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM) to determine high-resolution 3D structures of biological macromolecules. Both techniques are vital for structure-based drug design, but Cryo-EM has notable advantages over X-ray crystallography. It can solve structures of larger proteins and protein complexes, and unlike X-ray crystallography, is less stringent regarding protein purity and quantity. Crystallization of protein is not required for Cryo-EM, which eliminates one big uncertainty. During this internship, our focus will be on Cryo-EM, specifically purifying proteins for this method and optimizing the sample preparation workflow.  

  

The project involves expressing the target proteins in bacterial and/or eukaryotic systems and purifying them using highly selective affinity chromatography. Following initial purification, the proteins will be characterized with available biophysical methods and prepared for Cryo-EM analysis, which will be carried out using on-site Titan Krios electron microscope. Data obtained on microscope will be analyzed with CryoSPARC software and used for structure determination.  

  

**Key Responsibilities*** Protein expression in bacterial and/or mammalian cells
* Protein purification using affinity, size exclusion, ion exchange chromatography
* Protein characterization using biophysical methods
* Preparation of samples for cryo-electron microscope
* Cryo-electron microscope operation, sample screening, analysis and data collection
* 3-dimensional structure determination theory

**Qualifications & Experience*** Completed at least two years of undergraduate coursework at a university
* Strong analytical and organizational skills
* Excellent communication, collaboration and learning skills
* Preferred majors: Chemistry, Biochemistry, Biophysics, Biology
* Basic understanding of protein biochemistry
* Basic lab technique skills
