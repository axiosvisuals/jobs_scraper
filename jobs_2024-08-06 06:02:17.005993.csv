ESPA has two core activities: managing our reputation by engaging with our stakeholders and delivering great spaces and services to colleagues and clients.  

  

**We provide you with the knowledge and skills you need to succeed.**  

  

All ESPA Associates participate in a comprehensive training program in July and August. Training begins with a Citi orientation followed by technical training and soft skills training including presentation skills, communication skills and leadership skills. This training will facilitate the ability to immediately contribute to their initial rotation.


The Program will provide Associates with on-the-job-training in one of our many ESPA teams, including:  

  

* Community Investing & Development
* Global Communications
* Enterprise In-Business Reputation Risk Management (IBRRM)
* ESPA CAO (Chief Administrative Office)
* ESG & Sustainability
 **Your time here will look something like this.**


The ESPA program offers two one-year rotations and upon successful completion of the 24-month program, Associates may be considered for off-program placement in Citi ESPA. In both rotations, Associates will have an opportunity to broaden skill sets, develop analytical skills, increase knowledge in different disciplines, build professional networks and leadership capabilities. This rotation process helps Associates develop a solid knowledge base and broad range of skills while preparing them to take on future leadership roles in Citi espa. Success in the Rotational program is a solid first step towards a successful career at Citi. Throughout the program, participants will accelerate their learning and contribute to ESPA priorities by gaining experiences through rotations and placements:

* Associates are placed in a specific role within one of the ESPA disciplines. For prior summer participants, the rotation is typically in a new discipline to maximize development opportunities. During each rotation, participants work closely with management teams and are provided the opportunity to add value to Citi through various responsibilities.
* The goal of the rotational program is to help broaden skills, knowledge of the organization and expand networks.


  

**We want to hear from you if…**  

  

* You have an interest in any of the ESPA functions above and you are ready to learn and discover
* You are pursuing a MBA or Master’s degree and will graduate between December 2024 and June 2025 and you have 3-5 years of significant relevant full-time professional work experience
* It is preferred that you currently have a GPA of 3.3 or above
* You will not require sponsorship for U.S. work authorization now or anytime in the future


  

**Who we think will be a great fit…**  

  

We’re looking for motivated individuals, who are eager to start their careers, naturally curious, and interested in business. If you have a knack for problem solving and you enjoy brainstorming creative ideas and consulting, Citi is the right place for you! We value diversity and so do you.

Any information I provide in this application will be submitted only to the independent franchisee, who is the only company responsible for employment matters at this restaurant.
