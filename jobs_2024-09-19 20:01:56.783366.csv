Reporter, Financial Regulation, New York



The Wall Street Journal is looking for an enterprising and well-sourced reporter to cover financial regulation and how it protects — or fails to protect — consumers.



The U.S. financial system is a sprawling network of banks, exchanges, asset managers and payment networks. It is governed by a mishmash of federal, state and local regulators. The importance of that matrix was on display in 2023 when three U.S. banks failed in rapid succession, catching their regulators off guard and sparking fears of a 2008-style meltdown.



We’re looking for a reporter who can help our readers understand the complicated interplay between regulator and regulated, and how their actions affect consumers. We need someone who can break news about proposals regulators are considering and how financial institutions are responding to them.



The person should also be a watchdog for consumers, breaking news on novel financial products, highlighting fees and risks and helping set the conversation about where regulation is working and failing.



There’s much ground to cover, and the stakes are high. Last year’s turmoil exposed cracks in the banking business model, especially among the thousands of community banks Americans rely on.



The ideal candidate is deeply familiar with the inner workings of financial markets and the political dynamics that influence the regulatory environment. We also need a sharp writer skilled at finding creative ways to bring complex concepts alive through colorful and deeply reported stories. A desire to collaborate with colleagues in different coverage areas is a must.



You will:



+ Break news on the regulatory actions of the biggest financial firms



+ Distill complex financial concepts into language that’s easy to grasp for everyday consumers



+ Source across the regulatory landscape, consumer groups and lenders



+ Find the darker corners and hidden maneuvers of financial firms, big and small



You have:



+ Willingness and ability to study, understand and get excited about difficult topics in finance and regulation



+ Sharp reporting instincts and strong writing skills



+ A keen attention to detail and obsession with accuracy



The position is based in New York and reports to Wall Street Editors Cara Lombardo and David Benoit.



Reasonable accommodation: Dow Jones, Making Careers Newsworthy – We are an equal opportunity employer and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, pregnancy, age, national origin, disability status, genetic information, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law.EEO/AA/M/F/Disabled/Vets.

***About Urban Decay:***

Urban Decay was born in Southern California in 1996, when we disrupted the industry’s sea of pink-dominated counters. Badass cruelty-free, high-performance makeup. Reinvention over perfection. Inspiration without replication. Kindness over cruelty. Unsubscribe from beauty telling you to be pretty. Be whatever you want to be. PRETTY DIFFERENT.

 ***About Kiehl’s:***


Founded in 1851 as an old-world apothecary, Kiehl’s story began serving patrons homeopathic and herbal remedies at the corner of 13TH Street and Third Avenue, New York. But it wasn’t until 1894, when pharmacist John Kiehl took over the apothecary and transformed it into Kiehl’s Pharmacy. The brand has been changing the face of the skin industry for 170+ years and not running out of steam anytime soon. It’s celebrated for its scientifically backed blends that are developed in collaboration with an advisory panel of leading dermatologists, this range targets and tackles specific skin concerns and beauty woes.  



  

***About IT Cosmetics:***Founded in 2008 by Jamie Kern Lima, a TV news anchor who was unable to find products that solved her beauty concerns, including sparse brows and sensitive, rosacea-prone skin. Feeling overlooked by the beauty industry challenged Jamie’s confidence, but it also inspired her journey as an entrepreneur. She partnered with plastic surgeons and dermatologists to develop skincare-based, problem-solving makeup, and disrupted the industry by showing remarkable “Before & Afters” on real women with real skin concerns, women who deserved to feel confident and beautiful in their own skin. As IT Cosmetics continues to grow, so does our mission: to serve all people with products that are truly innovative and work in order to make the dream of confidence a reality.

The company’s “IP Led Transformations” vision, strategy, and business model are based on insights from a recent global study spanning 20+ industries and 5000+ companies worldwide.


Trianz believes that companies around the world face three challenges in their digital transformation journeys - shrinking ‘time to transform’ due to competition & AI, lack of digital-ready talent, and uncertain economic conditions. To help clients leapfrog over these challenges, Trianz has built IP and platforms that have transformed the adoption of the cloud, data, analytics & insights AI.


Specifically, the following Trianz platforms are changing the way companies approach transformations in various disciplines:


* **Concierto****:** A fully automated platform to Migrate, Manage, and Maximize the multi & hybrid cloud. A zero code and SaaS platform, Concierto allows teams to migrate to AWS, Azure and GCP and manage them efficiently from a single pane of glass. Visit www.concierto.cloud for more information.
* **Extrica** **Data to AI Platform:** Built on the concept of ‘federated or distributed data’, Extrica revolutionizes how users access data anywhere in the company’s ecosystems; productizes data and makes it available in a Netflix like user experience while delivering BI and AI powered insights. Visit www.extrica.io for more.
* **Pulse:** Recognizing that workforces will be distributed, mobile, and fluid, Trianz has built a ‘future of work’ digital workplace platform called Pulse. Visit www.trianz.com/Pulse


Since the market launch of this strategy in mid-2023, Trianz has experienced enormous growth, success and recognition.

* Some of Trianz’ built IP in data and analytics was acquired by Amazon. Since then, Trianz has been made an engineering partner of Amazon for building/supporting connected ecosystems across multiple AWS platforms.
* Trianz Concierto cloud platform and Extrica Datamesh are gaining traction, winning over 2 dozen customers with 50+ customers and partners in the queue.
* As an AWS Premier level qualified partner, Trianz is building and delivering platforms and services that are disrupting industry value propositions.


At a time when the services industry is struggling with its ability to deliver value at a pace that Trianz demands, Trianz’ “IP Led Digital Transformation Services” business model and value proposition are changing the game for companies and cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, and GCP. Rated #1 by clients in value delivery 5 years in a row, Trianz will surpass industry growth rates by a wide margin in the coming years.


Trianz is led by Sri Manchala, a former special forces officer from the Indian army and author on digital leadership (Crossing the Digital Faultline | Trianz), and a team of veterans from well-known firms such as Deloitte, HCL, KPMG, Wipro, Microsoft, AWS, GE, etc.


Given its above industry growth and demands, Trianz has recently raised private equity capital to scale the company over the next several years (Trianz Announces Strategic Growth Capital Investment by Capital Square Partners (prnewswire.com). Trianz is now seeking to bolster its senior and mid-level leadership with top talent across GTM, Engineering, Services, and Partnership organizations. We are seeking leaders driven by our purpose - to help accelerate digital transformations - and motivated to change the way our industry delivers value.
