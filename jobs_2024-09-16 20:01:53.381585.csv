The students in our Early Childhood program are from many different cultural backgrounds and we are interested in hiring diverse and less-represented applicants.

An Early Childhood assistant supports the programming and direction of the class teacher. We seek to develop as much independence as possible in a child at any age and the class teacher will show how this is implemented. We work to redirect behavior and not give commands unless it is absolutely necessary and teachers model this way of leading a class. This is done through singing and soft reminders which become integral to the class rituals.

Our program for children is indoor for free play and building, shared meals, creative projects, circle time, and rest time. We have outdoor play yards for each class with a tent and play areas. Our school has a biodynamic garden and a CSA farm next door, which are destinations for walks, as well as our 20 acres that includes woods and a creek. An Early Childhood assistant must be open to being outdoors and taking long walks. Other responsibilities are cooking, setting up naps, overseeing rest time, and supervising in the play yard.

Galileo is a team-based medical practice working to improve the quality and affordability of health care for all. Operating across 50 states, Galileo offers high-touch, data-driven, multi-specialty, longitudinal care to diverse and complex patients—on the phone, in the home, and everywhere in between. Regional and national health plans, employers, and Fortune 500 organizations trust Galileo as the leading solution to improve population health. Founded by Dr. Tom X. Lee, the healthcare pioneer behind One Medical and Epocrates, Galileo is a team of leading innovators from healthcare, technology, and human-centered design. Our mission is to apply that talent and scientific thinking to transform society by solving our largest, toughest healthcare problems, while at the same time bringing patient and provider closer.

### **About the Role:**



Galileo is looking for a primary care Nurse Practitioner or Physician Assistant with strong clinical experience in complex care and an interest in improving health outcomes for those who need it the most. Unlike in traditional practices, at Galileo you'll be given the time and tools necessary to truly solve patient issues in a proactive manner, work with an excellent team of multi-disciplinary experts, and be at the frontier of modern medicine.


**Here's what you'll do:**



Direct Patient Care


* Act as a key PCP on our clinical team, which provides exceptional care to cohorts of Medicare and Medicaid patients.
* Deliver primary care in a patient-centric and provider-centric model - in the home, in the clinic, and through virtual visits. The scope of care includes preventive health, chronic disease management, urgent care, and transitions of care
* Collaborate, and partner across care team members including social work, behavioral health, virtual urgent care and triage, and clinical sub-specialists.
* Present patients during complex care rounds and solicit interdisciplinary feedback in formulating effective care plans.
* Educate patients on their health conditions and develop care and treatment plans.


Patient Advocacy


* Advocate for seamless coordination of care among individuals involved in your patients' lives across the care continuum, within the home and within the community to ensure the best outcomes for patients.
* Identify and help to address any financial, social, environmental or functional barriers to care or better health


Population Health


* Take proactive ownership of population health outcomes - hospital/ED admissions/readmissions, quality metrics, and patient satisfaction
* Drive ongoing improvements for our care model, optimizing outcomes while decreasing inefficiency
* Conduct follow-up visits with patients post-hospital discharge to assess their recovery progress, ensure adherence to discharge instructions, and address any ongoing medical needs or concerns


**Travel Requirements**: This role will require in-person care supporting our patients located in the Bronx and Long Island City in New York, one day per week. As part of this role, you will be providing direct patient care in patients' homes, from a mobile clinic or virtually. There is a requirement from our HQ at least twice a week on a monthly basis. The rest of the time, you'll be working remotely.


**Physical Requirements:** The employee must be able to meet the following requirements with or without reasonable accommodation(s):


* This position requires the ability to stand, sit, and walk for extended periods of time
* Ability to lift and carry objects weighing up to 20 pounds
* The job involves frequent bending, reaching, and kneeling to perform various tasks


**Compensation:** The annualized salary is $148,000-$170,000


### **About You****:**



You are a Primary Care Provider with extensive clinical experience. You are comfortable with complex clinical and social needs and eager to care for patients both in a community environment as well as within the home. You are driven to create systems that enable personalized, empathetic care for individuals and families in the community and eager to find a modern practice that supports approaching patient care in ways that make meaningful and real impact to their lives.


**We would love to hear from you if you have the following or equivalent experience:**


* 2+ years of clinical experience in complex care, chronic care, and primary care
* Innovative and creative leadership qualities
* Proven experience with successful behavior modification
* Comfort with basic procedural skills
* Ability to travel across assigned territory for patient visits
* Completed an accredited NP or PA program with certification to practice
* Active licensure in NY or ability to obtain license by start date with Galileo

This means your application will be reviewed by the franchisee who will make any hiring decisions. If hired, the franchisee will be your employer and is alone responsible for any employment related matters.  

  

At KFC, we feed the world. But we do more than fill people up. We fulfill their life. Our meals matter, and when we serve them with southern hospitality, we make our customer's day. So our jobs are more than a paycheck - they're about being independent, having fun, and making new friends.  

  

As a Team Member, you could be the smiling face that greets and serves customers. Or you could be the cook that prepares our world famous chicken (and tell your friends you know the ""secret"" - just kiddin'). Whatever job you do, you know what you do matters - to your team and to your customers.  

  

**Requirements:**  

  

The good news is that your training will teach you everything you need to know to succeed on the job. But there are a few skills you should have from the get-go:  

  

* You're a fun and friendly person who values customers and takes absolute pride in everything you do.


- You like talking - a lot - even to strangers (despite what your Mom told you). This is important, because you're not able to text message customers.
  

- You've got attitude - the right kind of course - and understand the need to be on time, all the time. With loads of energy, you understand that work is easier - and more fun - working as a team.  

* And you're at least 16 years old.

  

Keep in mind, this is just basic information. You'll find out more after you apply. And independently-owned franchised or licensed locations may have different requirements.

Overview of School
  
  

Founded in 1921 by Elisabeth Irwin (a contemporary and colleague of John Dewey, Caroline Pratt, and Lucy Sprague Mitchell), The Little Red School House has been at the vanguard of pedagogical innovation since its founding. LREI's goal is to educate students to become independent thinkers and lifelong learners and to pursue academic excellence and individual achievement, in a context of respect for others and service to the community. We believe that learning should be active and experiential, with the school providing abundant opportunities for students to excel. We accept students with a range of abilities and talents who can take full advantage of a rich and demanding academic program in which each student is both challenged and supported. We seek to create within the school a community built on understanding and respecting others. Thus, our student body traditionally reflects the racial and cultural diversity of our city, and our curriculum is built on interdisciplinary studies to promote understanding of many cultures. While individual achievement is encouraged and rewarded, our program underscores the value of shared goals, friendship, and cooperation in mastering difficult tasks. The progressive ideals that in 1921 gave life and inspiration to the school — academic excellence and creativity, active learning and innovative teaching, respect for the individual and responsibility to the community - continue to guide the school today. LREI is located in vibrant Greenwich Village and classes venture forth often to use the neighborhood and the city to provide rich learning experiences.
  
  

**Salary Range:**  

A range of $18,930 to $22,224 for the time period covered based on % of year worked.
