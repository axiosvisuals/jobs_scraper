Most financial services companies are looking to fill a quota. By doing so, they often wind up recruiting the wrong talent. Once they recruit a full group of new “agents”, their intellectual and financial capital must be spread across their entire recruiting class.

The most important part of every small business owner’s career can be the first few years their business is open. Why? Because most businesses fail in the first few years. But the ones that survive, can provide services for a lifetime. In financial services, having a solid mentor can be the difference maker in a young advisor’s career.

The Financial Advisor role provides the opportunity for hands-on experience with high net worth individuals on a daily basis. Couple that with the fast-paced nature of the tri-state area and you have a crash course in high quality customer service that can only be found on a top advisor team. As experience with your clientele grows, the Financial Advisor role will translate those acquired skills into their own growing practice. The end result: you’ll learn how to work with high net worth individuals before you approach your first high net worth individual.

“Build your practice on a top advisor team, helping manage a top advisor’s practice.”

Duties of the role:

* Design mutual fund portfolio models
* Research and implement market strategies for high net worth individuals
* Search for new business opportunities within a top advisor’s book
* Constant support and training in the language of financial services
* Build your own practice with the support of a team and industry leaders

Qualifications

* Strong interpersonal skills and customer service focus
* Market development/networking abilities
* Presentation and organizational skills
* Strong work ethic, self-motivated and goal-oriented
* BA, BS, and/or graduate degree or equivalent work experience required
