**Your New Role…**


The Multiplatform Editor is a best-in-class shaper and sharpener of stories and ideas. This is a role for a seasoned editor who has a nose for business news and a knack for helping writers elevate their work from good to great and help video and on-air reporters humanize business stories for a consumer audience. The ideal candidate thrives on the breakneck pace of deadline journalism, has top-notch news judgment and must love business news - with a particular enthusiasm for contextualizing complex financial news topics for a broad consumer audience. This person is a strong collaborator who can help shape CNN’s business reporting and work across multiplatform content teams to oversee business coverage.

**Your Role Accountabilities…**

* Edit breaking business news stories starting in the US afternoon hours and throughout the evening and early night

* Help reporters craft multiplatform stories that can be told on air, video, audio and digital text.
* Edit stories that explain complex financial information to a general news audience.
* Shape story ideas and angles around complex topics. When a big story breaks, editors are often the point person to launch the first URL, keeping us sharp and fast on breaking news.
* Serve as a second set of eyes on alerts or on key pieces that need a good comb-through and/or creative punch.
* Serve as a partner to writers in identifying distinctive angles on top stories, and in helping to make good stories great.
* CNN editors must be excellent communicators and diplomats. They are excellent providers of feedback who help elevate CNN’s storytelling across a wide range of platforms.
* A critical component of the job will be assisting with the live stories that are an essential part of our breaking news coverage.
* Be skeptical, but not cynical – be genuinely excited by the changes and disruptions to the US economy and beyond, but also ready to take a critical look at why those changes are taking place.
* And last but never least: Editors are often the final step before a story goes to CNN’s programming team to get distributed to millions of people worldwide; all news editors work intently to make sure our stories are accurate and fair so that we continue to grow the trust between CNN and our audiences.

**Qualifications & Experience…**

* 4+ years of digital experience
* College degree or equivalent industry experience
* Strong knowledge of or passion for business and financial news

==========================


Tandem is a generational opportunity to rethink how we bring new therapies to market, and our path to doing so is significantly de-risked – we have:

* **Exponential organic growth:** We have product-market fit and are growing rapidly through word-of-mouth. Tandem supports thousands of patients every week and is doubling physician user count every month. We will reach millions by 2025.
* **An AI-first business model:** Our approach is distinctly enabled by AI, but our business will get stronger (not commoditized) as foundation models improve. We are building durability through two-sided network effects that will compound over time.
* **Top tier investors:** With the traction to support conviction in our model, we raised significant funding from investors (including Thrive Capital, General Catalyst, and Bain Capital Ventures) to build an exceptional team of engineers and operators.

**Our number one problem is scaling to meet demand**. We are looking for individuals who are high horsepower, high throughput, and hyper resourceful to help us increase capacity and grow. We move fast and need to move faster.

**About the role**
------------------


What we’re doing is super complex, both in terms of business context and the tech required. It requires understanding the intricacies of health insurance rules, archaic healthcare systems, and what makes experiences effective for patients, providers, and pharmacies. In this role on our team, you’ll need to become deeply familiar with all of the above to deploy across the company on problem solving.


This is the kind of role which involves constantly learning new things. You will help us define our operational processes and inform our product design. Your work will directly support patients and their providers with their prescriptions, figuring out how to most efficiently get them their medication. You’ll build an appreciation for all the different challenges an early-stage company faces, as well as become super well-versed in US healthcare.

**If you join, you will:**
--------------------------

* Become an expert in the world of medication access, ranging from how every relevant type of health insurance process works to how GoodRx coupons work under the hood
* Own problems/outcomes from start to finish across the following areas:


	+ Our approach to provider partnerships (outreach through implementation) across a wide range of organization types
	+ Our core operations for processing prescriptions end-to-end and handling inbound/outbound engagement
	+ Our plans for expanding to and scaling across a wide range of specialties, geographies, and insurance situations
* Collaborate with the rest of our team and CEO to prioritize business goals as we balance supporting patients with building a long-term profitable business
* Explore and evaluate new opportunities (both internal and external) for the company

**We’ll be most excited if you:**
---------------------------------

* Have significant experience in a role that requires analytical problem solving, operational rigor, and outcome ownership (e.g., fast-growing startup, finance, consulting, core member of a 0 -> 1 business line at a high-performing organization)
* Know how to deal with ambiguous problems
* Know how to work with complex data
* Are pragmatic and can see the bigger picture
* Are high output and bias towards action


This is a list of ideal qualifications for this position. If you don't meet every single one of them, you should still consider applying! We’re excited to work with people from underrepresented backgrounds, and we encourage people from all backgrounds to apply.

**Working with us**
===================


Tandem is based in New York, with our full team working out of a beautiful and spacious office in SoHo.


We run as a high-trust environment with high autonomy, which requires that everyone is super competent and operates in line with our principles:

* **Commit to audacity.** ""Whether you think you can, or you think you can't – you're right.”
* **Do the math.** Be rigorous, assume nothing.
* **Find the shortest path.** Use hacks, favors, and backdoors. Only take a longer road on purpose.
* **Spit it out.** Be direct, invite critique, avoid equivocation – we want right answers.
* **Be demanding and supportive.** Expect excellence from everyone and offer help to achieve it.
* **Do what it takes to be number 1.** We work hard to make sure we win.

**We provide competitive compensation with meaningful equity.** Everyone who joins early will be a major contributor to our success, and we reflect this through ownership and pay.

**We also provide rich benefits to ensure you can focus on creating impact:**

* Fully covered medical, vision, and dental insurance.
* Memberships for One Medical, Talkspace, Teladoc, and Kindbody.
* Unlimited paid time off (PTO) and 16 weeks of parental leave.
* 401K plan setup, FSA option, commuter benefits, and DashPass.

*Our salary ranges are based on paying competitively for our company’s size and industry, and are one part of the total compensation package that also includes equity, benefits, and other opportunities at Tandem. Individual pay decisions are ultimately based on a number of factors, including qualifications for the role, experience level, skillset, geography, and balancing internal equity.*

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington).

Like Google's own ambitions, the work of a Software Engineer goes beyond just Search.

Operating with scale and speed, our exceptional software engineers are just getting started - and as a manager, you guide the way.  

  

With technical and leadership expertise, you manage engineers across multiple teams and locations, a large product budget and oversee the deployment of large-scale projects across multiple sites internationally.

* Please briefly describe why you think you would be a good fit for this job and why you are applying. And please be honest; it's totally okay if it's just for the paycheck, as long as you can still put your best foot forward and give your best to each task :)

--------------


UN Women, grounded in the vision of equality enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, works for the elimination of discrimination against women and girls; the empowerment of women; and the achievement of equality between women and men as partners and beneficiaries of development, human rights, humanitarian action and peace and security.


Violence against women and girls (VAWG) is among the most pervasive and serious violations of human rights, with inextricable links to broader peace and security. Spotlight Initiative was launched in 2017 as the world’s largest effort to end violence against women and girls. A pooled fund of the United Nations (UN) system, Spotlight Initiative is an SDG Accelerator, a United Nations High Impact Initiative to deliver on the 2030 Agenda and a model for localization, unifying communities, civil society, governments, donors, and experts under a common approach rooted in local needs. Spotlight Initiative is also a model for operationalizing the UN Development System reforms.


Spotlight Initiative has over 6 years, delivered proof of concept across 25 countries and 5 regions and will now scale up to greater investment and reach, bringing on board new countries and new partnerships. The Initiative will deepen its ""whole-of-society"" approach, placing the goal of ending violence against women and girls at the centre of national development priorities. Spotlight Initiative promotes a multi-sectoral approach to the complex issue of violence against women and girls and its variety of root causes. The Initiative's workstreams include four main pillars: 1. Laws, policies, and institutions; 2. Prevention and social norms change; 3. Response and services for survivors and perpetrators’ accountability; and 4. Support to civil society and women’s movements.


Under the leadership of the Executive Office of the UN Secretary-General, the day-to-day management of the Spotlight Initiative is led by a Secretariat, housed within the Development Coordination Office (DCO) with a reporting line to the Executive Office of the Secretary-General and servicing the whole UN System.


The Secretariat's core technical responsibilities are to support the design, implementation, and monitoring of comprehensive and effective country programmes on EVAWG, to contribute to increased global awareness, knowledge sharing, and networking on EVAWG as well as to ensure that the achievements and results of the Spotlight Initiative are expanded and sustained. Specifically, the Secretariat is responsible for the following outputs: 1) data and research on GBV and various forms of violence at the global and regional levels is enhanced and disseminated; 2) technical package in line with the Spotlight Initiative model, and evidence-based strategies, knowledge, and tools on violence against women and girls is consolidated and made available for new programmes and advocacy purposes; 3) global and regional strategic partnerships are expanded to advance efforts on ending gender-based violence, including through communication, behavior change strategies, events, and campaigns; and 4) increased expertise at country level to ensure the development and sustainability of comprehensive programmes to end violence against women and girls in line with the Spotlight Initiative model.


Six years into implementation, Spotlight Initiative has generated a wealth of knowledge, lessons, and best practices on integrated and comprehensive programming on ending violence against women and girls. Thus, a critical function of Spotlight Initiative is to serve as a knowledge platform on ending VAWG (EVAWG). Moving forward, Spotlight Initiative will amplify the wealth of lessons and promising practices generated by programmes to inform global policy and advocacy on EVAWG and serve as a model for comprehensive EVAWG programming.

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/U--haul","http://www.uhaul.com/","2727 North Central Avenue
