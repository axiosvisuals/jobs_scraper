TED is a global community, welcoming people from every discipline and culture who seek a deeper understanding of the world. We believe passionately in the power of ideas to change attitudes, lives and, ultimately, the world. On TED.com, we're building a clearinghouse of free knowledge from the world's most inspired thinkers — and a community of curious souls to engage with ideas and each other, both online and at TED and TEDx events around the world, all year long.

  

In fact, everything we do — from our Conferences to our TED Talks to the projects sparked by The Audacious Project, from the global TEDx and TED Translators communities to the TED-Ed lesson series — is driven by this goal: How can we best spread great ideas?  

TED is owned by a nonprofit, nonpartisan foundation. Our agenda is to make great ideas accessible and spark conversation.

 **Job Description**  

We're looking for **recent college graduates** who are media savvy, committed to fighting misinformation, can articulate well-formed editorial/programming opinions, and complete meticulous technical tasks. **You need to feel a personal stake in the future of science, health, technology, innovation, and demonstrate qualifications in one or two of those fields.**


Your primary mission will be to evaluate, optimize, and publish science, health, and technology-oriented talks put forward by the TEDx community. **This requires a scrupulous and discerning eye. This also requires a methodical and highly organized approach to work.** Globally, the TEDx initiative produces 500+ talks every week; we need smart people to watch each one to ensure it falls within established guidelines, as well as identify the best and most urgent ideas to share with a wider public. It's not as simple as you might think-there will be long hours watching video after video on a computer screen while you struggle to keep a clear-headed appreciation of our mission. We've been there. But if you love learning and sharing your opinion, it can be very rewarding. Your input will help guide not just the talks that we feature on TED.com, but our TEDx platforms as well.


A few skills you can expect to practice or learn: how to screen content and ensure it falls within established guidelines; how to research and fact-check content for video and audio formats; how to optimize a video for discovery on the internet; how to be an ambassador of the TEDx ethos; how to express a compelling opinion that leads to action; how best to contribute in a collaborative, opinionated workplace; what makes a great TED talk (and what makes a talk fail).

**We are looking for someone with a specific focus, passion for, and deep knowledge of a field related to science.** This could include, but is not limited to, artificial intelligence, health related sciences, astronomy, engineering, or environmental sciences. In addition to evaluating the credibility, novelty, and quality of scientific ideas, concepts, and innovations, you should be comfortable discerning ideas worth spreading from those that need further peer review.

  

This is a full-time 6-month paid internship with an hourly rate of $22. This position is open to US-based remote workers.

 **Qualifications**  

Requirements:

* Completed bachelor's degree
* You must be able to work 5 full days (40 hrs) per week, 10-6pm EST
* You will need a stable WiFi connection given that this internship will be remote work from home.
* You should be well-versed in the YouTube Creator Studio and very familiar working in Google Drive in spreadsheets and documents
* You should have an interest and experience in a broad range of scientific subjects
* You should have a research background in your field of expertise and feel comfortable reviewing peer-reviewed scientific literature across disciplines
* You must be detail-oriented and perceptive when completing tasks, and you must be able to work independently and efficiently
* You should possess a strong understanding of ethical reporting standards and practices-and be able to identify factual errors and logical flaws in examining sources
* You should possess excellent writing skills and be able to pass a short writing test
* You must be fluent in English


Additional preferred skills:

* Fluency in one other language is preferred, but not required
* College level coursework in science, technology, or engineering

 **Additional Information** **To apply,** please submit your resume, **a cover letter telling us why you’d like to join our team**, and what your favorite TEDx talk is. Please include links to a writing sample, i.e., something intelligent you've said online, a paper you’ve done for school or an article you've written. Demonstrate that you are bright, perceptive, succinct, and insightful.

**Please submit your cover letter in the ""Message to Hiring Manager"" section of the application or in a PDF attachment.**

**Incomplete applications will not be considered.**

About Clarks
  
Clarks, based in Somerset, England, has been at the forefront of innovative shoemaking since its foundation in 1825, when brothers James and Cyrus Clark made a slipper from sheepskin off-cuts. At the time it was ground-breaking: a combination of invention and craftsmanship that has remained at the heart of what the brand does now. In the Clarks archive of more than 22,000 pairs are shoes that have sparked revolutions and defined generations. From the original Clarks Desert Boot, first designed by Nathan Clark and launched in 1950, to the iconic Wallabee, each design has an instantly recognizable signature that makes it unmistakably Clarks.
  
**This season, we’re proud to introduce the Clarks Collective:** five incredible activists championing authentic social change. From mental health awareness and LGBTQ+ rights to greater racial equality, these trailblazers are committed to creating a brighter future for us all – bringing to life Clarks’ new global campaign, For the World Ahead. Through spotlighting their stories and supporting their chosen charities and initiatives, we’re ready to lead the way. After all, we’re originators, not imitators. It’s who we are, who we’ve always been. And to change the world of tomorrow, we’re doing things differently today.
  
Clarks International believes that the principle of equality of opportunity is fundamental to the company's operations. Our long held aim is to provide just and fair treatment for all employees. We will not discriminate on the grounds of sex, age, disability, marital status, colour, race, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation or gender reassignment.

**OVERVIEW:** For more than 50 years, Nassau Suffolk Law Services (NSLS) has been providing free, high­ quality legal counsel in civil matters when basic human needs are at stake including: eviction and foreclosure prevention, income maintenance, disability, elder law, healthcare, consumer fraud and more. As the only provider of comprehensive civil legal services on Long Island, our services support thousands of poor and low-income families and individuals who cannot afford an attorney. With the gap separating those who can and cannot afford legal representation widening each day, we work to ensure that everyone has equal access to justice, regardless of their ability to pay. NSLS has a staff of over one hundred employees situated in three offices across Long Island.

**DUTIES:** Seeking a staff attorney for a multi-faceted foreclosure defense project called Homeowner Protection Plan (HOPP), encompassing litigation, community education, and a clinic structure utilizing volunteers. The clinic will offer advice and counsel, as well as assisting those representing themselves to go through the basic steps, such as filing an answer, necessary to avoid default and assert any defenses that appear viable. Clinic development will involve working with local stakeholders, such as bar associations and law schools. The attorney will be working with our present Pro Bono Unit, and will be assigned a paralegal, which will allow the attorney to handle a limited caseload of their own, focusing on cases that are both challenging and have a realistic possibility of a positive outcome. The goal is to maintain housing for individual families while helping to stabilize challenged communities by preventing displacement of lower-income residents.

Nassau/Suffolk Law Services is a non-profit organization providing free legal services to low-income households. Applicants are expected to bring a commitment to ensuring and protecting the basic rights of a low-income population.

The Climate Act has created the most aggressive climate change goals in the nation and requires an ambitious agenda that blends proven catalysts with innovative approaches while operating across a broader energy arena that is rapidly evolving. New York State Energy Research & Development Authority (NYSERDA) is a driving force in realizing this agenda. NYSERDA works with stakeholders that span residents, business owners, developers, community leaders, local government officials, universities, utilities, investors, entrepreneurs, and more, to develop, invest, and foster conditions that:

* Attract the private sector capital investment needed to expand New York’s clean energy economy.
* Overcome barriers to using clean energy at a large-scale in New York.
* Enable New York’s communities and residents to benefit equitably from energy efficiency and renewable energy.

  

NYSERDA recognizes the role that public policy has played in perpetuating inequities faced by historically marginalized communities while working to leverage its critical role in addressing the climate crisis, energy injustice, and the legacy of environmental racism. To meet the State’s ambitious climate and equity goals, NYSERDA is transforming its approach to advance energy and climate justice through investments in our economy and workforce that address historic inequities and improve health and resilience for all New Yorkers*.* NYSERDA is working to address the challenges historically marginalized communities have faced in accessing programs and using their lived experience to inform solutions that support an inclusive clean energy transition.

  

The Energy and Climate Equity team drives NYSERDA’s Climate Equity Strategy, NYSERDA is shifting investments to reduce burden and increase benefits to frontline and historically marginalized communities while designing inclusive pathways for meaningful exchange to ensure these communities are front and center in the decisions that impact their everyday lives.

  

The Climate Act requires that Disadvantaged Communities receive a minimum of 35 percent, with a goal of 40 percent, of the benefits from investments in clean energy and energy efficiency programs.

Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) is a research and policy nonprofit that discovers and promotes effective solutions to global poverty problems. IPA brings together researchers and decision-makers to design, rigorously evaluate, and refine these solutions and their applications, ensuring that the evidence created is used to improve the lives of the world’s poor. In recent decades, trillions of dollars have been spent on programs designed to reduce global poverty, but clear evidence of which programs succeed is rare, and when evidence does exist, decision-makers often do not know about it. IPA exists to bring together leading researchers and these decision-makers to ensure that the evidence we create leads to a tangible impact on the world. Since its founding in 2002, IPA has worked with over 600 leading academics to conduct over 900 evaluations in 52 countries. This research has informed hundreds of successful programs that now impact millions of individuals worldwide. **Safeguarding at IPA**  

At Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), we are committed to creating a safe and respectful environment for all individuals, particularly children and vulnerable adults. As IPA adheres to strict safeguarding principles, selected candidates will be expected to adhere to these standards.

The Center was born of community activism in response to the AIDS epidemic, ensuring a place for LGBTQ people to access information, care, and support that they were not receiving elsewhere. We opened in 1983 to help people who had doors constantly closed in their faces, ostracized by family, friends, and shunned by the general society. Since that time, we have continually provided a wide array of services and programs to serve our community, with an intentional focus on providing support to those who are most vulnerable. We have always taken great care to be a space that responds to community need; engaging in diversity, equity and inclusion work is another outgrowth of those ongoing efforts. We recognize that in order to help LGBTQ individuals and our diverse community achieve parity in health, justice, opportunity and success outcomes, our organization must hold a strong foundation and competency in, as well as invest organizational focus on, equity and inclusion frameworks, practices and policies. This is also true in our hiring and retention of staff.
