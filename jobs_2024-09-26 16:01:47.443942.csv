Frick Art Research Library


Part-time, 7 hours/week; Compensation: $25.00 per hour

**Background**


Opened to the public in 1935, The Frick Collection is a world-renowned art museum consisting of more than 1,800 works of art from the ninth to the nineteenth centuries displayed in the intimate surroundings of the former home of Pittsburgh industrialist Henry Clay Frick. It is considered one of the world's most perfect museums and the residence is one of New York City’s few remaining Gilded Age mansions. The Frick welcomes nearly 300,000 visitors a year to its tranquil mansion on the Upper East Side, encouraging visitors to closely observe, reflect, and engage with its esteemed collection.


The Frick Art Research Library, founded by Mr. Frick’s daughter, Helen Clay Frick, in 1920, is an internationally recognized research library that serves as one of the world's most complete resources for the study of Western art. Our entire staff ensures that the resources of The Frick Collection are made accessible and inviting to “all persons whomsoever,” in accordance with the wishes of the museum’s founder.


Since summer 2020, The Frick has been in a temporary home, Frick Madison, at 75th Street and Madison Avenue (the former Whitney Museum of American Art), while renovations are underway at the mansion on 70th Street. Construction has progressed rapidly and, in addition to special exhibition galleries, education spaces we have added enhanced visitor amenities and accessible spaces. Frick Madison is now closed to the public. Staff is in the process of moving back to 1 East 70th Street and we hope to open to the public in early 2025.

Gap has always been about optimistic American style. Starting with our very first store on Ocean Avenue in San Francisco, opened almost 50 years ago by Doris and Don Fisher.

People who are rooted in the legacy that makes Gap what it is, but who are also focused on the future. People who want to leave the world better than they found it.


We’ve built our brand on staying true to our roots while always being out in front of what’s next. If you want to be part of an iconic American brand, and help lead the way for where we’re headed, we’d love to have you join us.
