Cold Spring Harbor Asia DNA Learning Center (CSH Asia DNALC) seeks a talented biologist with a passion for educational outreach for a unique leadership position in Suzhou, China. CSH Asia DNALC is the first hands-on teaching institution of its kind in China, with the objective of providing the same cutting-edge methods in biology education as offered at the flagship DNALC in Cold Spring Harbor, New York. Located just 40 minutes from the vibrant international city of Shanghai, Suzhou is the “Venice of China” and a traditional center of silk production.

CSH Asia DNALC was established in 2015 through a collaboration with Suzhou Industrial Park, a premier science city developed as a joint venture with the Republic of Singapore. Now, with a base of well-established lab programs and dedicated teaching staff, CSH Asia DNALC is looking for an individual who will directly liaise with the Cold Spring Harbor DNALC to ensure that all programs continue to adhere to its high standards of instruction. The Director of Science will have oversight of lab operations and will introduce new lab experiences developed by the Cold Spring Harbor DNALC – including DNA barcoding, *Taq* polymerase production, nanopore DNA sequencing, and phage biomanufacturing. Teaching – both student labs and teacher professional development – is an important element of the position.

The successful candidate will become a member of an elite, influential group recognized worldwide as a leader in modern bioscience education. The position demands a motivated individual with demonstrated leadership and communication skills, plus a sincere interest in fostering international relations.

**Position Requirements**

A Ph.D. in molecular genetics, genomics, bioinformatics or related discipline is required; postdoctoral work and/or teaching experience is preferred. The ideal candidate will have attended secondary school and college in the US and appreciate the benefits of American science education. Instruction will be in English, so Chinese language ability is not required. Intensive initial training will take place at Cold Spring Harbor DNALC in New York, followed by transfer to Suzhou. Periodic travel to the US and within China will be expected. Salary RMB 450,000 per year. Premium faculty housing, paid vacation, and medical insurance provided.

**Supplemental Information**

**How to Apply**:  
Applicants should send their cover letter, CV and list of 3 personal references to dnalccareers@cshl.edu.

Nursing Workforce Transformation Program

  

The Parker Jewish Institute for Healthcare and Rehabilitation, located in New Hyde Park, NY, is seeking a Full Time Clinical Mentor to join our team of dedicated staff working in the Nursing Workforce Transformation Program.

  

Parker's Superior Health Care Community of Practice (SHCCP) is an innovative clinical program that will train diverse Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs), Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs), and Registered Nurses (RNs) to meet Parker's mission which is "" to provide with compassion and dedication, superior quality health care and rehabilitation for adults."" With this overarching idea, the project will be framed by a ""community of practice"" model, in which cohort members interact regularly to learn professional practices, become socialized into the culture of person-centered care, and come to see themselves as valuable, empowered community members who belong in healthcare. Supported by culturally and linguistically diverse staff/mentors, individual trainees become connected to the larger social order of the healthcare community. Access to professional/social networks give them knowledge, values, beliefs, and attitudes that are conducive to their professional empowerment and success; they contribute their own sociocultural and linguistic richness

  

The result will be improved quality of care, professional and economic growth for the employees, a stronger long term care workforce capable of meeting current and future demands, and increased capacity to train a diverse workforce.

  

For this program, we are seeking a full time Mentor to work collaboratively with the other members of the Workforce Transformation Program and collaboratively with the staff.

Cross County Savings Bank is a local, FDIC-insured mutual savings bank that was originally founded in 1888.
