We are looking for a Spanish teacher (Spanish first language) with experience working with children in preschools. This is a MUST, preferably with music or dance background, to start in September. We do also yoga and zumba classes in Spanish.

The program is given with the topics to work every week. Our sessions are fun and full of energy! The routine consists on a circle time based in songs and movement and games. Teachers must have experience handling large groups of kids and teaching them Spanish, making them repeat words and small sentences and having interactive sessions.

We are an Enrichment program, that means we go to the preschools we teach the different grades and we leave. We do a minimum of one hour and a half in every center mostly 2 hours in the morning between 9:30 and 12. The ages of the children are between 2 and 5 years old.

All our schools are in Brooklyn mainly, indeed forced me to put an address but in reality we work with preschools all around Brooklyn. We need a person living in Brooklyn, as they will have an easier commute around. The Neighborhoods we are in are mostly Park Slope, Carrol Gardens, Williamsburg, Bayridge, Brooklyn Heights and we are expanding.

This is a part time position. We are opening a new position and have a schedule from Monday to Friday ready.

As we are working with children we need a professional person, reliable, consistent, that respects children's schedule and that will follow through until June, that always arrives 5 min before time and that loves working with children. We provide training and materials.

The payment is weekly, each Saturday morning you get paid for the week, through Zelle. The candidates will need to have a working permit, be willing to have a background check (if you don't have it already) and be fully vaccinated.

Send us your resume and we will be in contact shortly,
