**About B’ShERT**

B’ShERT is a Reform Jewish synagogue in Brooklyn with a history over 100 years long. Located in the heart of Flatbush in Ditmas Park, B’ShERT is committed to providing an inclusive and welcoming spiritual home regardless of where families may be on their Jewish journeys. B’ShERT officially formed in July 2018, when the communities of Temple Beth Emeth v’Ohr Progressive Shaari Zedek and Progressive Temple Beth Ahavath Sholom consolidated into a new entity. B’ShERT enthusiastically welcomes members of all Jewish traditions, families of multiple faith backgrounds, LBGTQ+ members, differently abled members, and those who simply wish to learn and experience our warm and friendly community.

**About the Religious School**

B’ShERT’s religious school philosophy focuses on instilling a love of Judaism in our students and creating belonging for all Jewish students in our classrooms.

B’ShERT’s religious school meets once a week on Saturday mornings from 9:45am-12:30pm. From 9:45am-11am, students attend religious school in the classroom. Then, from 11am-12:30pm, students join their families for Shabbat morning services, including a full Torah service. We know we don’t have a ton of time in the classroom, but if students develop a strong connection to Judaism, we believe they will engage in lifelong learning.

During the weekdays, students learn Hebrew in *chevruta* (paired learning/study) on Zoom with a Hebrew teacher. Saturday morning part-time teachers are not responsible for Zoom teaching during the weekdays.

**About the position**

B’ShERT is seeking an enthusiastic teacher with a love for Judaism and working with children. Teachers will be provided curriculum and lesson plans 2 weeks in advance of teaching. All materials will be provided by the Education Director, who will also provide on site support during the religious school day. Teachers are expected to:

* Arrive promptly at 9:30am and stay for the duration of the Torah service until 1pm
* Prepare to teach religious school curriculum (this year’s focus is Jewish diasporic ritual and history) by reviewing the lesson plan prior to class
* Make the curriculum your own! Bring your creativity and passion to the classroom and expand upon the curriculum provided (we love music, games, movement, art, etc!)
* Create an inclusive, warm, welcoming, and joyful environment for your class. All students belong at B’ShERT!
* Model participation in services and help students engage in services - sit near students, point out parts that connect to the lesson in class, encourage them to ask questions
* Occasional setup and breakdown help (during working hours on Saturdays) for special events such as Model Seder, Purim Carnival, etc
* Attend 1 field trip with your class (and parent chaperones) on a Sunday afternoon during the school year (date TBA)
* Attend monthly check-in meetings on Zoom with teaching staff and Education Director (compensated and meeting time determined based on teachers availability during weeknights)

**Accessibility** 

We are working on making our space accessible for all. B’ShERT is partially accessible: there is a ramp to enter into the building. The entire first floor, including a classroom, the sanctuary, an ADA compliant gender neutral bathroom, and the community room, is wheelchair accessible. Our building is not fully physically accessible for wheelchair users or those who cannot navigate stairs, however, as there are classrooms upstairs and a function room downstairs. Teachers can teach a class on the first floor and attend the service in the sanctuary without using stairs.

**Qualifications**

* Love of Judaism, Jewish learning, and exploring Jewish concepts with students in the classroom
* Enthusiasm for working on a small team - we are excited to be a close knit community and hope you enjoy that, too!
* Belief in belonging for all - everyone belongs at B’ShERT
* Familiarity with and comfort with Reform Jewish values, practices, and observance\\*
* 2 years of experience working with children (camp, in-classroom teaching, after-school programming)
* Must be available to work Saturdays in-person - no remote options available for this position

\\*A note about observance: As Reform Jews at B’ShERT, we are comfortable writing, drawing, and using technology on Shabbat. *Shomer Shabbos* teachers will be accommodated and *madrichim* (teen helpers) will provide support in the classroom. Our services are hybrid and involve a projector with a Zoom meeting in which folks can join the service online. Please note that the services always include Zoom/computer technology, amplified sound, and live streaming.

**Compensation: $50-$55 per hour depending on experience**

Teachers will be compensated for 3.5 hours of work each Saturday (9:30am-1pm)

Please submit a resume and cover letter to our Education Director, Jessie, at . Also, if you have any questions or clarifications, don’t hesitate to reach out!

NYU Law’s Center on Race, Inequality & the Law (CRIL) and Guarini Center on Environmental, Energy & Land Use Law (Guarini Center) seek to hire a full-time Director to develop and lead the Environmental Justice Lab (EJL) that they are jointly launching.



The Vision for the EJL


The EJL will play a critical role building a vibrant environmental justice program at NYU Law School and will:


* work with partners, including impacted communities, to address longstanding environmental racism, amplify the voices of disadvantaged communities, and build a just, decarbonized future;
* provide law students with a unique opportunity to engage in cutting-edge policy advocacy, litigation, and research in the field of environmental justice;

The Director’s Main Responsibilities



The Director will establish and lead the EJL, which is a joint initiative of CRIL and the Guarini Center. In doing so, the Director will work with Vincent Southerland, faculty director of CRIL, and Katrina Wyman, faculty director of the Guarini Center, along with the executive directors (Jason Williamson–CRIL and Christine Billy–Guarini Center) and staff of these two centers at NYU Law.



Key responsibilities of the Director will include:
