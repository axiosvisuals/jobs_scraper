### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/U--haul","http://www.uhaul.com/","2727 North Central Avenue

You have at least 5 years of food service / restaurant experience (with all that entails) in NYC (you live in NYC) and seek a new challenge and opportunity. Notwithstanding your years of experience, you are still fresh, open to new concepts, not jaded or cynical. Perhaps you want one more go around in something totally different, exciting with great personal, professional, and financial potential. In any case, salary is not the driver in your decision. This role is posted as FT due to AngelList limitations, but could also be PT or Contract.

As a start-up, you must have a strong, intense work ethic. One of our financial objectives is to create a liquidity event, probably an IPO, between year 5-7 so this is a MISSION, not a job.

We are a simple Italian health and social sustainability food service start-up that will roll-out beginning in NYC. We will then perfect the model and will open approx. 39 shops in NYC within 3 years. NYC will serve as the springboard for national expansion (669 shops within 10 years), and beyond.

First Entrant, Simple, Scalable, Timely, Socially Sustainable Solution to a Big and Growing National and Increasingly International HEALTH & INEQUALITY Problem

PROBLEM:

Current and growing health problems associated with poor eating habits (contributing to obesity, diabetes, etc.) afflict everyone in one way or another where fast-food prevails and fast-food prevails virtually everywhere AND income inequality particularly in the food service sector make it virtually impossible for hard working people to work their way out of poverty.

SOLUTION:

Lilly’s authentic, truly unique, and as first entrant, disruptive solution to the health crisis arising from poor eating habits is a keenly focused product offering consisting of a few simple high quality, healthier, appealing and tasty old world charm ITALIAN “snack” foods as found in a typical small (approx. 1,500 sf) Italian bread bakery shop (panificio) on a mostly retail take-out basis (NOT full-service restaurant), and service that connects with customers. Simple and inviting yet elegant Italian store design / panache, and emphasis on social sustainability will position Lilly’s as a compelling healthier “SLOW FOOD” cultural alternative to “fast food” inspiring customers with better eating habits that contribute to better health facilitating a more fulfilling life. Tasty, healthier offerings satisfy the palate contributing to portion control. We will do our part to combat poverty and income inequality by paying employees a living wage (social sustainability).

OPPORTUNITY:

Leverage our simplicity and uniqueness so as to scale and create a brand quickly. We will roll-out in NYC, then perfect the model and open approx. 39 shops in NYC within 3 years. NYC will serve as the springboard for national expansion (669 shops within 10 years), and eventually internationally. Everyone, even kids today are more health conscious so all demos are potential customers. In the U.S alone, the retail packaged snack market was $124 billion in 2014 (Nielsen Global Survey of Snack Foods, Nielsen Holdings, www.nielsen.com).

In your COVER note, please follow the following format EXACTLY: a) describe yourself, b) your possible interest, c) skills, d) expectations, e) if you need to leave your current position, by what date and if you do not need to leave your current position, by what date would you like to make a change, f) would you dedicate the necessary time for due diligence, i.e., read lots of stuff, get to know us and we get to know you, g) contact info., etc., h) describe why we are a good fit, and i) send your FULLY UPDATED ACCURATE RESUME.

**Posting Summary**
Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, is seeking a Laboratory Technician for the department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.  

  

A Laboratory Technician position is available in the Serebrenik Laboratory in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Rutgers University – Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in the areas of neurodegeneration, genomics, proteostasis, chemical biology, and high throughput microscopy.

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/U--haul","http://www.uhaul.com/","2727 North Central Avenue
