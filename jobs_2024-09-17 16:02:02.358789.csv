**Great Many’s mission is to make hair growth an answer, not a question.** We are a system and a studio for preserving and restoring hair, for women and men.

We are setting out to be the first brand to offer a holistic combination of (1) clinically-backed non-surgical services in a beautiful, modern, and hospitality-focused studio, (2) our own line of everyday scalp/hair care products that help current and future hair thrive and (3) access to proven prescriptions — all under one brand.

**Why Great Many?** Tackling preserving or restoring hair requires multiple pathways and patience – and today's landscape is single-solution oriented, mixed with snake oil and infomercial promises, and is incredibly fragmented (and frustrating) for the customer. We want to change that.

**An In-Studio & Online Experience.** In our first Studio, opening in Noho in May 2024, clients will be able to experience a hair consultation and access services *and* products. Online, customers will be able to access education, proven prescriptions via telehealth, and buy our launch set of scalp/hair care products.

**Where Is Great Many Going?** Today, we’re just getting off the ground. In several years, we envision a fleet of studios dotting the US, thousands of telemedicine customers outside of our studio geography, and our expanding line of clean hair/scalp care products on shelves of incredible retail partners. Join us, and be part of the change the hair health and hair growth space needs.

**Who You Are**

As a **Registered Nurse (RN)** at Great Many, you are responsible for day-to-day care of clients. Specifically, we are focused on treating hair preservation and restoration – for women and men – through comprehensive, guided consultations, treatment plans, the administration of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) (for now; services to expand), prescriptions, and at-home scalp/hair care routine recommendations.

Ideal candidates have hair growth/dermatologist experience, a commitment to clinical excellence, and a hospitality-orientation to help clients feel a sense of direction, hope, progress, and success in a very confusing space. The ideal candidate is also excited about the prospect of getting in at the ground level of a brand with plans to grow and fulfill its mission of making hair growth an answer, not a question, nationwide.

**The Roles & Responsibilities**

* **Patient Assessment, Education and Consultation:** Provide personalized Great Many consultations to assess clients’ hair loss or thinning, educate, discuss treatment options, expectations, and potential outcomes.
* **Treatment Planning:** Using the Great Many tool, provide individualized treatment plans based on patient needs and preferences. Ensure patients have a clear understanding of pros and cons and expectations.
* **Treatment Administration:** Administer and oversee hair restoration treatments, including PRP therapy. (Prescription management will be done in concert with other staff members)
* **Quality Assurance:** Maintain high standards of patient care and safety within the clinic. Ensure compliance with all relevant regulations and protocols.
* **Documentation:** Maintain accurate and detailed patient records. Keep thorough records of treatments, progress, and outcomes.
* **Continuous Improvement.** Contribute to the development of new clinic procedures and protocols to optimize efficiency and client experience.

**How You Work**

* **You are hospitality-oriented** and understand how people feel matters as much as the ‘what’ of what we do, both with our team and our clients
* **You are a clear communicator**
* **You have a positive attitude** in the face of change, newness, and problem solving that comes with a new business
* **You are a creative problem solver** when it comes to figuring out new and improved ways for us to operate and find our stride
* **You are a constant learner with a growth-mindset**, always seeking continuing education, new learnings, and professional development

**Your Experience**

* Active Registered Nurse (RN) license in New York State with at least 5 years of experience
* Phlebotomy experience required
* Active Basic Life Safety (BLS) Certification
* On-site part-time position; with a operational schedule to be developed with business needs and will likely include a weekend day or a rotating schedule

**Your Perks**

* Competitive Salary
* Medical Malpractice Coverage
* Great Many Products & Services Discounts

**The role will be based in our first Studio in Noho, New York City.**
