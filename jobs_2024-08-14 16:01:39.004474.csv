**About us**: The Port Chester Carver Center creates opportunity for Port Chester residents to learn, work, and thrive through programs that nourish, educate, and empower. Founded in 1943, Carver Center began as a small storefront daycare program for African American children whose parents worked in wartime defense plants. The Carver Center grew to be a small food pantry and childcare program that operated out of a rented synagogue basement for over 50 years.

The Village of Port Chester’s demographics reflect that of large urban cities. The ethnic makeup of Port Chester is 59.4% Hispanic/Latino, 31.6% White, 6.5% African American, 2.1% Asian and 2.1% other. Our community is home to the highest percentage of Latinos (59.4%) and the lowest per capita income of the 44 communities in Westchester County. 67% of children in Port Chester are eligible for free lunch, the fourth highest rate in Westchester County.

In 2000, Carver Center moved to our current location—a 50,000 square foot building that features classrooms, multi-use rooms, a 25-yard heated indoor pool, saunas, a full-court gymnasium, movement studio, a fully equipped kitchen, tech lab, food market, and a STEAM makerspace. Informally known as the heart of the community, Carver Center’s programs and services are crafted to meet the holistic needs of people at every stage of life.

Carver Center’s programs address food insecurity; childcare; out-of-school-time enrichment; youth development; services for immigrants (citizenship and ESL classes); programs for senior citizens; aquatics and more.

hese orders need special attention, care, and fulfillment capabilities. You will be expected to partially use and understand photoshop at a basic level. Also you will be expected to learn and use some of our backend order management programs (very easy).

My name is Lupe and i've been taking care of warehouse (shipping out orders, preparing inventory, etc) since the company started in 2020. We've grown exponentially, and it's been a fun journey but we have lofty goals ahead of us :).

The way things are looking this year, it seems very promising. It will be too much for me to handle, and i'll need help with preparing everything and managing other employees especially as the Fall comes around.

Just a note: there's no in-store aspect to this position. We sell exclusively to online customers and we have our warehouse unit on the basement floor of an office building.

Duration: ASAP - January.  
Hours: 30-40 per week, especially after September. Can work more, but both weekdays and some weekends are necessary.

We have a very small team, and your help will be immeasurably valuable!

**What to expect:** It’s our first year with an official segregated personalized and wholesale order department. Together we’ll learn how to make things better and more efficient and really grow this segment of the business. Expect the following:

* Picking and packing items and preparing them for shipment
* Use of programs such as **Photoshop**, Shopify, and other individual platforms that we sell through.
* Customer communication may be required at certain times
* Learning how to print on ceramic ornaments (we use sublimation printer and then press them).
* Being able to press ornaments is necessary, but you don’t need a lot of strength at all. Just healthy hands.
* Joining our Slack online group chat (most of our workers, graphic designers and such, are digital).
* Communication with our online customer service team and graphic design team that helps us fulfill customer orders
* Your work will be valued immensely. Every person is an integral part of the team. To make sure you read all of the above, please write “Christmas Rules!” on your application.

**Benefits:**  
- Great for resume and career, unless you stick with us! It will look good that you played an important role in what will be considered by the end of this year one of America's fastest growing companies.  
- Free food. Me and Mike (company owner) will try to keep us stocked up on snacks, coffee, and water, and lots of goodies :).  
- New skills and exposure to a fast growing startup. Great life skills that help with leadership, multitasking, and dealing with challenging high pressure tasks and situations!

The National Center for the Study of Collective Bargaining in Higher Education and the Professions (the Center) is a national labor-management research center housed in and supported by Hunter College, City University of New York.

Since 1972, the Center has been dedicated to studying the use of collective bargaining as a form of workplace democracy.

It believes collective bargaining is an important means for advancing higher education and the working conditions at colleges and universities as well as other industries. We believe the study of collective bargaining is essential for a knowledge-based dialogue concerning labor-management and educational issues, and is critically important for reasoned societal debate that will lead to social progress.

The Center is comprised of labor and management professionals, practitioners, and scholars interested in studying contemporary and historical labor-management issues, best practices in collective bargaining, legal and legislative developments, and public support for higher education. It provides a clearinghouse and forum for scholarly research and ideas concerning labor relations, collective bargaining, labor history, and labor law issues.

As part of its mission, the Center hosts annual and regional conferences and publishes a peer review journal and a monthly newsletter that offer unique insights into current and historical issues and trends in collective bargaining. University administrators and union leaders collaborate in National Center's activities.

**Ahoy, Matey!**

Success On The Spectrum is a national Autism Treatment franchise with a dedication to quality. We offer ABA, ST, OT, and Social Skills Classes in our nautical centers, in-home, and in-school. Our play-based model emphasizes on NET, so we take clients on field trips once per month! We also encourage high parent involvement and allow parents to watch their child’s therapy live from our viewing room!

At SOS, we value work/life balance. Each BCBA is assisted by an intern and has a max caseload of 12 full-time clients. BCBA Clinical Directors have low caseloads (about 9 full-time clients) and generally work Monday-Friday 8:00am-4:00pm and rarely take work home. As Company grows, you gradually transition from BCBA to Clinical Director.

Clinical Directors serve as the company Quality Assurance Officer and Ethics Officer. You must have good communication skills and problem solving skills, as you will supervise the quality of other BCBAs’ work. Quarterly, you will analyze the progress of clients company-wide and lead in-service trainings based on your staffs’ weaknesses.

SOS is proud to have full billing transparency. Office Managers are responsible for making the daily client schedules. Nothing gets billed to insurance without BCBA approval.

Success On The Spectrum is growing quickly, and we can accelerate your career faster than any other company you will ever work for. There are opportunities for you to move up to Regional Director as your employer opens new locations. Being part of a franchise also gives you the option of transferring to a different location, in the event that you need to move away. If you ever want to retire from clinical work, you will have the unique opportunity to open your own franchise!

SOS does not require employees to sign non-compete agreements. All BCBAs get two weeks of initial training from our corporate office - for this, you may have to travel to Houston for 1 week. We do not require training payback agreements.
