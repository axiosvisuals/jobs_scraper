You’ve put in the long hours and have done the work. You have a solid 4+ years of experience with a wide variety of nonimmigrant and immigrant visas, not to mention managing the full PERM lifecycle. At this point in your career, you’re taking ownership of and driving large corporate accounts, and doing amazing work every day that you’re proud of—*but* you’re not satisfied. Maybe you feel stuck or uninspired. You want more autonomy and fulfillment and you’re ready for that “next step” in your career.

A small but mighty boutique immigration firm in Brooklyn that takes immense pride in their work product and also cares about the well-being of their attorneys and staff is looking for a full-time **Associate Attorney**.

The firm is searching for an **Associate Attorney** in a hybrid role who can start ASAP and hit the ground running with a diverse caseload. This is NYC. You know what that means: a fast-paced work environment with competing deadlines and demanding clients. The candidate needs to be personable, able to put clients at ease, and convey confidence with stellar communication skills. And if they have or love dogs, they’re in luck—it’s a dog-friendly office. (Nothing like petting a dog to relieve the stress of a frustrating RFE.)

These are absolute musts:

● Minimum 4+ years of business immigration experience at a large corporate immigration law firm (or combined attorney experience at both small and large firms).

● Experience with employment-based nonimmigrant visas including H, L, E, O, TN, and J-1 visas—with the exception of E-1/E-2s, the candidate ***must*** know these visa types inside and out and be ready to jump in right away to manage these cases.

● Experience with the entire PERM lifecycle including case strategy, recruitment, preparation of PERM paperwork, and responding to PERM audits.

● Experience with employment-based immigrant visas (EB-1, EB-2, EB-2 NIW, and EB-3) as well as immigrant visa consular processing and adjustment of status.

● Experience as the main point of contact for high volume, corporate accounts and managing the day-to-day account service—this is *crucial*.

● Excellent verbal and written communication skills, attention to detail, organizational and multi-tasking skills, superior deadline management, and ability to achieve a high level of productivity with accuracy and consistency, along with reasonable work schedule flexibility.

● Juris Doctor degree and U.S. Bar admission.

● *Preference*: experience working with Google Docs, Google Drive, and Adobe.

Here is what the firm is ***NOT*** looking for. A candidate who:

● Has only worked on “aspects” or “parts” of the above-listed NIV and IV types and PERM.

● Needs to be prompted to take action for case and client management.

● Asks questions *before* trying to figure things out on their own.

● Thinks going to a boutique firm is a “downgrade” and is looking to coast.

● Is a ChatGPT lawyer that does not take the time to dig deep and research when necessary.

**More About the Position** 

The goal for this position is to relieve Partners from day-to-day responsibilities and case/client management for several corporate accounts as well as select individual clients. The candidate should be ambitious with a strong desire to learn, grow, and succeed. While the firm cares deeply about “quality of life,” the role is nevertheless challenging and requires hard work, a positive attitude, and good judgment.

What you’ll do:

● Provide U.S. immigration-related legal services to clients, including advising on legal requirements for U.S. visas and green cards as well as on legal compliance with U.S. immigration laws.

● Oversee preparation of visa filings including various immigrant and nonimmigrant applications and petitions, responses to Requests for Evidence, motions to reopen/reconsider, appeal briefs, and waivers of inadmissibility.

● Conduct legal research on complex immigration issues and advise clients on the same.

● Remain up-to-date on regulatory, statutory, and policy changes applicable to U.S. immigration laws in order to provide clients accurate and timely guidance.

● Autonomously handle day-to-day email and telephone correspondence with clients, including client consultations and intake/viability checks.

● Manage several corporate accounts of varying sizes as well as individual cases, including providing legal advice and guidance to clients, preparing foreign national employees for visa interviews, ensuring timely case preparation and case initiations, working autonomously to provide ongoing legal support to these accounts, and escalating issues to Partners as necessary.

**Salary Range and Benefits** 

The firm offers a competitive salary, comprehensive benefits, and an innovative self-managed PTO program in a casual work environment. Salary range and benefits are:

● $145,000 - $165,00 depending upon qualifications and experience

● Health, vision, dental, and life insurance

● 401(k) with employer matching

● Hybrid remote work environment

● Up to 12 paid holidays and 2 flex days

● Summer Fridays

● Firm MacBook

**About the Firm** 

Founded by immigration attorneys from BigLaw, the firm prides itself on turning the traditional law firm model on its head. The firm’s open and inclusive culture is built around the concept of “accountable flexibility” where employees are provided freedom and flexibility in return for staying accountable for the work they produce. The firm rewards high performers with more flexibility and opportunities for growth, raises, promotions, and additional discretionary compensation where firm profits permit. The Partners aim to avoid micromanagement and instead provide their team with the resources, training, and guidance needed to do their best work in a sustainable way.

**How to Apply**

Interested candidates should submit a cover letter, Resume/CV, and writing sample. Please address cover letter to Regina Stucklen.
