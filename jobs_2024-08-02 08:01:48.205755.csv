Prudential: 2025 Risk Management Internship Program
Location(s):
Newark, NJ (Hybrid)
Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE: PRU), a global financial services leader and premier active global investment manager with approximately $1.5 trillion in assets under management as of March 31, 2024, has operations in the United States, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. Prudential’s diverse and talented employees help make lives better and create financial opportunity for more people by expanding access to investing, insurance, and retirement security. Prudential’s iconic Rock symbol has stood for strength, stability, expertise, and innovation for nearly 150 years. For more information, please visit news.prudential.com.
Are you an on-campus leader who wants to apply your curious mind to problem-solving, trend research, and data analysis to make an impact within a dynamic, evolving organization? Or maybe you’re looking to gain foundational knowledge and skills to apply in a professional environment, while developing strong relationships through training, mentorship, and ongoing feedback. At Prudential that’s a challenge we can help you meet as a member of our Risk Management Internship.
Think for a second how the following recent headlines could affect Prudential’s businesses:* “New Weapons Against Cancer: Millions of Bacteria Programmed to Kill”
* “Interest Rates Just Keep Falling. Economic Orthodoxy Is Falling With Them”
* “COVID-19 Worldwide: The Pandemic’s Impact On The Economy And Markets”


Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) helps ensure that Prudential has a comprehensive framework for understanding the risks embedded in and across its businesses, so that the company can manage these risks effectively, evaluate current and future risk challenges and opportunities, and enhance shareholder value. Risk Management is at the heart of how Prudential thrives during the constant evolution of the financial and insurance industries, in advances in technology and biometrics, and through changes in global economies and governmental laws. In our summer internship program, you will gain exposure to a core function of Risk Management while receiving technical and professional skills training and partnering with leaders to help inform business strategy.
Timeline:
The internship program will run from Monday, June 2nd, 2025, to Friday, August 8th, 2025.
We review applications on a rolling basis, and we encourage you to apply as soon as you are ready. All fall applications will close on or by Friday, October 4th, 2024, at midnight ET. We reserve the right to close applications early due to volume or role(s) being filled.*Applications for PGIM Investment Professional roles are open as of July 1st. All other businesses will open on August 2nd.* To ensure you are considered for the opportunities you want most, you are only able to apply to 3 positions per recruitment season.
Your Day to Day:
Placements will vary across the business, some experiences within our Risk Management Internship Program could include:* Insurance Risk Management: Insurance Risk Management is concerned with Prudential’s long-term liabilities we have through our insurance and retirement products. For example, an intern on our Biometrics Landscape team within Insurance Risk would research scientific papers on advances in disease cures, and present findings for leadership so that our Insurance businesses can understand how life-expectancy for our customer base may change.
* Financial Markets Risk Management: The pillars of this function are risk quantification, risk constraints (limits), credit analysis, and strategic review of sectors and trends. An RMDP might be involved by looking at data from Rating Agencies on corporate credit worthiness and use that analysis to review and critique our ongoing investment inputs (where we’re investing our assets!). Or you may be evaluating the potential impact on the Company of a range of coherent, multi-year stress scenarios, chosen to examine the Company’s significant risk exposures, and consistent in severity with a rational interpretation of “worst-in-history” experience. This team also monitors changes to market prices that affect our portfolios and may cause asset-liability mismatching (they make sure we have enough money to pay claims when we need to!). An RMDP analyst would produce and present daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly reports on our derivative trading positions, to inform leadership on new market sensitivities.
* Operational Risk Management: Each one of Prudential’s businesses and corporate functions has specific operational practices (people, processes, systems, and events) that affect how they achieve their goals. Operational Risk specialists develop assessments, analyze events, and manage issues to ensure these practices don’t fail us in execution. For example, an intern might discuss the overall risk profile of the Annuities Business with leaders in order to understand and enhance systems used by the business that ultimately benefit the end customer experience.


Our Risk Internship is just one part of the larger enterprise-wide program that is made up of over 300 interns across the country. You will be joining a collaborative and inclusive corporate climate and will be matched with a mentor from our full-time rotational program, the Risk Management Development Program (RMDP). Rising seniors are eligible for offers to join the RMDP as a full-time employee. Rising juniors are eligible for offers to return for a second summer internship in a different Risk function.
