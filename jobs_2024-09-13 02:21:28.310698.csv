BALDOR HISTORY:  

When Louis Balducci rented a pushcart for $5.00 a week in 1918, little did he know that he was laying the foundations for Baldor Specialty Foods. In 1946, Louis opened a fruit stand called Balducci’s Produce in Greenwich Village that flourished into a beloved specialty food shop. Food writer James Beard was a regular customer and noted that Balducci’s always sold “the best of the best, at the right price. ""A family business from the start, the company employed numerous family members including son-in-law, Kevin Murphy. Murphy ran Balducci’s wholesale division, Baldor, so passionately that the  

Balducci family encouraged him to establish the business as an independent entity in 1991. Over the next decade, Baldor sustained continuous growth while maintaining the standard of excellence that made Balducci’s a success. The company cemented its reputation for sourcing expertise after introducing blanched frisee to the American market. Murphy named it “Circus Frisee” after famed restaurant Le Cirque. Today, Baldor is the leading importer and distributor of fresh produce and specialty foods in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. The company is headed by Kevin’s son, T.J. Murphy, C.E.O.  

Under his leadership, Baldor remains committed to customer service, quality and innovation. Baldor Specialty Foods has a long legacy of quality, consistency, and service. Under the leadership of the former Owner and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Murphy, President Mike Muzyk joined Baldor in 1996 and today works closely with Kevin’s son, TJ Murphy, who has been the Owner and Chief Executive Office since 2013. Under the leadership and partnership of TJ and Mike, in the last seven years, Baldor has achieved consistent double-digit growth in addition to geographic, category, product and channel expansion.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Baldor-Specialty-Foods","http://www.baldorfood.com/","155 Food Center Drive Bronx, NY 10474","1,001 to 5,000","$100M to $500M (USD)","","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/e3b9819e55268c9e7c73e5714df9a2f2","","",""

**Life at Abridge**
-------------------


At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.


Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

**Life at Abridge**
-------------------


At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.


Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

**Diversity & Inclusion**

**Life at Abridge**
-------------------


At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.


Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

**Diversity & Inclusion**
-------------------------


Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

**Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud**
----------------------------------------------------------


We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process.

**Life at Abridge**
-------------------


At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.


Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.
