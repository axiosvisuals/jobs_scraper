The program will select early-career scholars from around the world to be in residence at Princeton for an academic year (10 months) and to engage in research and discussion around a common theme. The fellowships will be awarded to those employed outside the United States who have a faculty appointment, a professional research appointment, or are established independent scholars. They will also be expected to return to their positions at the conclusion of the fellowship. Lastly, they must have demonstrated outstanding scholarly achievement and unusual intellectual promise. Early-career scholars will be appointed at the rank of Visiting Research Scholar.
The program for the academic year 2025-26 will focus on ""Postimperial Spaces of Amnesia."" While the current fellows are in conversation investigating the residues of colonialism in diverse parts of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, this next group will expand the conversation to examine the willed amnesia, or yet nostalgia, concerning the imperial past-in former metropoles and colonies alike, where memories of often violent processes of expropriation have frequently been distanced in time and space, erased, or are simply not recalled today. This is despite the continuum of supply and demand straddling the postcolonial moment. One might think, for example, of the global demand for products with plantation antecedents such as coffee and rubber; ongoing issues of migration, mobility and citizenship; or decisions about museums, monuments, and the content of school curricula. Just where and when does the question of the colonial past figure in the modern public sphere as governments make decisions about how to remember (or forget) while movements seek social justice or reparations? What is forgotten when something else is recalled and celebrated? Who decides when the colonial came to an end?
Applicants may address any region of the world that has had a colonial relationship, and may be from any disciplinary background in the humanities and social sciences. Applicants must apply online at https://www.princeton.edu/acad-positions/position/36541. Applications are due on November 15, 2024 (11:59 p.m. EST). To be eligible, applicants must have received their Ph.D. (or equivalent) no earlier than September 1, 2015. Fellowships will be awarded on the strength of a candidate's proposed research project, the relationship of the project to the program's theme, the candidate's scholarly record and ability to contribute to the intellectual life of the program. More information: https://funggfp.princeton.edu/applications.
The following items must be submitted by the applicant, in English, by November 15, 2024:
- Cover letter (1.5 pages maximum)
- Curriculum Vitae (including publications)
- Research proposal (maximum of 3 pages, single spaced)
- One writing sample (article or book chapter, maximum of 50 pages)
- If an applicant is an established independent scholar, please upload a PDF stating this as the applicant's current status.
- The names and email addresses for three referees, who will be contacted automatically by the online application system with an invitation to upload their letter of recommendation to the system by the application deadline. (\\*Please note: all letters of reference should be submitted by your referees before the November 15, 2024 deadline.\\*)
Should an offer be made, successful candidates who hold faculty appointments or professional research appointments, will be required to submit an official letter from their current employer affirming that they would be permitted to accept the offer and to spend the academic year at Princeton University.

Summer 2025 Bartley Fellowship - Opinion Internship


Job Description:


The Wall Street Journal's Opinion section is seeking beginning journalists - juniors, seniors or recent graduates (within one year of graduation) with reporting and writing backgrounds at their school newspapers or elsewhere - for 10-week paid summer internships in our New York City office. The in-person internships are an opportunity to get hands-on experience working alongside some of the best opinion writers and editors in the world.


Our internships - formally, the Bartley Fellowships - are in honor and memory of our section's former Editor, Robert L. (Bob) Bartley. Opportunities will be awarded to young thinkers and writers who intend to pursue a career in journalism, whose views are broadly consistent with Bob's, and the Opinion section’s, philosophy. It is essential that applicants be familiar with, and interested in, the ideas for which the Journal editorial page stands.


Several fellows will be selected each year through an application process that will be judged by senior editors. Bartley Fellows will be assigned to a department within the Opinion section - Features (Op-Eds and Columns); Arts in Review; Book Reviews; or Social Media. They will assist in researching, writing and editing content for the print and digital editions of the Journal, and will contribute as needed to social media and digital production tasks. While they're assigned to a department for the summer, all interns are encouraged to submit their ideas for articles or projects to editors in any part of the Opinion section.


Internships are paid, and generally take place over June, July and August, though start dates can be flexible in certain circumstances.


If you are interested in applying for the Opinion, Books, Arts, and Social Media Bartley Fellowships, please submit separate applications for each position.


**Guidelines and Application Deadline:**


Applicants should have direct experience writing, and ideally editing, in a journalism context. A demonstrated ability to multitask and meet daily deadlines is critical for success. Applicants should be familiar with technology as it relates to journalism. Social media experience with a publication or brand would be a plus. Applicants who are able to demonstrate familiarity with our section’s content will be especially attractive (student applicants without campus-wide access to the WSJ can purchase discounted subscriptions at wsj.com/studentoffer).


Students from any discipline may apply, but historically, we’ve been most interested in students concentrating in Journalism, Communications, Economics, Political Science, International Studies, History, a Foreign Language, Statistics, Finance, Pre-Law, Science, Business, Marketing, Religious Studies or Philosophy. Students from outside these disciplines are welcome to apply and should include a three-sentence case in their cover letter for why their field of study would be an asset for the section.


If you’d like to be considered, please submit the following in one single, complete PDF file:


* A cover letter
* Your résumé
* Links to or cited full text of your three best clips
* Your response to one of the following prompts in no more than 600 words

Write an editorial either consistent with the WSJ’s philosophy in response to a current event in the news, or defending your most controversial opinion. Write a sample letter to the editor responding to a recent WSJ editorial, Op-Ed or column. Compare and contrast two opposing arguments from any reliable, professional source(s) on the same topic. Submit an original investigative Op-Ed or original Opinion piece that is suitable in terms of style, tone of voice and topic for publication in the Journal.


All materials must be received by December 2, 2024. Only complete applications that include a cover letter, résumé and prompt responses will be considered. Please do not include any additional materials, such as transcripts, recommendation letters, etc. In order to be considered, you must be a U.S. citizen, or a holder of a green card or visa that will allow you to work in the United States. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis, and we endeavor to make selections by the end of January. Only finalists will be contacted.


**About Bob Bartley**


Throughout his 30 years as The Wall Street Journal’s Editorial Page Editor, Bob Bartley inspired principled and original thinking that changed and shaped the society in which we all live. He also devoted attention to teaching and motivating talented young people, many of whom have gone on to careers in journalism at the Journal and elsewhere. The Bartley fellowships are consistent with that legacy.


Bob Bartley achieved many honors during his long tenure here, including a Pulitzer Prize and, shortly before his death in December 2003, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In awarding that medal, President Bush cited Bob as“one of the most influential journalists in American history.”The Robert L. Bartley fellowships will help to perpetuate not just Bob’s memory but, above all, the principles and priorities to which he devoted his distinguished career.


**About the Opinion Section**


Following the American newspaper practice, the heads of News and Editorial report independently to the publisher of the Journal and CEO of Dow Jones, Almar Latour. The Editorial staff is responsible for the Opinion content published on WSJ.com, the editorial and op-ed pages of The Wall Street Journal in print, and criticism of books and the arts, which are recognized at the Journal as an Opinion function.


While The Wall Street Journal’s news pages are committed to informing our readers, our editorials are dedicated to advocating a consistent philosophy and positions that emanate from it. That philosophy can be summed up as“free markets, free people.”We have stood for these fundamental principles even in times - and places - when they were not considered fashionable. While specific issues differ in various parts of the world, we view those issues through a consistent lens everywhere; for example, while protectionism is more popular in some parts of the world than others, our publications around the world are committed uncompromisingly to free trade.


We believe in the individual, in his wisdom and his decency. We oppose all infringements on individual rights, whether they stem from attempts at private monopoly, labor union monopoly or from an overgrowing government. Our section is not easily pigeonholed or predictable. We resist the label “conservative,” in the sense of preserving the status quo, because we think it too confining, too devoid of the optimism inherent in trusting individual wisdom and decency.


It is also important to state clearly what our section does not represent. It is not partisan. Unlike many American publishers, we do not endorse political candidates, and from time to time we have important disagreements with all leading political figures. We view issues through the lens of our philosophy and let our readers decide which person or party best serves to protect market capitalism and self-government.


We believe that the ultimate function of opinion journalism is the same as the rest of the newspaper, to inform. But in opinion journalism we have the additional purpose of making an argument for a point of view. We often take sides on the major issues of politics and society, with a goal of moving policies or events in what we think is the best direction for the country and world. Our experience over many years is that even those of you who disagree with us on particular issues - or even on broader philosophical grounds - nevertheless respect us for the clarity, consistency and eloquence with which we present our point of view. In stating our own views forcefully, we hope to raise and sharpen the level of debate and knowledge. And we hope that our editorials reflect not merely the passing whim of passing editors, but a body of thought shaped by a century of tradition.

We are proud to be a member of the Rentokil family of companies, the global leader in Pest Control and other services across more than 90 countries. We pride ourselves on being a trusted partner to many of the world's leading brands and serve consumer and business customers across multiple industries. We are extremely proud of our legacy of excellence and constantly work to fulfill our mission to ""protect people, enhance lives, and preserve the planet.""

**Fast-talking, glad-handing, double-dealing slicksters.**
----------------------------------------------------------

**Not our salespeople.**
------------------------


At Terminix Nation, our salespeople are relationship builders and problem solvers. They’re the engine that keeps Terminix running. And we reward them accordingly with a competitive salary and benefits including medical, dental, vision, a 401(k) with company match, and more. There are also opportunities to get trained, gain new skills, and build an awesome career.


But first things first. When you start in sales at Terminix Nation, you’ll get down and dirty. You’ll learn how to inspect and identify infestations (or potential infestations) of all kinds of organisms, insects, birds, and other pests. You’ll learn all about what we do and how you can make your clients’ properties safer and more secure. Once you’ve learned that, you’ll turn your talents to proposals and presentations that result in sales.

**As a Commercial Sales Professional, here’s what you can expect**
------------------------------------------------------------------

* You won’t be tied to a desk. You’ll be out and about — mobile, independent, and growing your career with a clear view of next steps. You’ll be the face of Terminix to your local community (with the backing of a national brand), and your clients will count on you to protect their businesses and livelihoods.
* When you first join Terminix Nation, you’ll spend a few months in training. Once you’ve got that and some state required licenses and certificates under your belt, you’ll take the lead with your own customers.
* You’ll get rewarded with competitive pay and robust benefits to cover you and your family. As a teammate, you will be eligible for a 401(k) with company match, company-paid life insurance, tuition reimbursement, and a generous student loan repayment program. You put in the work, and you’ll reap the rewards.
* You’ll be part of a community — bonus points if you’re already a leader in yours. Our bonds are strong at Terminix Nation and the relationships we develop in the communities we serve are unparalleled. Our teammates give back through volunteering, donations, scholarships, and more.
* You’ll be onboarded and trained by the best of ’em. You’ll get paid to get licensed, something you’ll have for a lifetime. You’ll know how to bust bugs at home, too.

**What your days will look like**
---------------------------------

* Hit the books with training modules and hit the streets with on-the-job training with your teammates. You’ll learn product knowledge and sales techniques for selling the full suite of Terminix products. We’ll train and support you through state licensing and other company requirements.
* You’ll inspect and assess pest problems with precision and suggest Terminix solutions following company policy and pricing instructions.
* You must be obsessed with the customer’s experience — delivering exceptional service, following up to ensure satisfaction, and thinking creatively about how to grow the relationship. You’ll have to be thoughtful about navigating the intricacies of commercial properties and management. And if an account is delinquent, you’ll need to handle that with grace and effectiveness, too.
* Of course, you’ve got to like to sell solutions to problems. You will be expected to meet and greet potential customers to generate new business for the branch.
* There’s an opportunity to grow into a role you’re passionate about and fits your skillset — whether that’s management or another opportunity at Terminix.

**Some non-negotiables**
------------------------


There are some things you’ll just need to have or know to join Terminix Nation as a Commercial Sales Professional.

* A high school education or GED.
* Strong customer service, communication, and critical thinking skills — in fact, we’d be really impressed if you came to this role with related experience and/or training in sales.
* Some basic math skills — add, subtract, multiply, and divide in all units of measure, using whole numbers, common fractions, and decimals. You’ll need to be able to follow instructions for mixing on product labels.

**Straight talk about the physical demands of our work**
--------------------------------------------------------


We’re not going to sugarcoat it. The essential functions of this job have some physical demands (of course, reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the essential functions.) Here’s what we mean:

* You’ve got to be able to move up to 10 lbs. regularly and 11–20 lbs. frequently, whether that’s lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, or otherwise repositioning objects.
* You’ll move around a lot — regularly sitting, climbing, balancing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, and crawling. You’ll go up and down stairs, ladders, scaffolding, ramps, and poles. And you’ll need to keep your balance when walking, standing, or crouching on narrow, slippery, or moving surfaces. (You’ll definitely get your steps in.)
* The vision to perform detail-oriented activities at distances close to the eyes or within arm’s reach.
* Sometimes you’ll need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE), like an OSHA-compliant respirator, and you’ll need to be okay with regularly working in confined spaces, narrow aisles, or passageways (you know, where critters live).


This position offers a base pay plus commission.  

  

* $75k average compensation (base + commission) during first 12 months
* $20.19 - $22.00 during training


  

Actual annual potential is based on individual performance and our top Sales Professionals earn well over $100k annually.
