We seek a diverse cohort of early career scientists who will conduct research in physics, broadly defined to include the subdisciplines of astrophysics, biophysics, and geophysics and planetary physics, independently or in collaboration with Princeton faculty, postdoctoral researchers and students. The Fellowship aims to increase excellence at Princeton by bringing scholars with unique backgrounds and insights, whose work will contribute to the promotion of groups that have been historically, and are presently, under-represented in physics and related fields. Candidates who have demonstrated a strong commitment to remedying the historical under-representation of people of color and women in the physical sciences by promoting inclusion, equity, and diversity through teaching, advising, mentoring, advocacy, or public outreach are especially encouraged to apply.
FFPS Fellows will have a primary home in the Department of Physics, of Astrophysical Sciences, or of Geosciences, and will be part of an actively mentored research community across institutional affiliations, including the Princeton Center for Theoretical Science, the Center for the Physics of Biological Function, the Princeton Gravity Initiative, and other Centers and Programs. The Fellowship includes an annual research fund. Appointments will be made at the postdoctoral or the associate research scholar rank. Postdoctoral appointments will be for one year, renewable annually based on satisfactory performance and funding, for a total of up to three years; associate research scholar appointments will be for three years. The expected starting date is September 1, 2025, although this is flexible. A PhD in the physical sciences or a related field is required.
Interested persons should submit a curriculum vitae, a bibliography, a statement of research interests and plans, and should provide contact information for three references by November 1, 2024, 11:59 pm Eastern Time.

We're sorry, we can not consider remote applicants for this position.

We're looking for entry-level production artists to work for our two growing businesses at our Deer Park, New York studio.

Our studio creates high-quality licensed Star Wars and Indiana Jones collectibles, makes sculpture and theme park props, and also restores original movie props and costumes. Visit www.TomSpinaDesigns.com and www.RegalRobot.com to learn more about what we do. There is always something interesting happening, and you'll be surrounded by cool movie stuff every day.

This is an ENTRY LEVEL position. Experience is a plus but a great attitude and a little skill (in particular with painting miniatures or resin model-making work) will go a long way and you can expect to learn a lot in your time here.

**Our ideal candidate** is someone with hustle, flexibility and a positive attitude.

**This is a product production position, and responsibilities may include:**

* Painting of figurines and prop parts
* Hand paint and airbrush work
* Molding and casting of simple resin parts
* Cleanup (sanding/seaming) of resin parts
* Cleaning/prepping 3D printed parts (training will be provided)

This is a position for someone who understands deadlines, works well with others and doesn’t mind getting their hands dirty. Responsibilities would include production molding/casting/painting of Regal Robot products, and all-around fx style grunt work of all kinds for both companies. It won’t be glamorous work, but the studio is ALWAYS filled with interesting movie stuff… and certainly interesting people.

We are a small team looking for someone who can work well with a diverse group as well as independently. It's a fast paced, casual atmosphere with a fun, creative crew. Responsibilities may shift over time and we're a small shop where everyone is expected to pitch in as needed.

**Ideal candidates should have:**

* An ability to focus, hustle and meet deadlines
* Excellent communication skills and a positive attitude
* Flexibility and a willingness to incorporate notes into your work
* Experience in painting or model-making is a big plus, but not required.

**Some benefits include:**

* Company matched-IRA retirement plan
* Paid Vacation/Personal Days
* Paid Sick days and NYS paid family leave
* Bonus pay
* Growth within the company, annual reviews with merit raises

Our normal hours are Mon-Friday, 10am-6pm. Pay will be determined by experience, skill and expertise in the areas we need.

If you are interested please apply with a resume (and portfolio if you have any art/model-making samples) and let us know why you would be a good fit for our team. Thank you for giving this a look and we look forward to hearing from you!

**Equal Opportunity**  


New York Public Radio is an equal opportunity employer committed to achieving the goal of equal employment opportunity for all.

Created in 2002 by host Jad Abumrad, and now co-hosted by Lulu Miller and Latif Nasser, Radiolab began as an exploration of science, philosophy, and ethics using innovative composition and sound design. Radiolab has expanded and evolved to become a platform for long-form journalism and storytelling. The show challenges its listeners’ preconceived notions about how the world works. Radiolab provokes, it moves, it delights, and it asks its audience to see the world around them anew.  

In the past year, the show released a series on a Guantanamo Bay detainee named Latif Nasser; covered the pandemic (by looking at the present and the past); composed an experimental non-narrative meditation on the end of the world; reported out topical stories on the power of protest (here and here, too), the risk of Donald Trump trying to steal the election, the responsibilities of the police (and lack thereof); and escaped to the bottom of the sea to spend time with an octomom.  

Since its founding nearly two decades ago, Radiolab has won some of the most prestigious awards in journalism, including two George Foster Peabody Awards, Third Coast awards, The Silver Gavel, as well as other accolades. In 2011 Abumrad received the MacArthur Genius grant. The show has spawned successful spinoff series, like More Perfect, Gonads, The Other Latif, G, Border Trilogy, and Radiolab for Kids.
