**Reports to: Division Director**


**Work Location: Office at 180 Myrtle Avenue, Brooklyn NY 11201**


**This position is school based - in the field across multiple DOE schools in the division. Must be able to travel to all work sites in Brooklyn**


**Hours: Full Time Monday - Friday 10am-6pm**


**This position is fully in-person and does not offer any remote work.**


**Salary Range: $70,000 - $75,000**


**BCS partners with people to overcome obstacles on their pathway toward self-determination. Since 1866, founded on the principle of neighbors helping neighbors, BCS has worked in neighborhoods impacted by systemic poverty. Today, we continue to strengthen communities by fostering the educational success of children, the leadership development of youth, the employment and housing stability of adults, the advancement of individuals living with disabilities, and the empowerment of seniors and families. Our work is rooted in the struggle for social justice and through action and advocacy we commit to shine a light on barriers that perpetuate inequitable systems as a part of the collective effort to ignite change. BCS serves more than 20,000 people in 42+ programs through the work of approximately 400 staff and 900 volunteers.**


**Since March 2020, we have witnessed the compounding consequences of social isolation for children/youth with regard to education and mental health. Our children/youth have experienced devastating learning loss and trauma against the backdrop of the pandemic. We are seeing higher rates of incidents relating to mental health challenges, frustrations from educational struggles and behavioral concerns in all of our after-school programs. Young people have fallen deeply behind in their academics and continue to try to process the trauma experienced in the last two years. Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) resources and staff training play a critical role in working with children, youth and parents. Trauma and grief/loss have been profound in our communities and with the families we serve. More than ever, specialized child/youth mental health services are needed to support students through this post-pandemic transition and return to normalcy. The stigma of mental health carries its own set of challenges in our communities; the ability to offer on-site clinical support will lessen the burden placed on struggling families to find support elsewhere.**

Full or half days within the hours of 10-4 pm Monday thru Friday. Monday/Wed/Fri hours most important. Some weekend and evening hours available, if desired. OK, if not.

I am a speech therapist leading a team of other speech therapists and special educators in an innovative homeschool program for my son who has autism.

The role would involve time spent working just with my son, time working with us both, time collaborating, brainstorming, planning, organizing just with me. MUST be interested in thinking deeply about children and their development.

I am looking for someone who is interested in collaborating with me and learning from my son’s team in finding ways to help him learn. This includes natural learning opportunities that occur in daily life, play, and routines as well as adult directed games and support with content learning. We are introducing more and more structure to my son’s life, so formal lessons come into it more and more as appropriate but warmth, engagement, a good relationship, thoughtfulness, flexibility, creativity are more important than fixed ideas or achieving set academic “goals.”

As a big picture thinker, I would welcome the support of someone who can bring more concreteness, organization, planning, and structure to ideas in a process oriented way day to day. We are little by little, building a model “school for one” that can hopefully grow to support other children in families in some way. Our approach is play and relationship based. Different methods work for different families. That said, an ABA mindset is NOT appropriate for this role.

I’m looking for a mature, relational, open minded person who can balance professionalism with the playfulness needed to work with a kid.As this is a unique role, I am interested in collaborating to make it work for the right person. I have been doing this for 6 years and am grateful to have had a lot of success working with different people.

Education experience and credentials strongly preferred but willing to be somewhat flexible for the right fit. Minimum one year commitment. Competitive rate.

This is a great growth opportunity to work with seasoned educators and therapists, interested in advancing the work and understanding of life and education for special needs individuals and their families.

Protein homeostasis mechanisms are essential for compartment function, and their dysregulation can lead to diseases such as neurodegeneration and cancer. We study protein homeostasis at scale throughout structurally complex cells such as neurons, with an emphasis on the Golgi apparatus which is vital for protein processing and cell communication. To enable this work, we leverage cutting edge technologies such as CRISPR, pooled protein tagging, and optical pooled screens. Our research not only seeks to uncover the diverse aspects of protein homeostasis but also aims to harness these pathways via small molecule “glues” or “tacks” to target and modify pathogenic substrates, offering new approaches for disease treatment.  

  

Among the key duties of this position are the following:* Design and lead research projects with support from the supervisor.
* Perform mammalian cell culture techniques (including work with iPSCs and iPSC-derived neurons), microscopy (fixed and live), molecular cloning, biochemical techniques, computational data exploration and analysis, and data presentation.
* Experience with programming in R and/or Python is preferred.
* Engage in scientific communication, training of junior personnel, grant writing, and manuscript preparation.
* Participate in the evaluation of existing procedures, suggesting revisions where necessary and proposing new procedures where required.
* Contribute to the development of performance standards, methodology, and instrumentation, and coordination of the analytical, biochemical, physiology, and instrumentation functions within the research areas to ensure conformance with the goals and objectives of the department. As required, assists in the implementation of the programs and projects in special areas of interest to the department.
* Maintains accurate records of laboratory notebooks and research activity. Reviews literature and prepares manuscripts and abstracts for submission. Presents findings at national meetings.
* May also mentor graduate/undergraduate students.

About Us  


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.  


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.  


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020.

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/U--haul","http://www.uhaul.com/","2727 North Central Avenue

Further information is available at investments.metlife.com.

 **Program Description**: MetLife Investment Management’s Summer Analyst Program is a 10-week hybrid internship program providing participants broad exposure to a global investment manager and a specific asset class of their choosing. Summer analysts will develop various technical and soft skills, have the opportunity to network with professionals across the company, and fully immerse themselves in MIM’s culture.

 **Internship Program Dates**: June 2, 2025 to August 8, 2025 (10 weeks)

 **Opportunity**: Candidates will be able to rank their preferences for placement in the following business units and corresponding locations:

 **Public Fixed Income; PFI (Philadelphia, PA; Whippany, NJ)**: The Public Fixed Income summer analyst will support the trading, portfolio management, credit research, and operations functions of Public Fixed Income. The summer analyst will be introduced to high-yield and investment-grade corporate bond trading, structured product investing, credit research, portfolio analytics, and risk management. Time will be shared, and these groups will be supported in various capacities as needed. Within the program, you will work closely with portfolio managers and senior members of the research and trading groups to obtain a working knowledge of and take an active role in the investment process. Public Fixed Income AUM was $311.8 billion on June 30, 2024.

 **Private Capital (Whippany, NJ)**: The Private Capital department is an industry leader in institutional asset origination, managing over $135.5 billion as of June 30, 2024, across Private Corporates, Private Infrastructure, Residential Mortgage Loans, Alternatives, Middle Market Private Capital, and Private Asset-Backed Securities, and is continuing to experience significant growth. Private Capital strategies seek to invest in high-quality private debt securities that offer attractive yield potential, portfolio diversification, potential downside protection, and asset-liability matching. The summer analyst will be responsible for supporting the Private Capital team, including reporting, analysis, presentations, and ad hoc portfolio-related projects, as well as providing support for the more senior members of the team. Placements will be determined based on candidate interests and business unit matching. Summaries of the business units are below:

* **Investment Grade Private Credit**- Our Investment Grade Private Credit strategies include investments in corporate, private credit, infrastructure debt, and private structured credit issuers that offer portfolio diversification structured for asset-liability matching, managing over $91.3 billion as of June 30, 2024. We invest in credits whose transactions we believe are well structured, properly priced and have sufficient relative value compared to other investment opportunities. We have access to a wide range of investment opportunities that allow us to be selective on deals.

  

o**Corporate Private Credit**—strategy that seeks to originate high-quality private debt with enhanced yield potential and diversification characteristics. Our clients’ investments can be tailored to a wide range of maturities as well as to diversification by risk, country, sector, and currency, and structured as fixed and / or floating-rate debt.


o **Infrastructure**—strategy that provides capital for economic and social infrastructure development. This strategy seeks to originate investment-grade, senior secured notes in fully contracted greenfield and brownfield entities with strong track records.


o **Private Structured Credit**—strategy revolves around investing in privately originated asset-backed opportunities across the capital structure. It emphasizes intricate, tailor-made transactions designed to enhance returns while mitigating potential losses. The team maintains sector flexibility and pursues investments in securitization (Asset-Backed Securities) transactions where substantial value is identified. They seek strong risk-adjusted returns on predominately investment-grade investments while opportunistically adding non-investment-grade investments with the goal of enhancing overall returns.


o **Client Portfolio Management**—The client portfolio management (“CPM”) team’s primary responsibility is to understand the client’s private asset objectives, create a mandate and working relationship with the clients to achieve those objectives, and work with the MIM private deal teams to build and monitor the client’s private portfolio.

* **Middle Markets**—The Middle Market Private Capital strategy seeks to offer investors access to privately negotiated debt and minority-equity investment transactions, primarily in North American middle-market companies. Investments include senior, unitranche, and second-lien loans, mezzanine notes, and equity co-investments. Middle Market Private Capital AUM was $1.5 billion on June 30, 2024.

* **Private Equity**—Private Equity Strategy seeks to deliver consistent, attractive long-term private equity returns, both on an absolute basis and relative to industry benchmarks. MetLife’s Private Equity portfolio is invested globally across a broad range of sub sectors, including leveraged buyouts, venture capital, growth equity, special situations, and equity co-investments.

* **Residential Whole Loans**—The Residential Whole Loan strategy seeks to offer investors access to an actively managed residential loan portfolio that aims to generate attractive income relative to traditional fixed-income sectors. U.S Residential Mortgage Loan AUM was $18.4 billion on June 30, 2024.

 **MetLife Insurance Investments; MII (Whippany, NJ)**: MII provides the insurer investment function for MetLife’s general account. Key to this function is developing an asset allocation strategy that enables the matching of investment assets with the liabilities needed to fulfill MetLife’s obligation to customers at some point in the future. The general account portfolio is primarily comprised of fixed-income securities, but it also includes real estate and other equity investments. MII collaborates with its asset manager, MetLife Investment Management, to execute the strategy within a relative value framework, balancing current income and total return needs. The summer analyst will work with the MII team to analyze and implement investment strategies that help achieve earnings, growth, and risk management objectives, as well as assist in building reports to support the investment process.

 **Institutional Client Group; ICG (Philadelphia, PA; Whippany, NJ)**: The Institutional Client Group is responsible for driving the firm’s strategy and business development efforts with institutional investors globally. As a summer analyst, the candidate will work closely with team members, investment professionals, and other key stakeholders in a range of responsibilities related to growing the client business. This includes maintaining and enhancing a CRM system, sourcing prospective investors, researching competitor products, summarizing large datasets, assisting with various business strategy initiatives, and coordinating client/prospect meeting logistics and follow-ups.

 **Insurance Asset Management; IAM (Whippany, NJ)**: MetLife Investment Management (MIM) was launched in 2012 to capitalize on our strong investment management performance for our General Account. The summer analyst will support the management of MetLife Holdings and Corporate & Other Segments. MetLife Holdings portfolios back run-off liabilities such as Life, Annuities, and Long-Term Care. The Corporate & Other segment contains mostly surplus, reinsurance, and hold-co portfolios. The summer analyst will provide ad hoc analysis on various portfolios or other topics. Additionally, the summer analyst will utilize tools such as BlackRock Aladdin, Excel, Bloomberg, and other tools to analyze portfolio issues.

 **Office of the CIO; OCIO (Whippany, NJ)**: The Office of the CIO provides a unique and exciting opportunity to thoroughly understand how the Investments Department’s investment strategy and process come together. The summer analyst in this role will work directly with MetLife Investment Management (MIM) Management Committee members and MetLife Insurance Investments (MII) Senior Leadership Team members. The candidate will compile high-level analyses of critical portfolio information for use by the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) and his direct reports, the Executive Leadership Team (ELT), MetLife’s Investment Committee of the Board of Directors, and MetLife shareholders.

 **Operations (Whippany, NJ)**: The Client Services Group in Operations creates and delivers client reporting related to MIM’s global product agenda, with a mandate to deliver products that support both clients’ needs and business growth objectives. The team also serves as a critical connector for MIM’s clients and Product Strategy to ensure we are delivering on our promises.
