**About Us:**



Founded in 2017 by Carolyn Witte and Felicity Yost, Tia is the modern medical home for women. We are trailblazing a new paradigm for women's healthcare that treats women as whole people vs. parts or life stages. Blending in-person and virtual care services, Tia's ""Whole Woman, Whole Life"" care model fuses gynecology, primary care, mental health and evidence-based wellness services to treat women comprehensively. By making women's health higher quality and lower cost, Tia makes women healthier, providers happier, and the business of care delivery stronger — setting a new standard of care for women everywhere.



Tia has raised more than $132 Million in venture capital funding to date, including a recent $100 Million Series B investment, one of the largest early-stage rounds ever for a healthcare company focused on women. Tia has ambitious plans to scale its ""whole-woman, whole-life"" model to more than 100,000 women by 2023. We'll do this by growing virtual and in-person operations in existing and new markets while expanding its service lines to care for women throughout their entire lives - from puberty to menopause. Since launching in 2017, Tia has grown to serve thousands of women aged 18-80 with blended in-person and virtual care in New York City, Los Angeles, Phoenix and soon San Francisco.



We're building a world class team to reimagine women's healthcare. We're an interdisciplinary team of clinicians, researchers, designers, technologists and operators who have seen firsthand how broken the healthcare system is for women. We're united by a powerful mission to enable every woman to achieve optimal health, as defined by herself, as well as a shared set of values and principles that define our business, products, and culture.



Tia is building a culture of **excellence** — in people, process and product. This is our northstar value;


*What is excellence, exactly?*



Excellence about constantly elevating yourself, it is the process of constantly striving to perform to the best of your abilities, and identifying your top potential through constant learning, experimentation and evolution. Excellence is not about achieving perfection, as that insinuates a pinnacle. Instead, in our terms, excellence is about the pursuit of constant improvement. We're looking for people who want to go on that hard journey of constantly setting new personal records, and organizational records.



We practice excellence at Tia by demonstrating the following types of behaviors: We chose (and actively choose) excellence as Tia's highest order value because it crystalizes into one word several behaviors that we hold dear, specifically:



* A drive to **constantly improve through experimentation**, reflection. and an insatiable growth mindset — said another way, we're energized by the possibility of invention, innovation, and iteration


* **Being present in and grateful for the journey** — not just the goal line. Perfection is static. Excellence is a process (more on this important distinction below)


* **Asking why, then why again** — because accepting ""this is just the way it is"" is not good enough


* **Grit & perseverance** — a maker mentality that involves ""rolling up your sleeves"", *but also* deep care for oneself and for others


* **A commitment to uncovering talents** to unlock ""rock star"" potential across every individual



Furthermore, excellence reflects the ""bigness"" and the ""boldness"" of Tia's mission and vision — a world in which every woman can achieve optimal health, as defined by herself.



Said another way, Tia's mission is NOT to make healthcare *incrementally better* for women. Instead, we've intentionally set out to create a fundamentally new paradigm for modern women's healthcare that's truly *excellent*. We believe that creating a company that operates in a culture of excellence will manifest in our product. Reaching this goal is not an overnight pursuit or a ""one and done."" We have not and will not ""get it right"" with the first swing. Rather, this higher order goal is a moving target — one we have not and will not ever fully ""achieve."" By design, we will never be ""done"" with this work, but instead, we will be continuously in pursuit of our mission. It is this continuous pursuit — the journey, not the finish line — that truly embodies excellence.


*This position may require attendance at company and team off-sites and is subject the Company's vaccine requirement, as permitted by law and subject to reasonable accommodation.*


*Tia is an equal opportunity employer. We are proud to foster a workplace free from discrimination. We strongly believe that diversity of experience, perspectives, and background will lead to a better environment for our employees and a better product for our users and patients. We strongly encourage people of color and members of the LGBTQ+ community to apply.*

**Who We Are**



East Harlem Scholars Academies are community-based Pre-K to 12 public charter schools operated by East Harlem Tutorial Program (EHTP). EHTP began in 1958 as a children's reading group and has since grown into a multi-site after-school program for traditional public school students and a network of public charter schools focused on significantly increasing the college graduation rate in East Harlem. We are on track to serve at least 25% of East Harlem students by 2025, with enrollment for this year at approximately 2200 students in our schools and after school programs. In 2020, 99% of our seniors were accepted to college, and our current scholars in college are on-track to graduate at eight times the national average of their peers.



At EHTP we also aim to serve as an agent of change and thoughtfully contribute to the national fight for racial equity. Through our organization-wide commitment to anti-racism work, we prepare our scholars to effect change, challenge the status quo, and thrive in the world around them. As staff members, we face our own racial identities and conscious and unconscious biases. With this in mind, all of our professional development, curriculum, organizational materials, and processes are designed with a goal of racial justice. Read our racial equity statement **here**.



We ground all of our work in racial equity, **in our core values**, and in our four guiding pursuits: the Revolutionary Pursuit of Love, the Radical Pursuit of Knowledge, the Responsive Pursuit of Healing, and in the Relentless Pursuit of Results. These pursuits inform and are reflected in our current four key strategic priorities: to increase high-impact, high-quality academic curriculum, programming content, staff capacity, and coaching; to embrace and advance our use of technology; to deepen our embodiment of ethical and equitable radical humanity; and to efficiently operationalize teaching, learning, community, and care.

**About the Opportunity**



As an History Teacher with Scholars Academies, you will be student facing the majority of the day. You will work closely with the instructional leadership team to internalize, and in some cases develop curriculum; provide high-quality instruction; track and measure student progress; create a positive classroom and school culture, and to engage in reflection and continuous improvement. You will also be asked to act as a class advisor for our community of students, providing mentor and support during their middle school career. As a team we will work together to prepare students with the skills, strength of character and emotional well-being to excel academically, lead in their communities, and realize their best possible selves.

**About the Role:**



Industrious is at an incredible inflection point. We have around 200 locations across North America, Europe, and Asia, and are a profitable company. The next frontier for the company involves 3 main things: 1) doubling down on accelerating our growth 2) a heavy investment in new products / businesses that will continue to position Industrious as the market leader in flexible workplace, and 3) driving toward an IPO in the next 2-3 years.



The Chief of Staff plays a huge role in this! The role sits in the middle of what the company goals are, and how the company executes to achieve them. On one end, the Chief of Staff helps facilitate debate between the executive team regarding company strategy, and on the other end, they roll up their sleeves and take on big parts of the execution.



The role also involves supporting others and helping the whole organization succeed. This is primarily through 1-on-1 coaching and support for leaders of the company, and being the driver of the Industrious culture, and how that culture comes to life day-to-day.



The Chief of Staff role at Industrious reports to the CEO and is leveled as a Senior Director. Ideal candidates have experience in senior roles at high-growth businesses, or heavily cross-functional roles at medium or large-sized companies.



This role is perfect for someone who wants to learn a ton about how startups scale from the best seat in the house!


**You are a great fit for this role if:**


* **You have strong financial acumen -** you are able to read and understand financial statements and build simple financial models. You will play a key role alongside our CEO and EVP of Finance in fundraising, M&A, and other exciting, but financially complex endeavors.
* **You are able to program-solve major strategy challenges -** you can break down a complex problem, frame up logical thinking, analyze relevant information, and make a clear and comprehensive recommendation to the CEO
* **You can lead large cross-functional projects -** you have the organizational and people skills to run a project with a number of senior stakeholders from around the organization
* **You can replace Jamie in high-stakes meetings -** meetings with landlords, clients, investors, or board members
* **You easily build trust with others and you are a connector** - you've been told you have high EQ, and you tend to form genuine relationships with others very quickly. You are a pro at influencing, and supporting other teams to do what they do better and better every day.
* **You're ethical, thoughtful, and comfortable telling your boss** **why they're wrong**. You have a strong sense of what feels right and wrong and don't hold back in sharing your thoughts with other leaders and peers.
* **You don't mind being in a supporting role** - you like the idea of having the bird's eye view of Industrious, working closely with our CEO and other leaders, and having a massive impact on the company, but are comfortable doing so in a role that is sometimes very visible, but at others more behind-the-scenes.


**Scope of the role:**


* Represent the CEO in meetings, guiding teams on their strategic decisions, sharing insights from the executive team, and suggesting actionable next steps
* Play a supporting role in financial and business analysis related to fundraising & M&A

*Jean-Georges Restaurant opened in 1997 to critical acclaim. The jewel of Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten's empire, the restaurant offers the very best in fine dining. Consistently awarded four stars by the New York Times and three Michelin stars, Jean-Georges presents exquisitely crafted dishes blending French, American, and Asian influences. The local farmer's market is the driving force behind the seasonal, ever-changing menu. Chef Jean-Georges is a master at maintaining the essence of ingredients while using them inventively to produce the best flavor. Jean-Georges' chic and intimate dining room was redesigned by Thomas Juul-Hansen, with striking lighting by L'Observatoire. Impeccable service, tableside preparations, and floor-to-ceiling windows with stunning views of Central Park and Columbus Circle all contribute to an unforgettable dining experience.*
