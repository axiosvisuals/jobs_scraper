* 5+ years of relevant experience in financial services (e.g., Consulting, Program/Project Management, Banking (Client Front Office, Underwriting, Portfolio Management, Credit Analysis, etc.), ratings agency, regulatory organization) or a graduate degree plus approximately 3+ years of related work experience
* Strong written and verbal communication, presentation, client service, and problem-solving skills, coupled with a strong interest in further developing industry and deep content knowledge in the Credit Risk space
* Ability to travel – you will likely spend a significant amount of time on-site with our clients. This travel can be as much as 80% to 100% of a work week at times
* A willingness to operate under a hybrid work environment (typically 40 to 60% of the week in an EY office with your team when not on-site with a client)

  

 Ideally, you’ll also have experience in:

* Consulting experience with a Big 4 firm or large global financial institution
* Strong understanding of the credit lifecycle (e.g., sales/origination, underwriting, fulfillment, servicing, loan accounting, monitoring, and default)
* Experience working as part of a cross-functional or multi-disciplinary team
* Strong executive presentation skills, with the ability to influence peers and management
* Ability to manage and supervise a program or team through all phases of the project lifecycle
