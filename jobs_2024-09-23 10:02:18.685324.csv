At Charles Tyrwhitt our purpose is to “Make it easy for men to dress well” and we can’t do that without our sales team.


Join us at our exciting new store opening in Belmont Park Village in early January 2025.


We're looking to hire enthusiastic individuals to join us starting in early November, helping us prepare for our big launch. Don't miss this opportunity to be part of our growing family and make a mark right from the start!

**What you will be doing**


You will be responsible for providing exceptional customer service and be the touch point for each and every customer. Our Sales Associates will be provided training to support our clients with styling and fit advice, as well as tailoring and custom product sales service. Your natural interest in providing exceptional service will mean you always put the customer first, providing a warm welcome to our shop, always representing the CT Brand. Your role will also include general store operations such as restocking, shipment, and customer sales.

**What we are looking for**


We are looking for a confident Sales Associate who can connect with our customers, deliver excellence in customer experience, and offer advice on current trends relevant to our clientele. Previous experience in a similar position is a huge advantage to this role. Interest in menswear is necessary, plus training is provided to help you understand our brand.

**What you can expect from us**


CT is a privately-owned business, so we're not a big corporate-style place to work. Our senior leaders are transparent and approachable, and we welcome ideas to make this a great place to work. We value our people whilst being product and customer obsessed.

* Quarterly bonus based on team sales performance
* Part-time paid sick leave!
* Uniform allowance
* PayActiv partnership - get wages already earned before payday
* Employee discount
* Other leave and Time off policies

This is an hourly (non-exempt) role based in Elmont, NY. The pay range for this role is based on experience and we might reasonably expect to offer $17.00 - $18.00 per hour.

**Who we are**


Once upon a shirt, Nicholas Charles Tyrwhitt Wheeler had the notion that he could make a better shirt at better value than anyone else in the world! He believed that all men; no matter their shape or size, where they may be in the world or indeed their budget; should be able to own a Jermyn Street quality shirt. A proper shirt. A CT shirt.


That was over 3 decades ago and whilst Charles Tyrwhitt (it rhymes with spirit by the way) is still famous for proper shirts, these days we are about so much more than collars and cuffs. Our purpose is to “make it easy for men to dress well”. We take care of the entire wardrobe, providing stylish solutions for every occasion. We make sure he gets what he wants, when and how he wants it.


Charles Tyrwhitt’s spiritual home and flagship store is located on London’s Jermyn Street, in the United Kingdom where our presence is well know. We also have a strong online presence in the US, with retail stores in 7 states and a New York head office. We also operate across Europe and Australia! Pretty impressive, eh? And as of 2022, we're proud to be recognized as a carbon-neutral retailer as we continue our journey to be a sustainable business.
