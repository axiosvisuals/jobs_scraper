--------------------------------

  


Since 2016, Correctional Health Services (CHS) has been the direct provider of health care in the New York City jails. Deeply committed to human dignity and patient rights, CHS is part of the NYC Health + Hospitals system and is a key partner in the City’s efforts to reform the criminal-legal system. Our in-jail clinical services include medical, nursing, and mental health care; pharmacy services; substance-use treatment; social work; dental and vision care; discharge planning; and reentry support.

  

Given the high visibility of this initiative, we are seeking the highest caliber health care professionals in key clinical services to staff our Outposted Therapeutic Housing Units (OTxHU). To be located in three NYC Health + Hospital acute care facilities, the OTxHU is a pioneering approach to safely increasing access to high quality clinical care for patients in custody who have complicated health conditions. OTxHUs will bridge the gap in the continuum between care provided in the jails and inpatient hospitalization, with admission to and discharge from the OTxHU in accordance with a patient’s clinical needs. CHS will be the primary health care providers on these units and the NYC Department of Correction will provide security and custody management.

  

The OTxHU at NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue in Manhattan will be the first of this unique, groundbreaking project to open with a planned completion date as early as the end of 2024. This is an incredible opportunity to be part of a passionate and motivated team providing care to some of the City’s most marginalized, vulnerable people.

* To help support continuity of operations and care, staff selected to work in the OTxHU may also be required to work in CHS locations within the jails. Additionally, while CHS seeks the most qualified individuals for these positions, preference will be given to equally qualified, internal candidates.

* Providing appointments and referrals to community medical, mental health and/or substance use treatment as clinically indicated.
* Providing referrals for appropriate case management services, including, but not limited to completing SPOA applications.
* Completing applications for benefits, including Medicaid, social security, and public assistance.
* Completing supportive housing applications for eligible individuals and pursuing other housing opportunities for all patients in need.
* Engaging in appropriate communication and collaboration with community providers and legal representatives, including facilitating case conferences with community-based providers.
* Serving as conduit between patients and clinical court advocates, and assisting with obtaining consents, relaying information, and other related tasks.
* Processing discharges by providing individuals leaving with medications, aftercare letters, referrals to community treatment, and Medication Grant Program (MGP) cards when indicated.
* Participating in supervision, trainings, and other departmental meetings.
* Ensuring compliance with accepted social work practices and principles and operational adherence to government rules and regulations, including compliance with reporting requirements.
* Documenting all activities in the electronic health record.

New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation

**Outposted Therapeutic Housing Units Program (OTxHU)**


Since 2016, Correctional Health Services (CHS) has been the direct provider of health care in the New York City jails. Deeply committed to human dignity and patient rights, CHS is part of the NYC Health + Hospitals system and is a key partner in the City’s efforts to reform the criminal-legal system. Our in-jail clinical services include medical, nursing, and mental health care; pharmacy services; substance-use treatment; social work; dental and vision care; discharge planning; and reentry support.


Given the high visibility of this initiative, we are seeking the highest caliber health care professionals in key clinical services to staff our Outposted Therapeutic Housing Units (OTxHU). To be located in three NYC Health + Hospital acute care facilities, the OTxHU is a pioneering approach to safely increasing access to high quality clinical care for patients in custody who have complicated health conditions. OTxHUs will bridge the gap in the continuum between care provided in the jails and inpatient hospitalization, with admission to and discharge from the OTxHU in accordance with a patient’s clinical needs. CHS will be the primary health care providers on these units and the NYC Department of Correction will provide security and custody management.


The OTxHU at NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue in Manhattan will be the first of this unique, groundbreaking project to open with a planned completion date as early as the end of 2024. This is an incredible opportunity to be part of a passionate and motivated team providing care to some of the City’s most marginalized, vulnerable people.

* To help support continuity of operations and care, staff selected to work in the OTxHU may also be required to work in CHS locations within the jails. Additionally, while CHS seeks the most qualified individuals for these positions, preference will be given to equally qualified, internal candidates.
