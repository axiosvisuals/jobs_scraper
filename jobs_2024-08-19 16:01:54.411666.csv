Our Affinity strategy places a focus on prospects that are global in nature, have multi-country clients, and have a mass volume customer base. The current target industry segments are car dealers and manufacturers, energy utilities, financial services, and mobile network operators. A role in affinity is suited to individuals who have an interest in building sales and marketing platforms for distribution of products and services in addition to the broking/ placement of the insurance.

**About One World Project**

is a Spanish-immersion **community center** in the Windsor Terrace neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY.

We are a Welcoming Community of Learners. We nurture **global citizens and environmental stewardship** throughout all our programs and community events, including but not limited to: Spanish-immersion preschool, after school, camps, Saturday playgroups, and parenting education. We believe education is transformative.

All of our **teachers are fluent in Spanish**, and many are heritage Spanish speakers. Our learning community is a mix of Spanish-dominant, English-dominant, and bilingual families. While children may speak in whatever language is comfortable for them, we ask that teachers communicate only in Spanish, except when absolutely necessary.

At OWP, we place **special emphasis on social-emotional learning**, looking for ways in which we all feel safe and ready to take risks and learn together. We set up engaging and developmentally appropriate inside and outside learning environments for children to explore, play and learn. We are a play-based, hands-on school and use an emergent play-based curricular approach.

OWP is **committed to an Anti-Bias educational** **approach** that promotes curiosity for each other, self-reflection, and a deep appreciation of diversity and justice within our community and the world. This lens shapes all we do at OWP.

We pay **special attention to the natural world** and want for all of us to have experiences that make us feel deeply connected to nature. We thoughtfully develop and embrace strategies and practices to minimize negative impact on our natural environment.

**Role**

The Preschool Assistant Teacherworks with other faculty and staff to implement our preschool program with students ages 2-5.

We ask assistant teachers to be an **active member of their classroom team**. This means being both an active observer and listener, expressing ideas, and being open to discussing our differences. We communicate about conflicts, and look for solutions together that align with OWP’s mission and best practices.

The assistant teacher will receive direct **supervision**, as well as ongoing support and feedback, **from the lead teacher in their classroom**. Beyond this, there is a supervision support team as well. Teachers will have the opportunity to meet individually with the Education Director, and periodically with the Executive Director to build their teaching skills and to ensure their classroom and team are moving One World Project’s mission and vision forward.

All teachers are also asked to participate in **frequent paid professional development opportunities** that will continue to build their teaching and leadership skills.

The position also offers **opportunities to learn and grow**, with the chance to become a Lead Teacher for an OWP classroom. Assistant teachers will gain a deep understanding of early childhood development and language acquisition, as well as the skills to lead Spanish-immersion programs for children ages 2 to 5 years old.

* Observing and recording students’ actions, interactions, and development in relation to the curriculum;
* Supporting the development of the children and program by working closely with the Lead Teacher to prepare and maintain a classroom environment that responds to children’s skills, interests, and needs (including diapering!)
* Learning the classroom routines and assuming a shared responsibility for managing the flow of the day and planning for smooth and meaningful transitions.
* Asking questions and engaging in ongoing dialogue with peers and supervisors about how to be responsive to the children's interests and needs.

**Curriculum Design & Collaboration**

* Collaborating on and critically analyzing units of study with the Lead Teacher;
* Participating in weekly team meetings and planning efforts for the classroom that allow ample time for reflection between units of study to consider areas of improvement, discuss student observations, and incorporate opportunity in the next cycle (i.e. parent resources, new materials, possible trips);
* Participating in weekly staff meetings to share ideas, best practices, and challenges that ensure a strong connection between classrooms and programs.
* Collaborating in the design of a clear distribution of the responsibilities (zoning), both inside and outside the classroom. The system should reflect and maximize the strengths of each member of the team.
* Collaboration in the planning of a contingency plan for absences, so the whole team feels confident and ready when any member is absent.

**Administration & Outreach**

I need people that have worked with animals before and that have basic understandings of their behaviors and how to handle them. We deal with all animals big and small of all behaviors (again you will not be expected to do something you are uncomfortable with). Here is a quote from one of my employees so you have reassurance coming from someone that works for me rather than me just hyping up my own business:
