==========================

### **Job Summary:**


This is an intensely collaborative role with the Regional Director of Clinical Operations (RDCO).

* Assist in coordinating rounding schedule with Providers and Facilities (minimum twice weekly visits in every facility)

	+ Quality patient care and clinical effectiveness
	+ Effectiveness and efficiency of clinical rounds, following appropriate care models, processes, and standardized procedures of LTC Healing Partners

* Perform regular check-ins (no less than monthly) with facilities and regional nursing leadership to ensure strong and positive relationships are established and maintained on behalf of LTC Healing Partners

Assist RDCO with planning & coordination for new facility contracts and provider placement * - Strategic employment of providers throughout the region should be discussed with senior management before significant changes are made due to preexisting agreements and client requests
