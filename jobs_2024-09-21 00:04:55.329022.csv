**Who We Are**



East Harlem Scholars Academies are community-based Pre-K to 12 public charter schools operated by East Harlem Tutorial Program (EHTP). EHTP began in 1958 as a children's reading group and has since grown into a multi-site after-school program for traditional public school students and a network of public charter schools focused on significantly increasing the college graduation rate in East Harlem. We are on track to serve at least 25% of East Harlem students by 2025, with enrollment for this year at approximately 2200 students in our schools and after school programs. In 2020, 99% of our seniors were accepted to college, and our current scholars in college are on-track to graduate at eight times the national average of their peers.



At EHTP we also aim to serve as an agent of change and thoughtfully contribute to the national fight for racial equity. Through our organization-wide commitment to anti-racism work, we prepare our scholars to effect change, challenge the status quo, and thrive in the world around them. As staff members, we face our own racial identities and conscious and unconscious biases. With this in mind, all of our professional development, curriculum, organizational materials, and processes are designed with a goal of racial justice. Read our racial equity statement **here**.



We ground all of our work in racial equity, **in our core values**, and in our four guiding pursuits: the Revolutionary Pursuit of Love, the Radical Pursuit of Knowledge, the Responsive Pursuit of Healing, and in the Relentless Pursuit of Results. These pursuits inform and are reflected in our current four key strategic priorities: to increase high-impact, high-quality academic curriculum, programming content, staff capacity, and coaching; to embrace and advance our use of technology; to deepen our embodiment of ethical and equitable radical humanity; and to efficiently operationalize teaching, learning, community, and care.



For more information about Scholars Academies, please visit us at www.eastharlemscholars.org.

As a teacher with Scholars Academies you will be student facing the majority of the day. You will work closely with your grade team and the instructional leadership team to internalize, and in some cases develop, curriculum; provide high-quality instruction; track and measure student progress; create a positive classroom and school culture, and to engage in reflection and continuous improvement. As a team we will work together to prepare students with the skills, strength of character, and emotional well-being to excel academically, lead in their communities, and realize their best possible selves.

Our client, ff Venture Capital, is a seed-first, high-touch venture capital firm that believes deeply in collaboration to help early-stage companies build technology that will change the experiences of millions of people. They have an office in New York and an office in Warsaw, Poland.

**About the role**

ff is looking to add an Associate to their team who will work with our US partners. The Associate will be hands-on with investment and fund operational processes, with the aim of helping accelerate the growth of our portfolio companies and reporting the results back to our Limited Partners.

This role will extend across all functions, including the following:

* Financial modeling and performance of “what-if analyses”;
* Maintaining records of portfolio company investments, including maintenance of capitalization tables and valuations in connection with quarterly reporting;
* Assuring portfolio company compliance with reporting and other obligations;
* Reviewing new investment opportunities, special projects, portfolio engagement, communications;
* Ad hoc analyses; and
* Some administrative responsibilities.

The position requires a balance between critical thinking, creativity, and thorough execution. In total, it involves responsibilities and exposures to all aspects of the Partners’ professional lives. The opportunity is broader than a traditional Associate role at a Venture Capital firm, and past holders of this role have gone on to senior positions at other firms as well as CXOs at startups.

We have moved to a hybrid office/home approach. We believe that being NYC-based is an advantage given the vibrant community here.

**Responsibilities will include:**

* Engagement with the quarterly portfolio company valuation process and LP reporting;
* Being hyper connected into the NYC and US venture community;
* Managing and tracking communications and relationships within the firm, founder community, and partner networks;
* Initiating and leading special projects;
* Qualifying, managing, and tracking new investment opportunities with an understanding of the Investing Partner’s goals and expertise;
* Conducting research and diligence on potential investments;
* Creating analysis for presentation to Partners;
* Keeping an ear to the ground on trends in our portfolio and our industries of focus;
* Managing partner projects, events, meetings and engagements, and accompanying logistics;
* Representing the Partnership at company meetings and other events, and reporting back on key information and insights; and
* Other responsibilities that will come up that could add exceptional value for our founders.

**This position is not:**

* A standard associate position — the work, rather, includes fantastic opportunities to dive into the NYC tech ecosystem from the Partner’s perspective and learn what it takes to run a firm and support the growth of startups;
* Sourcing-focused. Instead, these positions are focused on helping our partners effectively examine and prioritize our current deal flow; and
* All alluring. Partners’ work lives include everything from heavy time on emails to setting up travel for board meetings, managing calendars to tracking expenses. This role will ask you to spend a non-trivial amount of time doing the same. It takes a lot of logistical thinking, execution, and diving in on processes to make everything work overall.

**Whom we are seeking:**

* A “quantitative-oriented” person over a “qualitative-oriented” person;
* Yet also a connector;
* Someone with venture capital experience would be helpful, but is not required. A variety of backgrounds could set you up for this role, including having experience in media, startups, finance, law, and consulting. If it’s been fast-paced, and you’ve learned how to execute, that is what matters most; and
* You might be a driven project manager with a laser-focus on execution, a generalist who cannot stop thinking about tech, an accountant or financial analyst looking for a challenging opportunity or a future entrepreneur who wants to gain a deep insight on the other side of the table.

**How you would describe yourself:**

* You might not come from venture capital, but you have a passion to learn about the field and an eagerness to do so fast;
* You can get things done fast and with an eagle’s eye for execution - the details matter to you. You are completely reliable, and exceptionally organized;
* You believe deeply in teamwork, who can take initiative when you see opportunities to build value;
* You are a creative thinker who can deftly apply logic and analysis to make a case, asking the questions that are needed, listening and learning along the way; and
* You intuitively know how to communicate across a variety of contexts — when the situation calls for concision and clarity, a reconciliation of information, or an assertion of judgment, whether it is with veteran founders, seasoned investors, or experienced CEOs.
