New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation

**Outposted** **Therapeutic** **Housing Units Program (OTxHU)**


Since 2016, Correctional Health Services (CHS) has been the direct provider of health care in the New York City jails. Deeply committed to human dignity and patient rights, CHS is part of the NYC Health + Hospitals system and is a key partner in the City’s efforts to reform the criminal-legal system. Our in-jail clinical services include medical, nursing, and mental health care; pharmacy services; substance-use treatment; social work; dental and vision care; discharge planning; and reentry support.




Given the high visibility of this initiative, we are seeking the highest caliber health care professionals in key clinical services to staff our Outposted Therapeutic Housing Units (OTxHU). To be located in three NYC Health + Hospital acute care facilities, the OTxHU is a pioneering approach to safely increasing access to high quality clinical care for patients in custody who have complicated health conditions. OTxHUs will bridge the gap in the continuum between care provided in the jails and inpatient hospitalization, with admission to and discharge from the OTxHU in accordance with a patient’s clinical needs. CHS will be the primary health care providers on these units and the NYC Department of Correction will provide security and custody management.




The OTxHU at NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue in Manhattan will be the first of this unique, groundbreaking project to open with a planned completion date as early as the end of 2024. This is an incredible opportunity to be part of a passionate and motivated team providing care to some of the City’s most marginalized, vulnerable people.

* To help support continuity of operations and care, staff selected to work in the OTxHU may also be required to work in CHS locations within the jails. Additionally, while CHS seeks the most qualified individuals for these positions, preference will be given to equally qualified, internal candidates.

Who We Are
Night Market’s mission is to break down siloes between consulting, advertising and eCommerce to help bring brands to the forefront of their industries, improving eCommerce innovation, execution and performance. Our core difference lies at the intersection of media and eCommerce, where we employ data-driven insights to define and activate strategies that optimize the full consumer path to purchase in order to achieve desired business outcomes
At Night Market, we understand the value that different skills, experiences and perspectives can bring to our clients and culture, so we strive for an environment where our employees feel welcomed, safe and empowered. We value YOU and believe that your authentic voice and unique perspective allows us to create a more rewarding culture, and experience, together.
Our simple recipe for success?
We hire talented people (thinkers, doers, dreamers, makers), challenge them and give them every opportunity to grow.
As part of our growing business, we are building our in-house creative capabilities to serve our clients’ needs for quality and high-performance digital creative.
The Job:
As a NIGHT MARKET Junior Writer, your primary responsibility will be to apply your skills as a wordsmith, to listen actively, and to synthesize information into short but compelling headlines, sentences, phrases, captions, prompts, and (but not limited to) calls-to-action on the page. This role will predominantly focus on web-based copy, but there is always a need for good thinking, great editing skills, even better grammar, and amazing writing across the full scope of Night Market work.
Main Duties and Responsibilities
50% - Writing, listening, editing:* Write engaging and functional copy for a variety of websites and complementary channels including, but not limited to social and app-based platforms, traditional print, out-of-home and experiential media, and event collateral (in-store, on-site)
* Update and/or edit existing website copy for clients, which may include providing several options for A/B testing, as well as provide new copy versions that may not be specifically asked for in the brief.
* Write copy that aligns with tone of voice guidelines for clients and internal teams.
* Edit both internal documents and presentation decks, for Night Market and clients.
* Listen and take direction within briefing and reviews, and always ask questions if the direction is unclear.
* At times you may collaborate with an Art Director, Designer, another Writer, and sometimes a Strategist or Account Person.
* You will also participate in concepting ideas, brainstorms, and perhaps even free writing exercises as set by the Creative Directors.


50% - Ideas & Ambition:* At a junior level, we do not expect you to have a full portfolio of real, out-in-the-world, accolated work, but we do expect that you have the desire and drive to want to create it with effectiveness and craft.
* Beyond writing, we expect ideas: ideas on how to answer the brief and ideas on how to improve the work; perhaps ideas that may sound crazy but are backed up with some kind of reasoning or insight.
* You may not know exactly how to complete a project, or where to start, but you have a willingness to figure it out, and to ask questions of your manager/s, team-mates, and cross-department colleagues.
* You will be prepared to work hard. In this job, what you learn and how you thrive is mostly dependent on your attitude and actions. For everything else, you can seek help from your manager.


Knowledge and Skills Required* 2+ years' experience as writer in an agency, brand, or platform environment
* Interest in writing styles, types of writing output (like films, books, websites, apps etc.) and contemporary culture
* Must have a solid grasp of spelling, grammar, and copy-editing.
* Strong communication skills to convey ideas and written work.
* Confidence in presenting and expressing opinion.
* Knowledgeable in the areas of websites, search, and social, while keeping abreast of new and emerging technology
* Able to use Word, PowerPoint, Outlook and Teams, have some degree of understanding for design programs like Adobe Suite and Figma


Certificates, Licenses and Registrations* There are no requirements for certificates, licenses and registrations.


Physical Activity and Work Environment* Position does not involve physical activity other than being present at the office at least once a week.


Salary Range: $1,200.00 to 1,442.31 a week. A successful applicant’s actual weekly or hourly rate may vary based upon, but not limited to, skill sets, experience and training, licensure/certifications, and equity.
