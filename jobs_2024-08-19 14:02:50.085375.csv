The role is for an Account Manager - Our dedicated Account Managers focus on one client until they prove they can handle more. They are responsible for working with clients and customers directly, answering questions, upselling customers and adding new prospects to our client pool. They learn new products and training materials to better tailor to our clients based on their specific situations.

Our Account Managers have good to great people skills, communication skills, team values and show compassion to people. Characteristics that align with our other team members include: strong work ethic, core values, business acumen, dedication and a sports oriented mindset.

We look for people that have a 4 year degree as our clients expect a certain caliber of people to be working with them, 1-2 years of business, communications or sales experience (or a similar field), prior internships can be used as relevant work experience, time management, tech savvy and most importantly a “low-key” attitude.

We have found that our Account Managers like to be challenged and we find that learning and developing new skills can be a challenge in and of itself. So we look for someone that is comfortable with change and rejection and positive criticism.

We offer paid training, benefits and lucrative and aggressive compensation plans to the right person. Merit and a proven track record speak volumes and we like to reward based on someone’s work ethic rather than just what a piece of paper has to say.
