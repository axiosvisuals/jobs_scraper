Our hours of operation are 7AM-7PM, seven days a week, including weekends. We pay $25 per hour on weekdays and $30 per hour on weekends, and we pay on the books. Additionally, there is an opportunity to pick-up regular weekend hours. **We do not hire weekend-only walkers; weekend work is given ONLY to walkers who work during the week Monday through Friday.**

A little about us... Canine Cardio Inc., was established in 2005 on the Upper East Side. We walk no more than 3 dogs at a time, and we arrange for all of our walkers to get their certification in Pet First Aid. We are searching for an employee, not an independent contractor, and we would like to find someone who will be a valuable addition to our team long-term. We hold annual team meetings, annual company dinners, and we put a lot of effort into establishing a strong team.

If you are interested in this position, please send us both a **cover letter** and **work resume**. **In the subject line of your email please include your daily window of availability This must be a consistant window each day (i.e. 7am-9am & 11am-2:30 pm).** Although dog-related experience is a plus it is not a necessity; you will receive thorough training in dog behavior, and this is largely a customer service role. Thanks very much, and we look forward to hearing from you!

Kind regards,

Jennifer
