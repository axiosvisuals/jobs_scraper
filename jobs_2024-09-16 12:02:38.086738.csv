Maddox, LLC","Norwalk, CT, US","fulltime","2024-09-16","direct_data","yearly",40000.0,50000.0,"USD",False,"","","","","","This is a long ad. We want applicants to be informed, have a good sense of what we stand for, and what this position requires. We want you to understand the exceptional kind of person we need for this role and be confident that you match what describe before you apply. If you’re the right candidate, we also want you to read this ad to the very end so that you know exactly what you must do to apply.

We are a growing law firm with a main office in Norwalk, Connecticut

We primarily handle criminal defense and serious injury cases. The owner of the firm has been practicing for thirty-three years and the Managing Attorney has been practicing for 30 years.

What does our exceptional administrative legal assistant do?

Our administrative legal assistant, (E.L.A.), is an integral member of our firm who is responsible for ensuring that our clients receive the best, most professional and caring treatment possible. Our E.L.A. is an essential team member who supports attorneys by providing accurate information and documents so that our Firm can fulfill its promise to deliver unequaled advocacy.

What are some characteristics that an E.L.A. should have?

You should be a voracious learner. You should have high energy and be almost irrepressibly positive. If you see the glass as being half full instead of half empty, you are the type of person we are looking for. People who work for this firm come to work believing that they have the rare ability and opportunity every day to help our clients, improve the lives of others and improve their own lives.

You will thrive with us if you not only want to learn the highest standards of legal practice and client service but you come to us with your own very high standards of commitment, drive, ethics and desire to serve others.

We would prefer if you read, speak and write fluently in Spanish.

Education is important to us, but knowledge, intellect, a broad history of reading and academic-equivalent background are also important.

You must be proficient in the use of WordPerfect, Excel, Microsoft Office, and Outlook.

You aren't afraid of technology.

You must be able to think on your feet and make smart decisions. You are well-spoken and you are an effective writer. You must also be able to proofread your own work.

You are focused and can block out distractions. You are passionate about details, quality of work and service, and doing things correctly.

You welcome constructive criticism. You are a natural student and are intellectually curious.

Some of our clients can be challenging, but that only means that as professionals we must meet that challenge. If you do not think that you are up to the challenge of being consistently compassionate and kind to people who are troubled by problems and issues and come to us for help, then this is not the job for you.

You also need to be detail oriented and willing to go the extra mile to get the job done right the first time. In our practice, getting it done right the first time for our clients is very important.

You will be working with others continuously. Both you and our other team members are accountable to each other. We are strong believers in the team approach and our office is a team environment, so if are not the type of person who roots for, helps, and applauds your co-workers, this is not the job for you.

You need to be able to talk to people in a manner that is polite, educated, and puts them at ease.

Kindness, courtesy, and patience toward clients and team members are always essential.

You need to be able communicate respectfully with people from all walks of life.

You MUST be able to handle working with several different databases of information. You must also be prepared to step into other team members' positions sometimes when they need support; this may include answering phones and greeting visitors to the office if support is needed in those areas.

At times, you will also need to know how to figure things out on your own and be able to creatively solve problems. At this Firm, we help each other regardless of the task or if we think the task is outside of our job description. You must understand that everything that we do and how we do everything is extremely important.

You will learn your job and other peoples’ jobs in the Firm so that you can anticipate other team members’ needs, next steps and how everything connects in order to deliver superlative service to our clients. You will be a student and at a later time, you will become a teacher. We are all teachers at this Firm and there will be consistent, ongoing training.

Our office is open Monday - Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00p.m. You are expected to be here during those hours, except for 1 hour for lunch.

Regarding evenings and weekends, normally you have those off but if we have an emergency or are preparing for a complex trial, we will expect you to help us out.

We want you to earn what we pay you. We don’t want to pay you to socialize, surf the internet, e-mail friends, family, or engage in any other non-work-related activities while you are in the office.

To put it simply, we expect you to give us 100% when you are at work.

If you are hired, you will be part of an exceptional team of people, all of whom work hard to get the job done right the first time and take pride in the work that they do. We are inspired. We inspire others. We set the standard for advocacy. You will be part of a team that is rewarded for their hard work. You will be a model of diligence, problem-solving and encouragement to others

The starting salary range for an Administrative Legal Assistant will depend upon experience.

A few words about experience. Prior experience in a law firm means very little if it is not accompanied by strength of character, drive, intelligence, kindness, optimism, and desire. We would rather start with someone with all the raw ingredients – work ethic, keen intelligence, education, kindness, desire, drive and strength of character and teach them what they need to know, than hire someone with experience who just wants to “punch in” when they come to work and then “punch out” at the end of the day.

Is this going to be an easy job? No. It might be the biggest challenge of your life. But it is our belief that anything great is worth working hard for and that our greatest growth comes from our biggest challenges. Prior team members who held this position and succeeded have been promoted to higher positions in our Firm; two have become practicing attorneys.

Please be careful before you apply for this position. Be sure that you truly match many if not all the characteristics that we’ve described for this role, and that you have objective justifications to assert that you meet the requirements and demands of this role.

If you have gotten this far and want to apply, it means that you are a smart, creative, energetic, hard worker, ready for a challenge and you want to be part of a team where your hard work and efforts are recognized, appreciated and rewarded. It also means that we really want to meet you.

Families come in all shapes and sizes. And that includes the Wendy’s family - the people you work with as a Wendy’s Shift Leader.  


The stuff you want - like fun people, quality food, and a paycheck - done. Our founder Dave Thomas had three rules for everyone who works here: Do the right thing. Treat people with respect. Make food better than they’d expect from a fast food place. No doubt you do the first two already. We can teach you the third!  


Sound good? Keep reading.  


**Making things happen is just one of your talents:**  

* If a Wendy’s restaurant was a person, it’d be you: fun, fast, friendly and never out of bacon.
  
* Whatever comes up with a customer - good or bad - you handle it like a boss (‘cuz you wanna be a boss someday soon).
  
* You get how things work here, and make sure new team members know it, too.
  
* You make sure food safety standards and procedures are on point.

  

**What you bring to the table:**  

* At least one year of restaurant work experience.
  
* High school diploma or GED. (Some college or military experience? Tell us that, too.)
  
* You’ve already led, managed and organized a team in a fast-paced environment.
  
* Mad skills in problem solving, customer service and decision making.
  
* Giving and taking direction like a pro.
  
* Flexible work availability.

  

**You must be willing and able to:**  

* Travel to other Wendy’s locations (restaurants, area office, etc.) as needed.
  
* Stand and move for most - if not all - of your shift.
  
* Lift up to 25-50 lbs. now and then.
  
* Handle weather-related moments like rain at the drive-thru, taking trash out in the summer, etc.
  
* Wear a headset, use other restaurant equipment such as a register or grill, and follow brand standards and guidelines.
