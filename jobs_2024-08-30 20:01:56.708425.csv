INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED, MULTI AWARD-WINNING PET CARE

At K9 Resorts Luxury Pet Hotel, we strive to provide the best pet care experience for your dog. We would like to take this time to thank you for your interest in our premier pet resort. Our love for animals can be traced back to 1999, when our Founders and CEOs, Steven and Jason Parker, were just 14 and 12 years of age. Steven and Jason started their own pet sitting business called K-9 Guardians Professional Pet Sitting because they loved dogs, and the thought of earning a few extra bucks at such a young age was exciting to them. Later on, the young entrepreneurs realized they wanted to make pet care their careers and, in 2005, K9 Resorts Luxury Pet Hotel was born in Fanwood, NJ.

**We’re proud to be internationally recognized and trusted for a variety of reasons, some of which include our:**

* Flawless customer service
* Cage free luxury boarding
* Loving and caring staff

Our state of the art facilities have been consistently rated within the top three in the nation and provide world class accommodations and care to our guests.

Inspired by the simplicity of Neapolitan cuisine, Olio é Piu and Chef Dominick Pepe bring Italian tradition to the vibrant intersection where Sixth and Greenwich avenues meet Christopher Street. First opened in the summer of 2010, the 74-seat restaurant fronted with a 45-seat open patio surrounded by flowers and greenery, overlooking the magnificent Jefferson Market Library. Olio é Piu offers a true sense of Mediterranean liveliness in the heart of Greenwich Village.  

  

As an authentic trattoria, its cuisine is based on classic Italian dishes, with a focus on house-made pasta, hand-stretched pizza, and entrees like Branzino and Vitello Alla Milanese. The open dining area, traditional wood-fired oven, rustic interior, thin-crust Neapolitan-style pizza, and carefully selected wine and cocktail list bring a piece of old-world Italy to a renowned corner in the Village.
