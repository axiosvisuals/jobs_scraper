**Come join our Holisticare Hospice Volunteer Team! Are you caring and compassionate? Do you have a passion for helping others? Then we would love to have you as a hospice volunteer!**  

Holisticare Hospice'svolunteers are provided the preparation and training they need to comfortably and successfully complete their chosen assignments. Some volunteers receive additional training based on their selected area of service. Holisticare Hospice has multiple office locations where we serve patients located in part of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Our primary area of coverage includes offices we have located in Berwyn, PA and Toms River, NJ. In Pennsylvania, we serve the five counties in and around Philadelphia including: Bucks, Montgomery, Chester, Delaware and Philadelphia. In New Jersey, we serve patients in Atlantic, Monmouth, Middlesex, and Ocean counties. **Become a hero on your own terms**  

On your own time. In your own way. With your personality. Your ability to relate. Your own skills. Your way of solving a problem, sharing a story, helping somebody remember important moments in their lives. **You can be one of our volunteers**  

When you give us the precious gift of your time and interest, we give you a chance to make a real difference in someone’s life. We train you, find you the right assignment and stand behind you as you grow.  

Holisticare Hospice provides professional care with a personal touch. We accomplish this by focusing on both the patient and their family. We will treat the disease process with medical expertise while emphasizing quality living, not only physically, but also psychosocially, emotionally and spiritually. Comfort, compassion and calming presence are the gifts we bring to this service, and we are honored to walk with the patient and loved ones through this special time.  

VOLUNTEERS ARE NOT PAID EMPLOYEES AND DO NOT RECEIVE COMPENSATION FOR THEIR TIME.
Responsibilities:
**Patient Care Volunteers** are part of a patient’s care team. They make home visits to offer companionship for patients and relief for caregivers. Examples of patient care volunteer opportunities include reading to the patient, assisting with a hobby, listening, running errands, or grocery shopping. **Organizational Volunteers** do not work directly with patients and families. Examples of organizational volunteer opportunities include working in our offices to support our care team or help patients and families through indirect support, such as assisting with our Transitions program, creating special memories for holidays, patient birthdays and anniversaries, planting flowers or mowing a yard for a patient that is unable to continue doing so, and helping with other needs of our patients and families. **Musician Volunteers** are professional musicians, choir members, music students and teachers, board-certified music therapists, band members, and more, to share music and brighten up the days of all those we serve. As a Music Volunteer you will be able to provide a beautiful presence through the comfort of your music to our patients, and provide peace to our front-line healthcare staff. **Pet Therapy Volunteers** are a wonderful way to share comfort and compassion through interactions with Certified Therapy Pets and Hospice Patients. A visit from a therapy animal can bring an immense amount of joy, emotional support, and fulfillment to a hospice patient and their family members. Pet therapy has been proven to decrease pain and stress. No hospice experience necessary but the animal must be certified and up to date on all vaccinations. **Veteran Volunteers** have the unique ability to relate and connect with other Veterans, which is why they are vital to ensuring our veteran patients get the extra attention they deserve. Veteran volunteers provide companionship (conversation/sharing stories, playing games, etc.), caregiver relief (to give direct caregivers a break), compassionate listening, and participation in Veteran pinning ceremonies. Veteran volunteers have invaluable insight and may be able to give stress reduction techniques to patients/caregivers, help recognize PTSD in patients, and help patients/caregivers identify and process grief.
Qualifications:
* Understanding and supportive of hospice philosophy.
* Compassionate person who is accepting and respectful of people's differences.
* Must be able to pass background check requirements.

 ***BIG plans are on the horizon for Margaritas. Our team and restaurants are great today, but our future is even better. There is no better time than now to join the Margaritas Family!***

 **Great Food**

*You can be proud of the food you serve.* The tremendous variety of Mexican Food makes us the perfect destination for Mexican Food lovers. Our annual Ultimate Events like Cinco, National Margaritas day... etc are more widely known than practically any other restaurant.

  

Our love for doing what we do started in 1985 with our first restaurant, Tio Juans, in Concord, NH. The first Margaritas Mexican Restaurant followed soon thereafter in Orono, Maine with our first partner Stan Bagley. A few months later, my 21-year-old brother Dave Pelletier partnered up with us and, with help from many people, started opening more locations in Maine and New Hampshire. With the president and CEO lining up new locations and Dave concentrating on operations and our guests, things began to heat up and really take shape. Our Margaritas family grew every year, with amazing people having a lot of fun making fajitas, tacos, and shaking Margaritas. We knew if our restaurants were going to be special, we needed more Mexico in the recipe than anyone else.

 **Great People**

 *You will work at a destination for celebration.* Our restaurants have a rich history of hosting birthdays, anniversaries, receptions, reunions, and other important memorable occasions.

 *You are part of an amazing family.* Our restaurants are a place where you can both make friends and find a mentor. Its important that our family of team members flourish, learn and


grow.  



  

*You give back to the community. We host and donate fund raisers for our community where we donate up to 20% of the net proceeds of the sales on the day of the event to the charity to help their causes.*

  

From the 90s to today, we organized trips to central Mexico for managers and staff to immerse themselves in the food and culture that we love so much. At Margaritas, its always been about the love and having fun. We are proud of our teams, past and present, and the thousands of you that helped and supported us along the way.

  

Todays Margaritas is a summation of all we have learned so far. We look forward to many more decades of icy Margaritas, delicious Mexican food, and good times while making memories with all of you.
