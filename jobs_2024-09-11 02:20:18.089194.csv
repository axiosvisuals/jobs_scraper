NATIONWIDE SEARCH!","The Nanny League, Inc.","Montclair, NJ, US","fulltime","2024-09-10","direct_data","yearly",61803.0,78256.0,"USD",False,"","","","","","Overview: **NATIONWIDE SEARCH: MONTCLAIR, NJ**  

A charming and close-knit family in Montclair, NJ, is on the lookout for a sophisticated, highly organized full-time, live-in nanny and household manager to join their bustling household. With four lovely daughters, ages almost 7, almost 5, 2.5 years, and 7 months, this family thrives on warmth, teamwork, and the kind of nurturing care that fosters growth and joy in everyday life. They are searching for someone who can effortlessly blend into their family’s routine, providing both childcare and household management support.  

This hybrid role is designed to be flexible, with the nanny working on weekends—Saturday and Sunday—and enjoying two days off during the week. The family envisions their ideal candidate as a trusted partner for the mother, helping her with everything from getting the girls ready for school in the mornings to overseeing dinner and bedtime in the evenings. The schedule is fluid, with early mornings (6:30am start time) and late afternoons dedicated to the children, while weekends are full days. While the parents are around on weekends, they like to have another hand to help with the kids and household given the kids are all home at this time. Flexibility is key, as the family is seeking around 50 to 55 hours of support per week, which includes overtime.  

The parents hope to find someone who feels comfortable juggling the dynamics of a home with multiple young children. Their oldest daughter, who is now in first grade, has a full schedule from 8:10 a.m. to 5 p.m., with potential after-school activities requiring earlier pick up times from aftercare. The younger three girls attend full-time daycare from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., and while the days are structured, the family is keen to find a nanny who can help with simple homework assignments and step in when the household gets busy. Experience with multiple young children is a plus.  

Communication is important to this family. They are committed to staying flexible and open when it comes to scheduling, ensuring that their nanny’s personal time and needs are respected. The mother, who works from home, is looking for a capable, proactive “A-team” player to be her right hand. From running a tidy household to assisting with cooking family meals, this role calls for someone who can keep things running smoothly. While the father enjoys cooking, his busy work schedule means that someone who is confident in preparing healthy, nutritious meals for the family would be ideal. The family’s goal is to find a long-term nanny who will become an integral part of their household for years to come.  

Their daughters are all unique, each with her own bright and dynamic personality. The oldest is a thoughtful child who, while dealing with anxiety, benefits from the care of someone who can guide her with kindness and consistency. Transitions can be challenging for her, so a patient, firm presence is important. Their second daughter, currently in speech therapy, is sweet and affectionate, always ready for a hug. The third daughter, who receives early intervention services, is a happy and playful child with a spirited personality, while the baby will need more attention as she grows.
In this role, the family is seeking someone who will not only care for the children but also manage various household duties. This includes family laundry, light cleaning, organizing shared spaces, and keeping up with the day-to-day tasks between visits from the regular housekeeper. The family’s French Bulldog is also a part of their lives, so the nanny should feel comfortable with light pet care.
The family’s home is located in a vibrant, walkable neighborhood with easy access to the train into New York City. With parks, restaurants, coffee shops, and cultural activities like art classes and music events nearby, the area offers plenty of stimulation for both the nanny and children.  

In addition to offering a competitive salary based on experience, the family provides paid sick time, vacation, and holidays, along with mileage reimbursement if the nanny uses their own vehicle. While all vaccines are required, a COVID booster is not a necessity. The family hopes to find their ideal candidate as soon as possible, with a start date that’s just around the corner. This is more than just a job; it’s an opportunity to become a valued member of a loving, respectful, and open-hearted family. If you’re someone who thrives in a dynamic environment, loves working with children, and enjoys taking on the challenges of household management, this could be the perfect fit for you!

To this end, in partnership with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (Health Department), FPHNYC incubates innovative public health initiatives implemented by DOHMH to advance community health throughout the city. It facilitates partnerships, often new and unconventional, between government and the private sector to develop, test, and launch new initiatives. These collaborations speed the execution of demonstration projects, effect expansion of successful pilot programs, and support rapid implementation to meet the public health needs of individuals, families, and communities across New York City (NYC).
  
  

PROGRAM OVERVIEW
  
With an annual budget of $1.6 billion and more than 6,000 employees throughout the five boroughs, the NYC Health Department is one of the largest public health agencies in the world, serving 8 million New Yorkers from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds. We're tackling a broad range of public health issues with innovative policies and programs and getting exceptional results, but our work is never finished. The breadth of our innovative programs provides the widest range of choices for every member of our team.
  
This role sits in the Bureau of Chronic Disease Prevention in the Center for Health Equity & Community Wellness (CHECW). Seeking to eliminate racial and other inequities resulting in premature mortality and with an unwavering grounding in history and structural analysis, CHECW works to increase visibility of the harm perpetuated by centuries of racist, socially unjust policy while pushing towards redress for the most impacted NYC communities. CHECW addresses inequity across community and healthcare systems in partnership with community, faith-based, and health care organizations. CHECW’s work focuses on social determinants of health, including environmental and commercial determinants, and addresses both upstream and downstream factors to improve health and well-being of New Yorkers. CHECW is a division of the NYC Health Department.
  
  

The Bureau of Chronic Disease Prevention (BCDP) strives to reduce the burden of chronic disease, including heart disease, obesity, and cancer, among New Yorkers. We work to address the impact of structural racism and other injustices that are a root cause of the inequitable prevalence, treatment and outcomes of chronic diseases in communities of color and among other marginalized communities. BCDP focuses on nutrition, tobacco use, the built environment, screening for cancer, and reducing the incidence and impact of hypertension. BCDP works with partners in government and the community to employ evidence-based policies, programs, communications and research aimed at shifting environments, changing systems and promoting health equity. The Bureau sits within the Center for Health Equity and Community Wellness.
  
  

The Public Health Detailing Program sits within the BCDP at the NYC Health Department. The program works with primary care providers, dentists, pharmacists and other clinical and community members to improve patient care relating to key public health challenges. Health Department representatives promote clinical preventive services and chronic disease management through the delivery of brief, targeted messages to health care providers, community stakeholders and staff at their practice sites. Detailing “Action Kits” – containing clinical tools, provider resources and patient education materials to promote evidence–based best practices – are distributed during visits.
  
Modeled after the pharmaceutical sales approach, the Public Health Detailing Program builds on the Health Department’s extensive experience in medical provider education, health care quality improvement and community-based health promotion. Public Health Detailing is organized around specific clinical topics, chosen largely because of their anticipated impact on morbidity and mortality. Previous campaigns include Diabetes, Hypertension, Obesity, and Breastfeeding.
