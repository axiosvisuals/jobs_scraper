For some, traveling is fun and sometimes for business; however, many travelers miss being home. Our Housekeeping team makes our hotels feel like home. As a Room Attendant, you help create guest experiences that are enjoyable and comfortable.



As a Room Attendant, you’ll be doing a lot of things around here (boredom won’t be an issue). Here are a few of the tasks that will keep you busy on a daily basis:


* Clean, dust, polish and vacuum to make sure guest rooms and bathrooms meet hotel standards.
* Change linens, make beds, and leave the bathroom sparkling.
* Restock all guest room supplies, like soap, shampoo, and coffee.
* Organize your linen closet, restock your cart, and get ready for the next day, before your shift ends each day.
* Greet guests that you encounter during your shift with a friendly smile.


**Where You’ve Been:**



We’re looking for someone with at least one month of related experience. But most importantly you must have a passion for customer service and be able to work with others seamlessly. This means you have no problem collaborating within a diverse team dynamic and working calmly under pressure. This job is high energy and anything but dull!



**When You’re Here:**



This is not a job where you sit behind a desk. Be prepared to move around because more than half of the time you will be standing/sitting, carrying/lifting up to 50 pounds, walking, bending/twisting, climbing stairs and more. You also must be able to accommodate varying schedules including nights, weekends and holidays. But wait, there’s a great upside: in exchange for your flexibility, we offer excellent pay, hotel discounts, and the opportunity to be part of an anything-but-standard growing hotel company.

StaffCo is a Professional Employer Organization, commonly referred to as a PEO, duly organized and registered under the New York Professional Employer Organization law. StaffCo and SUNY have entered into a professional employer agreement under which StaffCo is the employer of Stony Brook Clinical Practice Management Plan employees and responsible for all aspects of employment, including hirings, promotions, disciplines, terminations, the day-to-day direction and supervision of work, as well as labor relations and collective bargaining. StaffCo is fully responsible for providing all payroll and human resources services, including the payment of wages, collecting and reporting payroll taxes and maintaining any and all employee benefits.  SUNY Stony Brook Hospital is responsible for the operation of the hospital and provision of health care and is the co-employer as is necessary to conduct its responsibilities and for related licensure, regulatory or statutory requirements and obligations.

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/U--haul","http://www.uhaul.com/","2727 North Central Avenue

Rutgers Cancer Institute offers world-class cancer care, providing patients with the most advanced treatment options through an integrated cancer care network, including clinical trials, immunotherapy, precision medicine, complex surgical procedures, and sophisticated radiation therapy techniques. Rutgers Cancer Institute and Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, an RWJBarnabas Health facility, are one of only two programs in the state to offer blood and marrow transplantations and CAR T-cell therapy.

Rutgers Cancer Institute is a cornerstone of New Jersey’s premier academic health center, Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS).  

Construction is currently underway for a new $750 million state-of-the-art Cancer Center adjacent to the current Rutgers Cancer Institute facility and Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital. The 510,000 square foot Jack and Sheryl Morris Cancer Center will be the state’s first free-standing cancer hospital. It will feature outpatient and inpatient clinical space—including 84 infusion bays, 74 exam rooms, and 96 inpatient beds. This is in addition to state-of-the-art laboratories where critical scientific investigation will be amplified, enabling physician-scientists to translate findings directly to patients. The Jack and Sheryl Morris Cancer Center will also have the capacity to offer wellness and education resources all in one location.

Rutgers Cancer Institute is home to nearly 250 internationally recognized physicians and researchers. The long-standing relationship with their NCI Research Consortium Partner Princeton University was recently leveraged to establish the Ludwig Cancer Research Princeton Branch with several faculty as founding members and leaders of the Branch. Their work on cancer metabolism, not only through the new Ludwig Branch but also through the Duncan and Nancy MacMillan Cancer Immunology and Metabolism Center of Excellence at Rutgers Cancer Institute, will accelerate and translate laboratory discoveries into clinical treatments through more effective and efficiently designed clinical trials.  

  

The Rutgers Cancer Institute’s Duncan and Nancy MacMillan Cancer Immunology and Metabolism Center of Excellence is an institute at the intersection of oncologic immunology and metabolism that seeks to increase research that leads to new therapies for patients; develop cutting-edge facilities to test new interventions; and facilitate commercial and university collaborations. This includes discovery and production of novel cell therapy constructs via an institutional good manufactory practices (GMP) facility.
