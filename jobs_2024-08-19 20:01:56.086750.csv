**CORE RESPONSIBILITIES:**

* Welcome and greet guests

* Respond promptly and tactfully to any guest issues, always providing excellent service to maintain guest satisfaction
* Take, cancel and change room reservations, including in concert with pricing and promotional guidelines in a dynamic pricing environment

**Be a part of a resilient, thriving community!**

Since its founding in 1825, **B’nai Jeshurun (BJ)** has been at the forefront of the American Jewish experience. As it approaches its third century, its vision remains focused on the spiritual work of transformation and on the creation of a Jewish path that is authentic, profound, and helps all members of the community seek and live their purpose to the fullest.

BJ’s spiritual leaders and its nearly 1,900 member families and 60+ staff share a vision of a diverse, dynamic, and inclusive community that offers many paths to Jewish religious life, while supporting one another in their spiritual quests. BJ is committed to honoring tradition while re-imagining and innovating its practices and programs to create a vibrant, contemporary, and relevant Jewish life for all who are seeking it.

Rabbis Rolando Matalon and Felicia Sol, both of whom have artfully led BJ for three and two decades respectively, continue to evolve along with the community they serve; including COVID-19 and the need for virtual access that resulted in an expansion of our reach.

**History**

Williamsburg Charter High School (WCHS) is a high-performing, public charter high school located in Brooklyn, New York. WCHS opened in August 2004 as the first Chancellor-authorized charter high school in the City of New York with a ninth-grade class of 131 students. Now in its eighth year of operation, WCHS has grown to serve approximately 944 students in grades nine through twelve. The school’s mission is to unite youth, families, staff, teachers, and the community at large in providing young people with the tools necessary to make sense of the world and prepare them in their journey to become skilled workers and literate citizens of the world. Young people will accomplish this through their participation in a rigorous and demanding liberal arts education that includes language, literature, writing, science, history, mathematics, the arts, technology, and exploration in disciplines designed to teach fairness, justice, respect, and compassion for themselves and others, as well as the skills of critical thinking, communication and research.

Williamsburg Charter High School provides a broad liberal arts academic program to the high-school-age youth of north Brooklyn. School programs are individualized to connect to each student’s particular level of development, including English Language Learners and students with Special Education Services. Further, WCHS provides supportive relationships with faculty, extended instructional periods, and opportunities after-school and on Saturdays for additional academic support. Social and emotional support is also available to students to ensure their non-academic needs are addressed. Students are accepted to WCHS through a random lottery with no minimum requirements, tests, or auditions required to gain entrance, and, as a public charter school, there is no tuition.

The Williamsburg Charter High Schools seeks individuals who:

* Are committed to providing students with a highly rigorous academic experience.
* Enjoy working in a highly collaborative, professional setting as well as independently.
* Are sensitive to the unique needs of the community they serve as well as the complex issues that are present for urban youth and their families.

* Are passionate and positive about school culture.
* Take full responsibility for students’ achievement.
* Act as professional role models for students.
* Are reflective and willing to improve upon their practice through professional development and support.
* Manage time, resources, and technology effectively to ensure that they can complete all required responsibilities.
* Use objective data as well as anecdotal information to gauge student performance.
* See their work as a career and a lifestyle, not just as a job. They should be willing to take time before and after school to complete their responsibilities such as lesson planning, supporting struggling students, and grading student work.
* Believe deeply in the transformative power of education for all students, families, and educators.

Duties for Academic Guidance Counselors

**Three-piece suits. Cold calls in a cubicle. Lone wolves.****Nope. Not here.**  
At Terminix Nation, we view sales as the natural result of building strong relationships and solving customers’ problems. If you’re nodding your head right now, we’d love to meet you.  
Our sales team is the engine that keeps Terminix running. And we reward the team accordingly with a competitive salary and benefits — including medical, dental, vision, a 401(k) with company match, and more. There are also opportunities to get trained, gain new skills, and build an awesome career.

But first things first. When you start in sales at Terminix Nation, you’ll get down and dirty. You’ll learn how to inspect and identify infestations (or conditions conducive to infestations) of all kinds of organisms, insects, birds, or other pests. Sounds awesome, right? You’ll learn all about what we do and how you can make your clients’ homes safer and their lives better. Once you know that, you’ll turn your talents to proposals and presentations that result in sales.

**As a Residential Sales Professional, here’s what you can expect** 

* You won’t be tied to a desk. You’ll be out and about — mobile, independent, and growing your career on your own terms. You’ll be the face of Terminix to your local community (with the backing of a national brand), and your clients will count on you to protect their homes and their families.
* When you first join Terminix Nation, you’ll spend a few months in training. Once you’ve got that and some state required licenses and certificates under your belt, you’ll take the lead with your own customers.
* You’ll get rewarded with competitive pay and robust benefits to cover you and your family. As a teammate, you will be eligible for a 401(k) with company match, company-paid life insurance, tuition reimbursement, and a generous student loan repayment program. You put in the work, and you’ll reap the rewards.
* You’ll be part of a community – bonus points if you’re already a leader in yours. Our bonds are strong at Terminix Nation and the relationships we develop in the communities we serve are unparalleled. Our teammates give back through volunteering, donations, scholarships, and more.
* You’ll be onboarded and trained by the best of ’em. You’ll get paid to get licensed, something you’ll have for a lifetime. You’ll know how to bust bugs at home, too.

**What your days will look like**

* Hit the books with training modules and hit the streets with on-the-job training with your teammates. You’ll learn product knowledge and sales techniques for selling the full suite of Terminix products. We’ll train and support you through state licensing and other company requirements.
* You’ll inspect and assess pest problems with precision and suggest Terminix solutions following company policy and pricing instructions.
* You must be obsessed with the customer’s experience — delivering exceptional service, following up to ensure satisfaction, and thinking creatively about how to grow the relationship. And if an account is delinquent, you’ll need to handle that with grace and effectiveness, too.
* Of course, you’ve got to like to sell solutions to problems. You will be expected to meet and greet potential customers to generate new business for the branch.
* There’s an opportunity to grow into a role you’re passionate about and fits your skillset — whether that’s management or another opportunity at Terminix.

**Some non-negotiables**  
There are some things you’ll just need to have or know to join Terminix Nation as a Residential Sales Professional.

* A high school education or GED.
* A valid driver’s license from your current state of residence.
* Strong social, customer service, and communication skills — in fact, we’d be really impressed if you came to this role with related experience and/or training in sales.
* Some basic math skills — add, subtract, multiply, and divide in all units of measure, using whole numbers, common fractions, and decimals. You’ll need to be able to follow instructions for mixing on product labels.

**Straight talk about the physical demands of our work**

We’re not going to sugarcoat it. The essential functions of this job have some physical demands (of course, reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the essential functions.) Here’s what we mean:

* You’ve got to be able to move up to 10 lbs. regularly and 11–20 lbs. frequently, whether that’s lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, or otherwise repositioning objects.
* You’ll move around a lot — regularly sitting, climbing, balancing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, and crawling. You’ll go up and down stairs, ladders, scaffolding, ramps, and poles. And you’ll need to keep your balance when walking, standing, or crouching on narrow, slippery, or moving surfaces. (You’ll definitely get your steps in.)
* You must be able to safely operate a motor vehicle and make sure it and all other equipment is kept clean.
* The vision to perform detail-oriented activities at distances close to the eyes or within arm’s reach.
* Sometimes you’ll need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE), like an OSHA-compliant respirator, and you’ll need to be okay with regularly working in confined spaces, narrow aisles, or passageways (you know, where critters live).

This position offers a base pay plus commission.

· $75k average compensation (base + commission) during first 12 months  
· $15.50 - $22.00 during training

Actual annual potential is based on individual performance and our top Sales Professionals earn well over $100k annually.

Brands like e.l.f., Netflix, Dove, Red Bull, and Tinder rely on Movers+Shakers to win on social and beyond. We've gotten our clients over 250 billion views on social - from major brand moments to viral daily content.



The hype doesn't stop with our clients' brands. Fast Company named Movers+Shakers one of the ""Most Innovative Companies"" in the world, and AdAge named us a ""Small Agency of the Year"" (three years in a row). Adweek called us, ""the best agency in the world at creating campaigns on TikTok.""



We're really proud of our work, and we're even more proud of our culture. In their first week, new employees inevitably comment on how positive and supportive our workplace is. A month in, they're noting how little ego there is, and how departments collaborate surprisingly deeply. We only work with brands that share our commitment to spreading joy, and we have parted ways with client teams that don't treat our team with respect.

**THE ROLE**



The ideal candidate is obsessed with hands-on content creation and has a passion for innovation and new digital & social platforms. You have a background in creating TikToks, strong editing skills, along with a deep understanding of production must-haves. You will also bring a knack for ideation, strategic know-how, and a collaborative mindset.



This role requires someone who is organized, creative, and energized by making great work, whether that be concepting in partnership with the broader team, or picking up a phone and shooting/editing a piece of content themselves.



This means making sure the production of that content is planned out, scheduled, and executed correctly (often by YOU!), and also that props and sets are considered. You will also have the opportunity to brief in and work with in-house editors on some projects.

  


**RESPONSIBILITIES**


* Ideate & execute the creation of platform-native social content that's on strategy & responsive to trends and consumer-focused ideation.
* Work independently and partnered with the creative team, content creators, influencers, and production partners in the development and execution of brand content.
* Work cross-functionally with account management, project management, strategy and creative teams.
* Regularly contribute to creative and strategic brainstorms to develop and create seamlessly executable, quick-turn content within timeline and budget parameters.
* Develop and write creative briefs for content creators and influencers.
* Contribute to the development and implementation of creative workflows, systems, and processes to improve creative output and operational efficiency
* Work simultaneously on multiple clients' programs within tight deadlines, seeing projects through from start to finish.

  


**QUALIFICATIONS**


* **Living in the NY or LA area**
* Proficiency in Adobe Creative Suite programs: Photoshop, Premiere, After Effects, Adobe Express, Illustrator, InDesign, Lightroom, and more.
* 3-5 years of content creation experience in a marketing setting
* Deep experience in design, editing and/or production
* Experience concepting and creating brand content across owned social channels
* Experience creating original and remixed content
* Comfortability working with in-app tools to create original content — e.g., filters, sounds, visual effects, etc.
* Master of in-app editing across platforms, including TikTok, CapCut, Reels, and beyond.
* Proficiency in hands-on content creation, handling production and creative execution
* Ability to ideate & concept original ideas both independently and in collaboration with team members.
* Extensive experience concepting and executing original content across TikTok, Instagram (Reels, Stories, Feed), YouTube (including Shorts), and other emerging platforms.
* Ability to thrive in a fast-paced, deadline-driven environment
* Strong attention to detail and commitment to quality
* Passion for delighting clients and going above & beyond
* Keen eye for detail with the foresight to think about the bigger picture
* Super organized, able to manage a ton of things simultaneously and follow tight deadlines


We look forward to hearing from you!

  


**BASE SALARY RANGE**


**Our estimated range for this role is $65,000-95,000\\***


* Don't let this range drive your decision to apply. Actual compensation packages are based on the level of skill and experience each candidate brings to their role. Similarly, there might also be a more senior or junior position available, that would be a better fit with your expertise. For example, a person may apply for a Senior Creative Producer role, and we may assess that their skills are at the Creative Producer level. Each level has its own compensation range.



At Movers+Shakers, we pride ourselves on competitive salaries, and we work hard to ensure there is pay equity across the company.

We are proud to be a member of the Rentokil family of companies, the global leader in Pest Control and other services across more than 90 countries. We pride ourselves on being a trusted partner to many of the world's leading brands and serve consumer and business customers across multiple industries. We are extremely proud of our legacy of excellence and constantly work to fulfill our mission to ""protect people, enhance lives, and preserve the planet.""

**Three-piece suits. Cold calls in a cubicle. Lone wolves.****Nope. Not here.**  
At Terminix Nation, we view sales as the natural result of building strong relationships and solving customers’ problems. If you’re nodding your head right now, we’d love to meet you.  
Our sales team is the engine that keeps Terminix running. And we reward the team accordingly with a competitive salary and benefits — including medical, dental, vision, a 401(k) with company match, and more. There are also opportunities to get trained, gain new skills, and build an awesome career.

But first things first. When you start in sales at Terminix Nation, you’ll get down and dirty. You’ll learn how to inspect and identify infestations (or conditions conducive to infestations) of all kinds of organisms, insects, birds, or other pests. Sounds awesome, right? You’ll learn all about what we do and how you can make your clients’ homes safer and their lives better. Once you know that, you’ll turn your talents to proposals and presentations that result in sales.

**As a Residential Sales Professional, here’s what you can expect** 

* You won’t be tied to a desk. You’ll be out and about — mobile, independent, and growing your career on your own terms. You’ll be the face of Terminix to your local community (with the backing of a national brand), and your clients will count on you to protect their homes and their families.
* When you first join Terminix Nation, you’ll spend a few months in training. Once you’ve got that and some state required licenses and certificates under your belt, you’ll take the lead with your own customers.
* You’ll get rewarded with competitive pay and robust benefits to cover you and your family. As a teammate, you will be eligible for a 401(k) with company match, company-paid life insurance, tuition reimbursement, and a generous student loan repayment program. You put in the work, and you’ll reap the rewards.
* You’ll be part of a community – bonus points if you’re already a leader in yours. Our bonds are strong at Terminix Nation and the relationships we develop in the communities we serve are unparalleled. Our teammates give back through volunteering, donations, scholarships, and more.
* You’ll be onboarded and trained by the best of ’em. You’ll get paid to get licensed, something you’ll have for a lifetime. You’ll know how to bust bugs at home, too.

**What your days will look like**

* Hit the books with training modules and hit the streets with on-the-job training with your teammates. You’ll learn product knowledge and sales techniques for selling the full suite of Terminix products. We’ll train and support you through state licensing and other company requirements.
* You’ll inspect and assess pest problems with precision and suggest Terminix solutions following company policy and pricing instructions.
* You must be obsessed with the customer’s experience — delivering exceptional service, following up to ensure satisfaction, and thinking creatively about how to grow the relationship. And if an account is delinquent, you’ll need to handle that with grace and effectiveness, too.
* Of course, you’ve got to like to sell solutions to problems. You will be expected to meet and greet potential customers to generate new business for the branch.
* There’s an opportunity to grow into a role you’re passionate about and fits your skillset — whether that’s management or another opportunity at Terminix.

**Some non-negotiables**  
There are some things you’ll just need to have or know to join Terminix Nation as a Residential Sales Professional.

* A high school education or GED.
* A valid driver’s license from your current state of residence.
* Strong social, customer service, and communication skills — in fact, we’d be really impressed if you came to this role with related experience and/or training in sales.
* Some basic math skills — add, subtract, multiply, and divide in all units of measure, using whole numbers, common fractions, and decimals. You’ll need to be able to follow instructions for mixing on product labels.

**Straight talk about the physical demands of our work**

We’re not going to sugarcoat it. The essential functions of this job have some physical demands (of course, reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the essential functions.) Here’s what we mean:

* You’ve got to be able to move up to 10 lbs. regularly and 11–20 lbs. frequently, whether that’s lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, or otherwise repositioning objects.
* You’ll move around a lot — regularly sitting, climbing, balancing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, and crawling. You’ll go up and down stairs, ladders, scaffolding, ramps, and poles. And you’ll need to keep your balance when walking, standing, or crouching on narrow, slippery, or moving surfaces. (You’ll definitely get your steps in.)
* You must be able to safely operate a motor vehicle and make sure it and all other equipment is kept clean.
* The vision to perform detail-oriented activities at distances close to the eyes or within arm’s reach.
* Sometimes you’ll need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE), like an OSHA-compliant respirator, and you’ll need to be okay with regularly working in confined spaces, narrow aisles, or passageways (you know, where critters live).

This position offers a base pay plus commission.

· $75k average compensation (base + commission) during first 12 months  
· $15.50 - $22.00 during training

Actual annual potential is based on individual performance and our top Sales Professionals earn well over $100k annually.

**Fast-talking, glad-handing, double-dealing slicksters.****Not our salespeople.**  
At Terminix Nation, our salespeople are relationship builders and problem solvers. They’re the engine that keeps Terminix running. And we reward them accordingly with a competitive salary and benefits including medical, dental, vision, a 401(k) with company match, and more. There are also opportunities to get trained, gain new skills, and build an awesome career.

But first things first. When you start in sales at Terminix Nation, you’ll get down and dirty. You’ll learn how to inspect and identify infestations (or potential infestations) of all kinds of organisms, insects, birds, and other pests. You’ll learn all about what we do and how you can make your clients’ properties safer and more secure. Once you’ve learned that, you’ll turn your talents to proposals and presentations that result in sales.

**As a Commercial Sales Professional, here’s what you can expect** 

* You won’t be tied to a desk. You’ll be out and about — mobile, independent, and growing your career with a clear view of next steps. You’ll be the face of Terminix to your local community (with the backing of a national brand), and your clients will count on you to protect their businesses and livelihoods.
* When you first join Terminix Nation, you’ll spend a few months in training. Once you’ve got that and some state required licenses and certificates under your belt, you’ll take the lead with your own customers.
* You’ll get rewarded with competitive pay and robust benefits to cover you and your family. As a teammate, you will be eligible for a 401(k) with company match, company-paid life insurance, tuition reimbursement, and a generous student loan repayment program. You put in the work, and you’ll reap the rewards.
* You’ll be part of a community — bonus points if you’re already a leader in yours. Our bonds are strong at Terminix Nation and the relationships we develop in the communities we serve are unparalleled. Our teammates give back through volunteering, donations, scholarships, and more.
* You’ll be onboarded and trained by the best of ’em. You’ll get paid to get licensed, something you’ll have for a lifetime. You’ll know how to bust bugs at home, too.

**What your days will look like**

* Hit the books with training modules and hit the streets with on-the-job training with your teammates. You’ll learn product knowledge and sales techniques for selling the full suite of Terminix products. We’ll train and support you through state licensing and other company requirements.
* You’ll inspect and assess pest problems with precision and suggest Terminix solutions following company policy and pricing instructions.
* You must be obsessed with the customer’s experience — delivering exceptional service, following up to ensure satisfaction, and thinking creatively about how to grow the relationship. You’ll have to be thoughtful about navigating the intricacies of commercial properties and management. And if an account is delinquent, you’ll need to handle that with grace and effectiveness, too.
* Of course, you’ve got to like to sell solutions to problems. You will be expected to meet and greet potential customers to generate new business for the branch.
* There’s an opportunity to grow into a role you’re passionate about and fits your skillset — whether that’s management or another opportunity at Terminix.

**Some non-negotiables**  
There are some things you’ll just need to have or know to join Terminix Nation as a Commercial Sales Professional.

* A high school education or GED.
* A valid driver’s license from your current state of residence.
* Strong customer service, communication, and critical thinking skills — in fact, we’d be really impressed if you came to this role with related experience and/or training in sales.
* Some basic math skills — add, subtract, multiply, and divide in all units of measure, using whole numbers, common fractions, and decimals. You’ll need to be able to follow instructions for mixing on product labels.

**Straight talk about the physical demands of our work**  
We’re not going to sugarcoat it. The essential functions of this job have some physical demands (of course, reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the essential functions.) Here’s what we mean:

* You’ve got to be able to move up to 10 lbs. regularly and 11–20 lbs. frequently, whether that’s lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, or otherwise repositioning objects.
* You’ll move around a lot — regularly sitting, climbing, balancing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, and crawling. You’ll go up and down stairs, ladders, scaffolding, ramps, and poles. And you’ll need to keep your balance when walking, standing, or crouching on narrow, slippery, or moving surfaces. (You’ll definitely get your steps in.)
* You must be able to safely operate a motor vehicle and make sure it and all other equipment is kept clean.
* The vision to perform detail-oriented activities at distances close to the eyes or within arm’s reach.
* Sometimes you’ll need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE), like an OSHA-compliant respirator, and you’ll need to be okay with regularly working in confined spaces, narrow aisles, or passageways (you know, where critters live).

**Why Choose Us?**

A career with the Rentokil family of companies can be a professional trajectory filled with opportunity. We pride ourselves on being a world-class team that rewards high performance, and we love to promote from within. We offer competitive pay and many of our roles offer performance incentives.

For more information about our benefits, see below!

We are proud to be a member of the Rentokil family of companies, the global leader in Pest Control and other services across more than 90 countries. We pride ourselves on being a trusted partner to many of the world's leading brands and serve consumer and business customers across multiple industries. We are extremely proud of our legacy of excellence and constantly work to fulfill our mission to ""protect people, enhance lives, and preserve the planet.""

**Three-piece suits. Cold calls in a cubicle. Lone wolves.****Nope. Not here.**  
At Terminix Nation, we view sales as the natural result of building strong relationships and solving customers’ problems. If you’re nodding your head right now, we’d love to meet you.  
Our sales team is the engine that keeps Terminix running. And we reward the team accordingly with a competitive salary and benefits — including medical, dental, vision, a 401(k) with company match, and more. There are also opportunities to get trained, gain new skills, and build an awesome career.

But first things first. When you start in sales at Terminix Nation, you’ll get down and dirty. You’ll learn how to inspect and identify infestations (or conditions conducive to infestations) of all kinds of organisms, insects, birds, or other pests. Sounds awesome, right? You’ll learn all about what we do and how you can make your clients’ homes safer and their lives better. Once you know that, you’ll turn your talents to proposals and presentations that result in sales.

**As a Residential Sales Professional, here’s what you can expect** 

* You won’t be tied to a desk. You’ll be out and about — mobile, independent, and growing your career on your own terms. You’ll be the face of Terminix to your local community (with the backing of a national brand), and your clients will count on you to protect their homes and their families.
* When you first join Terminix Nation, you’ll spend a few months in training. Once you’ve got that and some state required licenses and certificates under your belt, you’ll take the lead with your own customers.
* You’ll get rewarded with competitive pay and robust benefits to cover you and your family. As a teammate, you will be eligible for a 401(k) with company match, company-paid life insurance, tuition reimbursement, and a generous student loan repayment program. You put in the work, and you’ll reap the rewards.
* You’ll be part of a community – bonus points if you’re already a leader in yours. Our bonds are strong at Terminix Nation and the relationships we develop in the communities we serve are unparalleled. Our teammates give back through volunteering, donations, scholarships, and more.
* You’ll be onboarded and trained by the best of ’em. You’ll get paid to get licensed, something you’ll have for a lifetime. You’ll know how to bust bugs at home, too.

**What your days will look like**

* Hit the books with training modules and hit the streets with on-the-job training with your teammates. You’ll learn product knowledge and sales techniques for selling the full suite of Terminix products. We’ll train and support you through state licensing and other company requirements.
* You’ll inspect and assess pest problems with precision and suggest Terminix solutions following company policy and pricing instructions.
* You must be obsessed with the customer’s experience — delivering exceptional service, following up to ensure satisfaction, and thinking creatively about how to grow the relationship. And if an account is delinquent, you’ll need to handle that with grace and effectiveness, too.
* Of course, you’ve got to like to sell solutions to problems. You will be expected to meet and greet potential customers to generate new business for the branch.
* There’s an opportunity to grow into a role you’re passionate about and fits your skillset — whether that’s management or another opportunity at Terminix.

**Some non-negotiables**  
There are some things you’ll just need to have or know to join Terminix Nation as a Residential Sales Professional.

* A high school education or GED.
* A valid driver’s license from your current state of residence.
* Strong social, customer service, and communication skills — in fact, we’d be really impressed if you came to this role with related experience and/or training in sales.
* Some basic math skills — add, subtract, multiply, and divide in all units of measure, using whole numbers, common fractions, and decimals. You’ll need to be able to follow instructions for mixing on product labels.

**Straight talk about the physical demands of our work**

We’re not going to sugarcoat it. The essential functions of this job have some physical demands (of course, reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the essential functions.) Here’s what we mean:

* You’ve got to be able to move up to 10 lbs. regularly and 11–20 lbs. frequently, whether that’s lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, or otherwise repositioning objects.
* You’ll move around a lot — regularly sitting, climbing, balancing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, and crawling. You’ll go up and down stairs, ladders, scaffolding, ramps, and poles. And you’ll need to keep your balance when walking, standing, or crouching on narrow, slippery, or moving surfaces. (You’ll definitely get your steps in.)
* You must be able to safely operate a motor vehicle and make sure it and all other equipment is kept clean.
* The vision to perform detail-oriented activities at distances close to the eyes or within arm’s reach.
* Sometimes you’ll need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE), like an OSHA-compliant respirator, and you’ll need to be okay with regularly working in confined spaces, narrow aisles, or passageways (you know, where critters live).

Here, students will persevere through any obstacle and blossom into the best version of themselves.


**No Limits**. At PAVE, the possibilities are endless, and we will not settle for less than our best. PAVE classrooms focus deeply on the academic growth and achievement of our students, as well as their social and emotional development. We maintain high expectations for our students and for ourselves and commit to providing the care, coaching, and communication needed for students and staff to learn, grow, and shine.  

  

**Bright Starts. Vibrant Futures.** At PAVE, our classrooms are bright in aesthetic and vibrant with learning. Our teachers and students engage with one another enthusiastically and embrace the challenge and rigor of the work with joy. Fun is not an add on; it is an essential component of the PAVE experience. We believe that a life and love of learning starts here.


**Lift every Voice.** At PAVE, every voice matters. We value diverse perspectives and insights within our community. We encourage our students to engage with one another and express themselves with both power and respect. As our students prepare to enter the world beyond PAVE, it is our responsibility to ensure that our students are equipped with excellent character and are empowered to use their voice effectively to advocate for  

themselves and others.


**Lift Every Voice.** At PAVE, we acknowledge that systemic racism and bias have had their grips on our community for far too long. We create inclusive and equitable spaces where everyone belongs, everyone matters, and everyone is loved. ""Hate cannot drive out Hate. Only Love can do that"" (King, 1963). We endeavor to bring out the best in our students and each other by, with, and through love. This, we believe, is justice in action.
