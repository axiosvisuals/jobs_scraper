### **Description**

The Department of Epidemiology and Health Promotion seeks motivated applicants with training and experience in epidemiology, public health, or the equivalent to join our team. The postdoctoral researcher position is available in the department, working with the Department Chair Dr. Fernando Neves Hugo.



The dental research community has largely neglected the oral health of vulnerable populations. Few studies have evaluated the adequacy of dental care delivery models or the effectiveness of health promotion and oral health prevention interventions in these groups.



The postdoctoral researcher will benefit from unique resources within the Department and College of Dentistry, including the Oral Health Center for People with Disabilities. The Center provides comprehensive dental care for patients whose disabilities or medical conditions prevent them from receiving care in conventional dental settings and is one the largest of its kind in New York State.



Responsibilities include organizing data collection within the NYU Dentistry Oral Health Center for Persons with Disabilities, exploring research opportunities and preparing grant proposals under leadership of the Department Chair, analyzing existing data, preparing manuscripts, preparing research briefs for outreach to local communities/leadership to improve dissemination of our research, and career development. Opportunities for teaching and mentoring undergraduate and graduate students are available. NYU provides extensive opportunities for career development.


*In compliance with NYC’s Pay Transparency Act, the annual base salary range for this position is $65,00.00- $75,000.00. New York University considers factors such as (but not limited to) the specific grant funding and the terms of the research grant when extending an offer.*


**About the Department**



The Department of Epidemiology and Health Promotion is an interdisciplinary department in the College of Dentistry with expertise across the public health sciences, including biostatistics, epidemiology, health economics, dissemination and implementation science, health services research, health behavior, and global health. Its mission is to improve the health of human populations and reduce disparities by:
* Expanding knowledge of factors affecting oral health


* Preventing and treating oral diseases


* Advancing diverse research methods and supporting large-scale program implementation


* Providing technical assistance to organizations and governments on effective ways of improving oral health equity


* Training the next generation of innovative dental public health scholars and professionals.



Department faculty design and implement observational and intervention studies in both population and clinical settings, applying complex analytic methods to understand the determinants of health and disease, the efficacy and efficiency of interventions, and the structure and financing of oral/dental health care at the population level.

  



### **Qualifications**

Successful candidates should have a PhD in Epidemiology or Public Health, with a strong background quantitative methods, social epidemiology, clinical epidemiology, and statistics. Experience with R, SAS or Stata is required. Familiarity with oral health research is important but not required.

### **The Roku Culture**



Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor.

We’re independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.



We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

### **About the team**



The world is cutting the cord and streaming its TV online, a shift that has dramatically changed how advertisers target, reach and measure their preferred audiences in ways that broadcast TV and cable never could.



Roku Ads Manager is our answer to the growing demand in streaming advertising. Our self-serve platform just entered General Availability (GA) in September 2024 and has picked up major momentum. Our Ads Manager team is small, gritty, and focused on scaling the best streaming ad platform in the market. We move fast, pivot quickly, and work hard. We rally around decisions, challenge assumptions, and push the limits on what advertising can do for growth marketers, performance agencies, and any other business interested in making the big screen work for their brands’ objectives.  

The Roku Ads Manager team is looking for a Sales Development Representative to help us scale our platform.

### 


### **About the role**



TV ads were once reserved for large national brands. Roku believes that it’s better for streamers, brands, and our company that all businesses have a path to advertising in streaming. Roku Ads Manager is our answer to democratizing streaming advertising, creating a self-serve path for businesses of any size to get their brand on the big screen.



Roku Ads Manager is looking for a Sales Development Representative (SDR) to help lead demand generation and client growth for our self-serve streaming ad platform. This role will join two existing SDRs and will play a crucial role in attracting and onboarding new advertisers, ensuring their success on the platform, and driving revenue growth.

Use creative solutions to segment the market, build addressable lead list cohorts, and prioritize those for maximum return on outreach (i.e. sign ups + revenue).
* **Outreach:** Initiate contact with potential advertisers through various channels, including email, platform-direct messaging, zoom calls, and social media. Clearly communicate the value proposition of our self-serve ad platform and how it can meet the advertiser's objectives.
* **Qualification:** Qualify leads to ensure they align with the ideal customer profile and are likely to benefit from the platform. Once qualified, ensure these advertisers have the resources and info they need to start spending, offering onboarding services if required.
* **Onboarding:** Assist qualified new advertisers in setting up their accounts and campaigns, as needed. This includes answering questions, recommending best practices, and demoing the platform directly to brands. Once onboarded, you’ll have the chance to grow the leads you feel have potential for meaningful revenue impact.
* **Nurture & Support:** Cultivate relationships with top brands to encourage long-term engagement and loyalty. Collaborate with advertisers to optimize their campaigns for better performance. Gather feedback from brands, beneficial to both advertiser growth and Roku product improvements. Answer questions from advertisers via our support channels.
* **Upselling:** Identify opportunities for upselling additional features or services to existing advertisers. Collaborate with other teams to maximize revenue from existing clients.
* **Reporting:** Generate and provide regular reports to management on key metrics, conversion rates, and the overall success of our platform. Monitor and analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess the success of ad campaigns on the platform.


In summary, Ads Manager SDRs play a pivotal role in driving customer acquisition, ensuring successful onboarding, and fostering ongoing relationships with advertisers to maximize revenue and satisfaction. SDRs are directly responsible for building relationships and helping clients and agencies drive business results through consultative selling, education, and client service.  

Ideal candidates will have the ability to drive advertisers’ marketing strategy coupled with a willingness to roll up their sleeves and execute the tactics. Success in this position requires exceptional prioritization skills to differentiate service by priority accounts while delivering best-in-class customer service to everyone.

The role is fast-paced in a particularly high-growth area, requiring the ability to work autonomously in an ever-changing environment.



Sound like fun?

**Background**


Opened to the public in 1935, The Frick Collection is a world-renowned art museum consisting of more than 1,800 works of art from the ninth to the nineteenth centuries displayed in the intimate surroundings of the former home of Pittsburgh industrialist Henry Clay Frick. It is considered one of the world's most perfect museums and the residence is one of New York City’s few remaining Gilded Age mansions. The Frick welcomes nearly 300,000 visitors a year to its tranquil mansion on the Upper East Side, encouraging visitors to closely observe, reflect, and engage with its esteemed collection.


The Frick Art Reference Library, founded by Mr. Frick’s daughter, Helen Clay Frick, in 1920, is an internationally recognized research library that serves as one of the world's most complete resources for the study of Western art.

Construction has progressed rapidly and, in addition to special exhibition galleries, education spaces we have added enhanced visitor amenities and accessible spaces.
