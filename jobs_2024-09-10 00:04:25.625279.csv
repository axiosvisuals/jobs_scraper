The Center for Justice Innovation is a community justice organization that centers safety and racial justice. Since our founding in 1996, the Center has partnered with community members, courts, and the people most impacted to create stronger, healthier, more just communities. Our decades of experience in courts and communities, coupled with our field-leading research and practitioner expertise, help us drive justice nationwide in innovative, powerful, and durable ways. For more information on how and where we work, please visit www.innovatingjustice.org.


The Center is a 900-employee, $100 million nonprofit that accomplishes its vision through three pillars of work: creating and scaling operating programs to test new ideas and solve problems, performing original research to determine what works (and what doesn’t), and providing expert assistance and policy guidance to justice reformers around the world.

**Operating Programs**


The Center’s operating programs, including the award-winning Red Hook Community Justice Center and Midtown Community Justice Center, test new ideas, solve difficult problems, and attempt to achieve systemic change within the justice system. Our projects include community-based violence prevention programs, alternatives to incarceration, reentry initiatives, and court-based initiatives that reduce the use of unnecessary incarceration and promote positive individual and family change. Through this programming, we have produced tangible results like safer streets, reduced incarceration, and improved neighborhood perceptions of justice.

**Research**


The Center's research teams are staffed with social scientists, data analysts, and lawyers who are academically-trained or have lived experience and who conduct research in the U.S. and globally on diverse criminal-legal system and justice issues. Their work includes evaluating programs and policies; conducting exploratory, community-based studies; and providing research translation and strategic planning for system actors. The Center has published studies on topics including court and jail reform, intimate partner violence, restorative justice, gun violence, reentry, sixth amendment rights, and progressive prosecution. The research teams strive to make their work meaningful and actionable to the communities they work with, policymakers, and practitioners.

**Policy & Expert Assistance**


The Center provides hands-on, planning and implementation assistance to a wide range of jurisdictions in areas of reform such as problem-solving courts (e.g., community courts, treatment courts, domestic violence courts), tribal justice, reducing incarceration and the use of fines/fees and reducing crime and violence. Our current expert assistance takes many forms, including help with analyzing data, strategic planning and consultation, policy guidance, and hosting site visits to its operating programs in the New York City area.

**Center Support**


A dedicated support team within the Center ensures the smooth functioning of operations across various domains, including finance, legal, technology, human resources, fundraising, real estate, and communications. Comprising 15% of the organization's staff, these teams provide essential infrastructure support and innovative solutions aligned with the Center's mission and values.

Our impact measurement centers on creating connections, changing mindsets, and inspiring action.

Originally constructed as part of the Grand Central Terminal expansion, our luxury hotel in Manhattan became one of four notable railroad hotels built to service the well-heeled men and women travelling to New York City. Its convenient location, directly above the railroad tracks, permitted the hotel the unique distinction of having its own platform in the basement, ideal for the upscale rail traveler who occasionally arrived by private train car. In addition to its Midtown East location, the hotel made an immediate impact with tenants and critics alike for its characteristic atmosphere of comfort and elegant domesticity. From that moment, The Barclay began to write its history as the hotel of choice for those looking to take respite in this stately residential hotel of international prestige.



Today, the InterContinental New York Barclay remains Manhattan’s preeminent luxury hotel in New York City after undergoing the most ambitious restoration in its history. Combining sophistication and contemporary design, while staying true to its original Federalist style details, The Barclay exudes confidence and warmth, delivering the same residential feel with modern comfort and flexibility introduced to the world in 1926.



Our hotel boasts over 700 guest rooms, including 32 unique suites, and 20,000 square feet of meeting space. Our Club InterContinental combines personal service and exclusive privileges to make our guests stay extra special. And as the city continues to evolve, so does The Barclay, with spectacular renovations and sustainability initiatives.

Mount Sinai is one of the largest non-profit U.S. health systems, with a strong reputation for research/education (18th ranked U.S. medical school, >$400m in NIH-funded research) and quality of care (Top ranked hospital in N.Y. State). Traditions are important, but at Mount Sinai, we are looking for people to join our team who want to innovate and make health care better.



Mount Sinai Solutions was created to drastically change the way people interact with health care. Medicine has become increasingly fragmented and transactional, resulting in ineffective patient care, provider burnout, and wasteful use of time and money. Our team is shifting the way people interact with health care by increasing access to high quality, in-network providers with an incredible patient experience. Our offerings include next-generation primary care at or near the workplace (“Health Centers”) through our Health Centers Direct (HCD) team, centers of excellence (COE) for specialty care through our Specialty Care Direct (SCD team), and next-generation health benefit plans in partnership with health plans. Our group also includes a Business Development (BD) team that explores new partnerships across the healthcare landscape that can improve value for our customers and for the Mount Sinai Health System. Our team markets & sells these products directly to the purchaser – i.e., consumers, large employers, labor unions.



A flagship of our business is The Health Center at Hudson Yards (HCHY); a 15,000 square-foot, state-of-the-art multi-specialty practice designed around patient experience. HCHY houses two distinct membership-based practices – one that provides comprehensive and convenient care to employees in the area, and another that provides outstanding concierge-level service and amenities to individuals seeking an unrivaled health care experience. https://www.healthcenterhudsonyards.com/about/

Business Health and Mount Sinai Solutions are increasingly unifying efforts related to their common focus on relationships with companies and unions.

We also know that we have a responsibility to the planet and to humanity to choose eco-friendly fabrics and to support our factory workers, without compromise.
