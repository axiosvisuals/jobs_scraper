**Job Overview**
----------------


You’ll be part of the Amazon grocery team that supports one of Amazon’s busiest services: online grocery orders.

* **Dress code.** Relaxed, with a few rules to follow for safety. Comfortable, closed-toe shoes are required and protective safety footwear are required in select business units.
