At Chick-fil-A Teterboro Landing FSR our purpose is “to enrich lives on both sides of the counter, by creating a culture of care.” Our biggest focus is on our team members. We understand that if we can positively influence and impact our team, then that will overflow into a genuine care to provide excellent service that goes above and beyond to our guests.
  
  

Why should you apply with us today? Please allow me to give you three reasons.
  
  

1. Engaged Leadership - We have a leadership team that is on your side. It is our goal to help you win and help you become the best version of yourself. Whether Chick-fil-A is just a stepping stone or a career path, our goal is to develop life and leadership skills that will make you successful and competitive no matter where you go!
  
2. Opportunities for growth - We are a rapidly growing restaurant and we are constantly looking to develop talented leaders that have a passion to serve and help others. Opportunities include trainers, team leaders, shift leaders, directors of operations, marketing, talent, training and hospitality are all leadership positions within our restaurant. Not only are there in-restaurant opportunities, but the talents and leadership skills developed at Chick-fil-A can be used in whatever work environment you decide to pursue.
  
3. Impact and purpose - Chick-fil-A of Teterboro Landing FSR is looking to create an impact in our local communities by providing donations with local schools, churches, charitable organizations and even other businesses. Among this, we partner with a local church to help serve the homeless and those of lower opportunity.

Requirements/Responsibilities
  
Do you have what we're looking for?
  
  

There are really 5 crucial that we look for in our team members. We believe that out of these 5 things, most other qualities or requirements will flow naturally.
  
  

1. Reliable - We are looking for individuals that we can count on. We need to be able to trust that you will arrive punctually to each shift you’ve been assigned, and that you will accomplish the tasks assigned to you.
  
2. Integrity - We want a committed team that we can trust to handle ALL guest interactions with the utmost care. We also understand the importance of teamwork, which means there needs to be a level of trust that is deep and genuine with the attitude of a servant’s heart. You must be trustworthy in all circumstances in order to gain the trust of individuals.
  
3. Hungry - (I’m sorry, but this doesn’t relate to food;) We are looking for individuals who have a passion for growth. Hungry team members take efforts to improve themselves during and outside of work, they have plans for bettering themselves. Hungry team members are always striving to do and accomplish more even when others don’t see anything that needs to be done. In other words, you push hard and strive to be the best you can.
  
4. Humble - Humility is the lynchpin of being on a team. If you can’t admit weaknesses, confess mistakes and ask for help from others, this will be a difficult job for you. Everyone makes mistakes, but it’s how we humble ourselves so others can address us, and how we learn from them that matters.
  
5. Smart - This refers to both being smart intellectually, but more importantly, to emotional intelligence. It means that you are wise in communicating, and understand the impact that your words, attitude or body language can have. It means understanding people and knowing what or what not to say, and when or when not to say it.
  
  

These are some of the main qualities that we are looking for in our team members. As I have said before, teamwork is so important to everything done in the restaurant. If you are not looking for a place that will challenge you to grow, incur great communication, and push you to put others first, you will not enjoy working here. We are heavily invested in character development and striving to bring out the best in each of our team members.

The Center for Justice Innovation (formerly the Center for Court Innovation) is a non-profit organization that works with communities and justice systems to advance equity, increase safety, and help individuals and communities thrive. The Center's goal is to identify and resolve as early as possible the challenges that bring people into the criminal and civil legal systems. It does this in a number of ways—by developing and running programs that reduce the need for incarceration and enhance economic opportunity, conducting original research to identify what works, and sharing what we learn from our programming and research with those seeking to transform the justice system around the world.


The Center is a 900-employee, $100 million nonprofit that accomplishes its vision through three pillars of work: creating and scaling operating programs to test new ideas and solve problems, performing original research to determine what works (and what doesn’t), and providing expert assistance and policy guidance to justice reformers around the world.

**Operating Programs**

Through this programming, we have produced tangible results like safer streets, reduced incarceration, and improved neighborhood perceptions of justice.

**Research**

The Center has published studies on topics including court and jail reform, intimate partner violence, restorative justice, gun violence, reentry, sixth amendment rights, and progressive prosecution. The research teams strive to make their work meaningful and actionable to the communities they work with, policymakers, and practitioners.

**Policy & Expert Assistance**


The Center provides hands-on, planning and implementation assistance to a wide range of jurisdictions in areas of reform such as problem-solving courts (e.g., community courts, treatment courts, domestic violence courts), tribal justice, reducing incarceration and the use of fines/fees and reducing crime and violence. Our current expert assistance takes many forms, including help with analyzing data, strategic planning and consultation, policy guidance, and hosting site visits to its operating programs in the New York City area.

(CFR)is an award-winning, innovative law and policy organization that serves primarily Black and Brown families and youth in Queens, Manhattan, and the Bronx with an interdisciplinary legal defense model that serves more than 2400 clients every year. In 2024, CFR will expand our family defense practice to Richmond County. CFR was originally founded in 2002 to dramatically change the trajectory of indigent parents being prosecuted by the Citys Administration for Childrens Services (ACS). Our goal is to defend and protect our clients rights, reduce the harm of family separation and prevent or minimize the time any child spends in the foster system.


CFR provides interdisciplinary family defense with a model that was unique at our founding and that is now being replicated nationally: we assign every client an attorney and a social work staff member, and teams have the support of parent advocates, who are parents with direct personal experience of being investigated and prosecuted by ACS. CFR was the first agency in the country to integrate parents with lived experience into legal teams and now has 7 parent advocates working in all three of our family defense locations. CFRsCommunity Advocacy Projectrepresents parents during a child protective investigation (to avoid court involvement where possible) and assists parents in clearing their names from state maltreatment records.


As an agency committed to securing justice for families, we built theYouth Defense practice (YDP)to defend youth at risk of family separation through incarceration. YDP uses the same interdisciplinary model to represent youth being prosecuted in Queens and Manhattan in Supreme Court Youth Parts, during Probation Adjustment and in Delinquency proceedings in Family Court. CFRs Home for Good program provides legal and social work services to CFR clients inimmigration,civil legal servicesandcriminal defensematters, to afford clients an efficient and well-coordinated one-stop solution to a range of issues that threaten family stability.

(CFR)is an award-winning, innovative law and policy organization that serves primarily Black and Brown families and youth in Queens, Manhattan, and the Bronx with an interdisciplinary legal defense model that serves more than 2400 clients every year. In 2024, CFR will expand our family defense practice to Richmond County. CFR was originally founded in 2002 to dramatically change the trajectory of indigent parents being prosecuted by the Citys Administration for Childrens Services (ACS). Our goal is to defend and protect our clients rights, reduce the harm of family separation and prevent or minimize the time any child spends in the foster system.


CFR provides interdisciplinary family defense with a model that was unique at our founding and that is now being replicated nationally: we assign every client an attorney and a social work staff member, and teams have the support of parent advocates, who are parents with direct personal experience of being investigated and prosecuted by ACS. CFR was the first agency in the country to integrate parents with lived experience into legal teams and now has 7 parent advocates working in all three of our family defense locations. CFRsCommunity Advocacy Projectrepresents parents during a child protective investigation (to avoid court involvement where possible) and assists parents in clearing their names from state maltreatment records.


As an agency committed to securing justice for families, we built theYouth Defense practice (YDP)to defend youth at risk of family separation through incarceration. YDP uses the same interdisciplinary model to represent youth being prosecuted in Queens and Manhattan in Supreme Court Youth Parts, during Probation Adjustment and in Delinquency proceedings in Family Court. CFRs Home for Good program provides legal and social work services to CFR clients inimmigration,civil legal servicesandcriminal defensematters, to afford clients an efficient and well-coordinated one-stop solution to a range of issues that threaten family stability.


Recognized as experts in our fields,we annually train over 500 practitioners in the city, state and around the countryon strategies to promote family preservation and interdisciplinary representation, and we provide community based Know Your Rights presentations to parents, youth and service providers.We advocate at the city, state and national level for policies that reduce the harm of family separation, and promote parent engagement and justice for youth and families.


CFR has an immediate opening for a **Staff Attorney** in its **Youth Defense Practice (YDP)**.


Under the supervision and guidance of CFRs Youth Defense Supervisors, the Staff Attorneys core responsibilities will be to represent clients charged on juvenile delinquency matters in Family Court, as well as clients charged as adolescent and juvenile offenders (AO and JO) on cases in the Supreme Court Youth Parts whose cases are being removed to family court.


The candidate will receive training on youth and family defense.


The candidate will work collaboratively with legal teams, composed of attorneys, social work staff, investigators, and paralegals (clients legal teams may also involve staff from CFRs immigration or housing/public benefits units).


The position will be based out of Manhattan, however candidates should expect to occasionally appear in Queens or the Bronx.


The candidate should also expect to maintain new and evolving youth defense data in Case Management System and client legal notes; keep files up to date; keep additional data related to deliverables for private funders supporting the Youth Defense Practice, and/or to meet with prospective and current funders; and help to inform and grow CFRs Youth Defense Practice. This person may also participate in community based outreach and presentations for families whose youth are impacted by or are at risk of juvenile justice involvement.


The ideal candidate will enjoy the opportunity to wear multiple hats, learn a lot and enjoy working with teams.
