Liberty Subaru's Internet Sales Department is not like your traditional Internet Sales team at most dealerships. Most will use what is referred to as a BDC Department or Business Development Center. BDC representatives will make calls throughout the day to pull their leads into the door.

We are a little different here. We are with our clients from start to finish. This is key to building a long-lasting relationship. We call, email, assess needs, schedule appointments, test drive, build and price vehicles, train on all features and maintenance intervals. The key to our success is building rapport with our clients from day one when we first email or call them. We meet their expectations, exceed them, and continue to deliver great service months and years after they have purchased their vehicle.

**Student & Family Engagement Coordinator-Middle States Region, Jersey City**

 **About CSS**


Center for Supportive Schools (CSS) is an anti-racist, fast-paced, collegial, and team-oriented organization wholly committed to helping schools become places where students want to be. Our work directly addresses student disengagement, a root cause of diminished academic performance, students dropping out of school, and other high-risk student behaviors. We partner with schools in three areas: developing all students into leaders; empowering teachers to collaborate with each other and with students; and engaging entire school communities to improve how learning happens.  



  

CSS is driven by the vision that one day, all students will thrive in schools that graduate them prepared for the rigors of college and lives filled with meaningful work, active citizenship, and personal fulfillment.  



  

We are committed to antiracism. Our vision for students will not be realized absent the dismantling of systemic racism that permeates schools and society. Schools are not safe, supportive, engaging, and inspiring unless they address all areas of marginalization and eradicate all the many interconnected forms of oppression. CSS's focus on antiracism results from the outsized role that racism has played in shaping the United States and its institutions, from the fact that racism intersects with all other forms of oppression and given that which we learn and develop-tools, frameworks, resources-in dismantling racism can be leveraged to abolish all other forms of oppression.

  

Founded in 1979, we are a national organization currently impacting 65,000 students annually and committed to supporting every K-12 school in the country. Most of our partners are economically disadvantaged communities where the consequences of student disengagement can be most devastating.

**About Community Schools**


Community Schools offer a holistic approach toward improving academic performance driven by strong, collaborative partnerships among principals, parents, teachers, and CBOs. In Community Schools, parents are real and active partners in their children's education. Each student is connected to a mentor, club, or social service. The school climate is joyful and positive. Community members spend time at the school, participating in activities ranging from athletics and yoga to financial and parenting workshops. Extended afterschool or weekend classes are commonplace. An integral part of this approach is the blending of school- and community-based services into the school day, such as health, mental health, counseling, and academic enrichment.
