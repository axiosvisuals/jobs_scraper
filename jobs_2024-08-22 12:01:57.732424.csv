 **Job Description** **What to expect when you work here**


As a Merchandiser, you will be responsible for managing the store's backroom operations by receiving products into the POS system, keeping products organized and accounted for, and helping process weekly pallets.

**Share The Road:**

* We take the health, safety, and wellness of our employees seriously. Our Wellness program and safety committee offers workshops, classes, resources, etc. to all of our team members
* Our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion council and employee resource groups promote open and honest communication, remove barriers, and champion policies to build a more equitable environment
* Do the right thing, always. A friendly and upbeat personality is a must
