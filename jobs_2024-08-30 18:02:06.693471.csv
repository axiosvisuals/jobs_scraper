* **Instructional Assistance:** Associate teachers support instructional delivery by working with small groups of students or individual students who may require additional attention or assistance while the lead teacher leads the whole group. They may reinforce concepts, provide clarification, or guide students through specific learning tasks based on data collected. Associate teachers also collect data while the lead teacher is teaching.

Do you see yourself as a *Security Manager*?


Since first opening its doors in 1926, the InterContinental New York Barclay has welcomed countless guests to enjoy a luxurious residential-style experience in the heart of the city. Originally constructed as part of the Grand Central Terminal expansion, our luxury hotel in Manhattan became one of four notable railroad hotels built to service the well-heeled men and women travelling to New York City. It's convenient location, directly above the railroad tracks, permitted the hotel the unique distinction of having its own platform in the basement, ideal for the upscale rail traveler who occasionally arrived by private train car. In addition to its Midtown East location, the hotel made an immediate impact with tenants and critics alike for its characteristic atmosphere of comfort and elegant domesticity. From that moment, The Barclay began to write its history as the hotel of choice for those looking to take respite in this stately residential hotel of international prestige.



Today, the InterContinental New York Barclay remains Manhattan’s preeminent luxury hotel in New York City after undergoing the most ambitious restoration in its history. Combining sophistication and contemporary design, while staying true to its original Federalist style details, The Barclay exudes confidence and warmth, delivering the same residential feel with modern comfort and flexibility introduced to the world in 1926.



Our hotel boasts over 704 guest rooms, including 32 unique suites, and 20,000 square feet of meeting space. Our Club InterContinental combines personal service and exclusive privileges to make our guests stay extra special. And as the city continues to evolve, so does The Barclay, with spectacular renovations and sustainability initiatives.
