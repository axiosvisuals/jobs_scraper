Our company originally opened in Boston in 2007 (Boston City Properties was our first office). We expanded nationally. We currently have 13 very small offices in 13 states.

**Leads**

We give at least 20+ leads per week. The leads come in from a variety of sources. We've had the exact same system since 2007 and it works with a small group. We're under water leads.

*Residential leads:* We are also flooded with residential buyer leads for those interested in residential leads. The leads come from a variety of sources including Zillow. We do periodically provide seller leads, however the leads we provide are mainly buyer leads. We also provide a flood of apartment renter leads.

**Split Info**

We provide clients with agents at a 50/50 split. Agent's own leads start off at 75% for the first 3 years. A $5,000 cap system for agents own leads is implemented for agents who have been with the company for 3 years. After the 3 year mark, agents keep 100% for the rest of the year for their own leads after $5,000 comes in on a 75/25 split. Company leads continue at a 50/50 split. It's a 100% split for agents that buy or sell their own properties.

The split is non-negotiable; please only apply if you are okay with the split system.

Shaker & Spoon is a small but innovative food business with an industrial kitchen/warehouse in Red Hook, Brooklyn. We produce monthly curated cocktail kits (think Blue Apron for craft cocktails) and ship them all over the country along with a variety of supporting products. Our small yet mighty team is focused on sustainably growing the company and creating unique, fun products that resonate with our customer community. We pride ourselves on running an ethical company that sources high-quality products from other small and medium-sized businesses, and treats people with dignity, care, and respect.

**Who are you?**

A detail-oriented, and self-motivated problem solver who wants an interesting, flexible gig in an environment with good vibes that will schedule you based on your availability. Good communication and organizational skills are a big plus. Ideally you’re a grounded team player, able to roll with the punches when things don't go as planned. Versatility and flexibility will definitely help—if you're able to wear different hats and to juggle various tasks with ease, you'll do well here.

**What will you be doing?**

You'll put together the components for our boxes (bottling, bagging, labeling, and sorting things) as well as cooking and bottling syrups. Then comes the kitting of all of those components, either into single-recipe smaller kits or multi-recipe boxes. This is usually done assembly-line style and you get one job and do it over and over again. The work is very rote and therefore rather zen, but there's usually another task around the corner so there's always variety, plus you get to listen to music and socialize with some great people.

Our website is shakerandspoon.com, in case you'd like to see what the product that you’d be helping put together looks like—subscription boxes of cocktail kits that include syrups, bitters, mixers, citrus, and the like. They're slightly different each month, but the concept stays the same.

We work in an industrial kitchen / warehouse space at 71 and 65 Commerce St, Brooklyn, NY 11231. Since we handle food, you'll have to maintain cleanliness, proper hygiene, and food safety rules. No food or warehouse experience necessary, we'll teach you, if you have the aptitude and willingness to learn!

**There's lots of standing and some lifting of heavier items, though always with safety top of mind. You'll need to be able to use your hands and wrists all day, often for repetitive motions, so please only apply if that won't cause you problems.** 

We email and ask for availability on a week-to-week basis if we have any shifts to offer you, usually 4-7 days prior to the shift (though sometimes with less lead time, even potentially the night before in certain circumstances). **The work is not guaranteed, but if you're helpful, we will have shifts for you for at least the next 4 months through the holidays, and the schedule is flexible--we book staff based on their availability!** You're never required to book any shifts that you don't wish to book, though once you have booked it, we do rely on you to show up.

You will need to prove that you're legally eligible to work in the US. The pay starts at $16/hr, but the lunch break is paid, so the effective rate for hours worked is just over $17/hr.

**The shifts run Monday-Friday from 8:30am til 4:30pm.** 

Everyone working here is **required to be vaccinated against COVID-19** and must share their proof of vaccination. We also encourage everyone to get the latest boosters to protect themselves and everyone around them!

This is a great, flexible gig for someone looking for a nice work environment with great, kind people in a bustling, small-business setting.

**Main Responsibilities**

● Perform all aspects of production--assemble kits; cook and bottle syrups; wash, peel, and slice produce; sort and bag garnishes; vial bitters and oils; etc--sometimes individually and sometimes as part of a larger team.

● Assist in kitchen cleanup and upkeep.  
● Help count inventory.  
● Safely pack packages and shipments.

● Move boxes and pallets around the facility as needed.

**Requirements include:**

● Good communication skills  
● Attention to detail

● Kind to coworkers  
● Good sense of what you don't know or understand and ability to ask questions  
● Being organized and wanting to be helpful  
● Ready to conquer any task—must be a team player  
● Ability to lift 50+ lbs over the course of the day a big plus  
● Must be able to stand for long periods of time and to use your hands and wrists for repetitive tasks all day long (not the same task all the time, but all of them using the hands in some way)
