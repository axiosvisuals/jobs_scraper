Our three-pronged, research-backed, anti-racist approach includes: 1) healing circles, 2) school leadership capacity building, and 3) interactive workshops.

We work with schools, school districts, and charter networks predominantly serving students of color, as they typically have the lowest teacher retention. To date, our programming has reached over 400 educators and school leaders, and preliminary data suggest that participants are overwhelmingly satisfied and that our model demonstrates efficacy for building collective efficacy and improving teacher retention in schools, focusing on teachers of color.

As a start up, we are now working to scale our efforts within the Northeastern United States, to reach 4,500 educators by 2025. While Healing Schools Project is based in New York City, our interventions have been effective at a distance when conducted over Zoom and other online platforms. Our mix of in-person and online interventions will enable us to scale to more schools and communities at a fraction of the cost required for a program that relies entirely on in-person support.

The Director of Programming plays a critical role in cultivating partnerships and driving the success of Healing Schools Project during an exciting phase of expansion. You will spearhead program development, implementation, and evaluation efforts and lead a growing program team in delivering impactful outcomes for educators, school leaders, and school communities.

Technology - Information Security
Are you interested in building capabilities that enable the organization with innovation, speed, agility, scalability, and efficiency? The Global Technology team takes great pride in our culture where digital transformation is built into our DNA! When you join our organization at Prudential, you’ll unlock an exciting and impactful career – all while growing your skills and advancing your profession at one of the world’s leading financial services institutions.
Your Team & Role
As a Cyber Security Operations Specialist, you would be functioning as the first line of defense for the company. This position is much more than just watching an incident queue. You will have the opportunity to develop integrations, correlations, and SIEM content to better protect the environment.
The CSOC, and the larger ISO, are dynamic teams that look for self-motivated talent, meaning the CSOC will embrace and leverage the background and abilities you offer to better the overall organization. Ideal candidates will enjoy solving complex puzzles (also known as security incidents) in a fast-paced Information Security environment. Candidates would use their background in networking, operating systems, and security tools/knowledge to not just remediate any incidents that arise but also work with the senior members of the CSOC to create custom detections, alerts, and reporting to further improve the capabilities of the CSOC. Ideal candidates are comfortable working in a potentially high stakes environment while working off potentially incomplete/not ideal information/conditions.
As this position is a mid-tier Analyst, the expectation is also to help mentor and guide the more junior Analysts, while potentially covering for the shift lead. Besides the more traditional SOC work event investigation/management, you will have the opportunity to become involved in the configuration of the tools/products used by the CSOC. You will not only join a constantly evolving team but also provide their input towards the direction of the organization. Additionally, Prudential believes in keeping up/growing the technical and soft skills of our CSOC team members as they progress.
Here is What You Can Expect on a Typical Day* Analyze potential security incidents to resolve impact/scope of the incident.
* Follow and offer improvements to Incident Response procedures to perform preliminary log collection and incident investigations, determining the cause of the security incident, containing the threat, and building protections against future infections.
* Collaborate with technical personnel and other teams in the ISO as well as the larger organization as required to facilitate incident response and enhancing detective capabilities.
* Follow and offer improvements to critical issue procedures to counteract and contain potential threats.
* Appropriately inform and advise team/site/shift leads and managers on incidents and incident prevention.
* Document changes to and conform to existing processes related to security monitoring.
* Participate in knowledge sharing with other Analysts and amplify solutions efficiently.
* Conduct network, endpoint, and log analysis by applying various consoles on a regular basis (e.g., SIEM, IPS, firewall, EDR, advanced malware detection etc.).
* Leverage the toolset to investigate incidents using computer/network forensic techniques to reconstruct events, identify unknown intrusions using indicators of compromise as well as identify and track any lateral movement.
* Work closely with team members, management, and other IT teams (Workstation, Network, Server, etc.).
* Maintain the integrity and security of enterprise-wide cyber systems and networks by coordinating resources during enterprise triage/incident response efforts.
* Apply an understanding of attack signatures, tactics, techniques, and procedures associated with advanced threats, while using security domain knowledge to improve Prudential’s defenses/detection mechanisms.
* CSOC team provides 24x7x365 support and this role will be part of the Night Shift.


Qualifications:* Bachelor's degree in Information Technology, Information Security, Computer Science, or a related field; or 4 years equivalent direct work-related experience in lieu of a degree.
* Experience (3+ yrs.) in a corporate IT environment in addition to a degree.
* IT Security certifications (e.g., Security+, GSEC, GCIH, GMON, GCTI, GNFA, GCWN, GREM, OSCP etc.).
* Direct background or experience working in a SOC or other Cyber Security Operations.
* Exposure to/ knowledge of SIEM technology, preferable Splunk (ES & Phantom).
* Understanding of IT Security practices/programs.
* Documentation/process experience in IT or Cyber Security.
* Effective oral and written communication skills as well as problem solving & analytical skills.
* A deep understanding of networking concepts and tools.
* Innovative and willing to raise unique/original ideas.
* Teammate that can work with businesses around the world in different time zones and with a diverse cultural background while being supportive of local customs.
* Proven passion about the information security field and cyber defense including commitment to training, self-study, and maintaining proficiency in the technical cyber security domain.
* Automation experience and scripting background (Python, PowerShell, bash, etc.) is a huge plus.
* Familiarity with sandboxing solutions and malicious file analysis.
* Prior exposure/experience with Cyber Threat Intelligence is a plus.

South Bronx Community fosters deeper learning and promotes social justice in a culturally responsive and competency-based learning environment. This school is the newest addition to the EPIC network of schools, and is EPIC’s first charter high school.  
**What We Are About:**  
Some notable elements of our school model include the following principles and practices:  
**We are competency-based:** SBC organizes teaching and learning around a critical set of skills that students need for academic, career and life success. Teaching involves making learning targets explicit, providing students with the time and support required to reach their goals, and a process of continuous feedback. We use a mastery-based approach to grading so that students have a clear understanding of what they know and are able to do. On progress reports, students see the skills they are working on and their proficiency levels, rather than course titles and letter grades.  
**We are culturally responsive:** At SBC, strong relationships between staff and students are at the core of our learning model. We implement an advisory and rites of passage program that helps to strengthen relationships and throughout all aspects of the school including our pedagogical approaches, routines and practices. Group mentoring takes place for an extended block of time every week.  
**We are human-centered and adaptive:** At SBC, we encourage the development of all members of the school community and provide opportunities for sharing strengths and talents to enhance individual and collective performance. Significant time is built in to all staff schedules for collaborative planning and tuning of curriculum, supported by improvement science methodology and protocols.  
**We are holistic in terms of integrating academic, social and emotional and professional skills:** SBC integrates social and emotional learning into our competency framework. We strive to make all learning experiences interdisciplinary and inclusive of these skills so that students are prepared for college, careers and community. Being able to manage your relationships and demonstrate leadership can be just as important to success in life as many academic and technical skills.  
**Who We Are Looking For:**  
SBC seeks talented teachers with demonstrated desire and capacity to:  
**Innovate with curriculum and pedagogy –** We seek to support students in taking ownership of their learning. All staff participate in designing and facilitating highly engaging, rigorous learning experiences with resources and scaffolds that allow students to lead their own learning.  
**Pioneer through start-up –** Founding a new school is difficult and can be exhausting in many ways. Staff must be motivated by the challenge and opportunity to develop and design protocols, processes, tools and ultimately establish a culture for learning among young people and staff.  
**Work in community every day –** All learning experiences are interdisciplinary and so staff must be motivated to co-facilitate and co-plan with their colleagues.  
**Practice social justice –** Design, facilitate and participate in experiences and conversations that relate to race, gender, class and sexual identity in ways that empower students and foster community.  
**Be open to new roles –** All staff co-lead group mentoring sessions every week with a small group of students that they support through all four years of high school.  
**Fail forward –** We try new approaches to achieve breakthrough results. All staff contribute to, and learn from, these experiences.  
**Lead through uncertainty –** In order to achieve dramatically better outcomes for young people, sometimes there is no precedent for the strategies we employ. We need staff that can demonstrate leadership in uncharted waters.  
**Resident Teacher Responsibilities**

* Design and facilitate STEM or Humanities interdisciplinary course with a domain specialization in partnership with another teacher.
* Support students to diagnose a problem so that they can create a solution and be able to help students through the inevitable highs and lows of making something.
* Facilitate Advisory and Rites of Passage program in partnership with a Learning Coach (staff member with youth development experience).
* Develop and implement targeted small group skill development for ENL students.
* Participate in and facilitate professional learning sessions with colleagues to norm expectations, promote high quality student learning experiences, engage in inquiry, problem solve, etc.
* Participate in and facilitate restorative circles as a means of fostering student investment in community and resolving conflict.

MISSION


Updated by Board of Trustees on December 15, 2009

*Queens Botanical Garden is an urban oasis where people, plants and cultures are celebrated through inspiring gardens, innovative educational programs,* *and demonstrations of environmental stewardship.*

**Queens Botanical Garden (QBG)** is a private non-profit cultural institution located on 39 acres of New York City public land in Flushing, New York. In FY23, the Garden served 291,027 visitors, including 24,348 schoolchildren. A recently completed visitor survey reveals that 45% of visitors speak a language other than English at home. This fact underscores the importance of the mission and the challenges and opportunities QBG faces daily in creating programs, exhibits and landscapes that serve the needs of people who live in and visit one of the most ethnically diverse counties in the nation. The Garden has committed itself to addressing the complex and ever-changing needs of its diverse community and to being *the place where people, plants, and cultures meet.*
  
**Instructor** **(Part-Time/Seasonal)**

**About this Opportunity**

QBG’s Youth Programs bring together youngsters ages 2 to 18 from around New York City to enjoy seasonal, hands-on learning and gardening experiences year-round.
