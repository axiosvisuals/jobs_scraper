We make timeless clothes that last a lifetimeâ€¦then pair them with of-the-moment styles season after season, decade after decade. We think that distinct heritage pairs perfectly with modern design and fabric technology. We believe in feel-good colorâ€¦ Even if black or navy makes you feel best, weâ€™re here for that. Weâ€™re the experts in signature categories: cashmere, coats, blazers, pantsâ€”and we also collaborate with the coolest brands out there because we know that creativity is contagious. We consider leopard a neutral, speak stripes fluently and live for a great gingham. We believe in looking like a million bucks, not spending itâ€”which is why we go the extra mile to source the absolute best fabrics at the most accessible prices. We also know that we have a responsibility to the planet and to humanity to choose eco-friendly fabrics and to support our factory workers, without compromise.
