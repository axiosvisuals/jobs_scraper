 **About Dave's Hot Chicken**  

  

**Dave’s Hot Chicken was created by best friends Dave Kopushyan, Arman Oganesyan, and Tommy and Gary Rubenyan. Dave, a chef trained in Thomas Keller’s (French Laundry) organization set out to create the perfect Hot Chicken by searching, tasting, and frying. The four friends scrounged up $900 to put a tiny stand in an East Hollywood parking lot. The menu was simple, and the chicken was the star. And what chicken it is! Sourced and prepared to be the juiciest and most tender imaginable with each piece topped with Dave’s own mix of spices ranging from No Spice to “The Reaper.”**  

  

**Arman created Instagram buzz and the lines began to grow. Two nights later, Eater/LA showed up to see what the fuss was about. The next morning's headline read ""East Hollywood's Late Night Chicken Stand Might Blow Your Mind."" Almost instantly, the lines stretched around the block.**  

  

**A year later, the boys had the money to open a shop in a hip strip-mall with décor by local street artists, where the crowds continued to grow with wait-times of an hour and more. From there, the incredibly craveable “Hot and Spicy” varieties have created a cult following with rave reviews across the U.S. and Canada.**
