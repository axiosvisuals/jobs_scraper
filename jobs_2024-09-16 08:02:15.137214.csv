Notion uses RippleMatch to find top talent.**

  



### **About Us:**



We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.



We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.



Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day). ***This internship will take place from January - April and you will need to be able to work out of our NY or SF office during this time.***


### **About The Role:**



Millions of people use Notion — and this number is increasing every day. That means a million people trust us to deliver a fast, reliable, and secure experience, and we value this more than anything. We want to keep earning trust, while also continuing to amaze our users with the tools they can build in Notion. This is where you come in. You will be a part of our first engineering internship class and will help us forge a performant and reliable path forward to Notion's future.



During your 12-week internship, you will be paired with a mentor that will help guide you as you work closely with our team to build and ship impactful projects. These projects will drive valuable impact to our customers and engineers. From product engineering, mobile, to infrastructure and security, we have opportunities available on different teams. Take a look at what our past intern cohort worked on with our Blog post here and here and TikTok post.


### **What You'll Achieve:**


* Write clean, secure, tested, and documented code.
* Design & enhance the Notion platform with new capabilities, as and when the need arises.
* Design, develop, and own new product functionality and/or infrastructure leveraging modern frameworks and tooling.
* Develop, fix and debug software for web services, databases, applications, tools, networks.

### **Qualifications:**


* Pursuing a bachelor's or master's degree in computer science, engineering, or another related field. Targeting a 2025 or early 2026 full-time start date and must graduate in between June 2025 - December 2025.
* Previous internship experience.
* Working towards a proficiency of one or more programming languages such as Typescript, Node.js, Go, Python, Java, Swift, Rust, or Kotlin.
* You find large challenges exciting and enjoy discovering problems as much as solving them.
* You are able to problem-solve and adapt to changing priorities in a fast-paced, dynamic environment.
* This internship will take place from Jan - Apr and you will need to be able to work out of our NY or SF office during this time.

### **Skills You'll Need To Bring:**


* **Thoughtful problem-solving:** For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.
* **For a backend internship:** You have a passion for learning how parts of a system fit together—from the user interface to the data model. Familiarity with relational database systems like Postgres or MySQL is a plus.
* **For a frontend internship:** You have a passion for learning technologies (CSS, Javascript, & React) and best practices in front-end architecture, including performance, accessibility and usability.
* **Put users first:** You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad.
* **Not ideological about technology:** To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.
* **Empathetic communication:** You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.
* **Team player:** For you, work isn't a solo endeavor. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same.

### **Nice to Haves:**


* You have expertise with specific technologies that are part of our stack, including Typescript, React, Electron, Node.js, AWS, and Postgres.
* You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.
* You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences.

Our customers come from all walks of life and so do we. We hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it makes our company stronger. If you share our values and our enthusiasm for small businesses, you will find a home at Notion.
