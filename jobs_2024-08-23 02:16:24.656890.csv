**About Us:**



Competitive triathletes and passionate bakers, Pam Weekes and Connie McDonald left their careers to open a small bread shop in New York City in 1995 — Levain Bakery.  

One day, they baked a BIG chocolate chip walnut cookie as energy for triathlon training. At Levain, a batch of these 6-ounce cookies flew off the shelves, and an icon was born. The cozy shop on West 74th Street became a neighborhood favorite and a destination for epicurious visitors from around the world, hungry for “the cookie.”  


From the start, Pam, Connie and team baked everything fresh on-site each day, donating the day’s leftovers to charity — and we still do, nearly 30 years later. Today, Levain has bakeries across the country (with more to come!), plus ecommerce gift boxes to treat cookie lovers in every state.  


Every day, we strive to embody our company’s five core values:
* Welcome All- *we are all in it together*
* Work Hard and Be Nice- *we go above and beyond*
* Lead with Heart- *we do the right thing*
* Rise Up- *we are proactive*

New York State Gaming Commission Supervising Racing Veterinarian



Opportunities for Per Diem Supervising Racing Veterinarians at a rate of $459.82 per day are currently available at Yonkers Raceway, located at 810 Yonkers Ave, Yonkers, NY. Join our innovative regulatory team dedicated to assuring the highest integrity, credibility, and quality of horseracing. Commission veterinarians are unconditional advocates for equine health, welfare, and safety.



Job Description


* Responsible for all matters concerning the physical condition of horses to be raced at the track as to soundness and freedom from defect or contagious disease.
* In charge of enforcement of laws, rules and regulations forbidding use of certain drugs and stimulants.
* Assist in the conduct of investigations in event of positive drug tests and equine injuries or fatalities.
* Obtain blood samples and supervise the taking of urine samples and storage of all samples for testing.
* Supply technical information on drugs and their effects and acts as an expert witness at hearings.
* Assist in the determination of fitness of racing entrants and reports such as matters to the racing officials.



Minimum Qualifications



Candidates must have a degree in Veterinary Medicine and a current, valid New York State Veterinary License.



New York State residence is not required. However, you must be legally eligible to work in the United States at the time of appointment and throughout your employment with New York State. If appointed, you must produce documents that establish your identity and eligibility to work in the United States, as required by the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, and the Immigration and Nationality Act.



Additional Information



New York State is an Equal Opportunity Employer.



Appointment to this position in State government requires candidates to undergo an investigative screening. This includes a thorough character investigation, a Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal Record History Check including fingerprinting. The Commission will pay the fee for fingerprinting. All convictions must be disclosed. Depending on the nature of the job, the criminal convictions discovered, or any falsified or omitted information revealed, the investigative findings may bar appointment or result in removal after appointment. Each case is determined on its own merits, consistent with the applicable provisions of state and federal laws.


Reference Checks and Verification of Credentials: It is the Commission policy to verify credentials, education, and work experience for the position for which you are being considered. We will also conduct reference checks.



Prior Employment Restrictions: The law that established the Commission (Section 107 of New York’s Racing, Pari-Mutuel Wagering and Breeding Law) prohibits any person from being employed by the Commission if, during the period commencing three years prior to employment, such person held any interest in, or employment by, any corporation, association or person engaged in gaming activity with the State. However, Part BB of Chapter 59 of the Laws of 2019 enabled the Commission to waive for “good cause” the pre-employment restrictions for a prospective employee whose duties and responsibilities are primarily on racetrack grounds via a resolution that outlines the reasons for the waiver and that there are no other qualified candidates with the desired experience for the specific position.


Prohibition Against Playing and Wagering: Commission employees and family members residing in their households are prohibited from purchasing or claiming New York Lottery tickets or prizes and all Mega Millions and Powerball tickets or prizes. Commission employees are prohibited from wagering upon any horse racing, commercial gaming, Indian gaming and charitable gaming activities within the State or at out-of-state properties of a licensee. The prohibition against wagering upon any horse racing, commercial gaming, Indian gaming and charitable gaming activities within the State, however, does not apply to family members of Commission employees. Commission employees are all barred from playing any regulated Interactive Fantasy Sports and sports wagering. To avoid any appearance of impropriety of conflict of interest, Commission employees are prohibited from all aspects of promoting, operating, and playing in any charitable gambling.


Outside Activities and Employment: It is the obligation of every employee of the Commission to pursue a course of conduct that will not cause public concern as to whether such employee is engaged in activities in conflict with the public trust. It is vital that even the appearance of a conflict of interest be avoided in view of the critical nature of the Commission's responsibilities. In addition, employees should not use Commission equipment or supplies, or Commission time to pursue or engage in any such activities. All outside employment and volunteer activities must be approved by the Commission.



Post -Employment Restrictions: Post-employment restrictions apply to all State Officers and Employees subject to Public Officers Law Section 73. They apply to part-time and seasonal employees and apply equally regardless of the duration of employment while with New York State. For the two-year period immediately following separation from State service, former State Officers and Employees are prohibited from:


* Appearing or practicing, regardless of compensation, before their former agency, and
* Receiving compensation on behalf of a client in relation to a matter before their former agency



State Officers and Employees may also be subject to a “reverse two-year bar” that requires State officers and employees to recuse themselves from matters involving their former private sector employers for two years after entering State service.



The “lifetime bar” prohibits a former State Officer or Employee from providing services, regardless of compensation, and from rendering services for compensation, in relation to any case, proceeding, application or transaction with respect to which the former employee was directly concerned and in which he or she personally participated or which was under his or her active consideration while in State service.



How and Where to Apply



If you have any questions regarding this opportunity, please call Wendy Merton at 518-388-3400 and mention this position.
