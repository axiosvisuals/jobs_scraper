We're always on the lookout for talented individuals to join our team. If you're interested in a career with us, we encourage you to send us your resume and a brief introduction. **About the Companies:**


Elsewhere is a multi-room Brooklyn music venue and nightclub built by and for the culture-obsessed, managed by our sister promotions company PopGun Presents - an events collective with deep roots in NYC's emerging music community. We are here to empower artists, celebrate the diversity of our city, widen access to visionary and uplifting culture, and experience the joy of doing it all together.


If you share our passion for music and art without boundaries, and you're looking for the challenge of your career, we want to connect with you - join us and grow with one of the best teams in independent arts, hospitality, events, and culture.

 **You’ll love your time at Elsewhere because…**

* We believe in what we do, and foster a culture of respect (for all music & people), passion, and excellence
* You will work with teammates that are the best in the culture & events business
* You will be on the cutting edge of music, enabling emerging culture to thrive




* We are building a long-term business, that can support long-term careers in our industry

 **Elsewhere’s Values**

These values are real and guide all of our decisions in how we operate and how we treat people. This includes our decisions to hire, reward, and fire. Every single person at Elsewhere will be held to these standards. This is how we build a great team, achieve our goals, and do so enjoyably.

**INCLUSIVITY**


Elsewhere is a haven for our staff, artists, and audiences to experience the joy of expressing their authentic selves. Everybody has the right to feel welcomed and understood here, in direct defiance of all the ways our society tries to divide us up out there. We crave connectivity and togetherness. We’re curious about the unknown.

**OPTIMISM**


The chills we get experiencing transcendent music in a crowd remind us that a better world is possible. Elsewhere is a celebration of that feeling - of joy, wonder, and hope. We are here to have fun, and we reject cynicism in all its forms.

**RESPECT**


Our love for the game comes from a place of deep respect: for the extraordinary history of music and nightlife in NYC, for the working artists out there redefining culture, and for our staff who live and breathe it every night. To do right, we extend that respect to each other and everyone else along the journey.

**KINDNESS**


Our job means service: to our teammates, artists, customers, community, city, and to the culture. We can’t do this without being kind to ourselves, to each other, to our artists, to our audiences, and to our community. Be understanding, empathetic, go out of your way to help people out, be friendly, generous, considerate. We celebrate individuality, but there is no place for selfishness or ego.


**INTEGRITY**


We believe strong communities are built on trust, and so everyone must rely on us to be honest, transparent, and consistent. We live our values and stand by them even when it’s hard or inconvenient. We admit our mistakes and work to grow from them.

**PASSION**


There are much easier ways to earn a living. The renewable resource that keeps our team sustained is an unshakable conviction in some aspect of our mission, whether it’s supporting new artists, helping audiences discover music, building community, or shifting culture.

**EXCELLENCE**


To accomplish our goals we aim high, and work both hard and smart.

**CREATIVITY**


The beauty of culture is that it is always evolving, and so should we. We value out-of- the-box thinking, challenging “the way things are,” and imaginative leaps. Like in art, it is better for us to fail trying something new than to not be experimenting in the first place.
