We are seeking a motivated sales consultant interested in a long-term career with our company. We specialize in high end, multifunctional furniture imported from Italy and Germany - this includes wall beds, sofa beds, dining tables, wardrobes, and so forth.

Milano Smart Living opened in 2012 and has expanded multiple times, most recently moving to the ground floor of the New York Design Center in 2021.

As a sales consultant you will deal with high end clientele including architects, designers, trade, and public.

One of the most important roles of this position is to be able to demonstrate our products when greeting clients – this includes opening and closing sofa beds, wall beds, and dining tables daily.

We are not a “hard sale” company – you will be expected to follow up with clients by providing spec sheets and information by email, but the beauty of our product is that it sells itself if shown to potential clients properly.

Sales are processed through QuickBooks (if you’re not familiar with this program we will teach you). We work with SketchUp for floorplans, layouts, and 3d renders. Ideally, we’d like you to learn SketchUp as it’s a great selling tool which allows clients to visualize their projects (again, if you’re not familiar with this program, we will teach you).

Any knowledge in SketchUp, AutoCAD, and Photoshop are preferred but not necessary.
