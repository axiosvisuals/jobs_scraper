-----------------------


Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.  

  

So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.  

  

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.**Job Description**

The Community team at OpenAI is dedicated to building relationships with early adopters—individuals who are pioneering and shaping compelling use cases for our technologies. We showcase these early adopters’ use cases and insights for their broader communities to learn from. We focus on four distinct cohorts: visual creatives (film, animation, illustration), writers, educators, and internet creators.

**About the Role**


As our first Community Manager for Higher Education, you will focus on architecting how OpenAI builds relationships with and empowers educators—to start, professors, associate professors, and other academic professionals—who are early adopters of AI tools in their classrooms. Your mission is to find the important members of this community, learn from their AI applications, and help amplify their stories and use cases so millions more educators can learn from them.


OpenAI is a very special company. We’re governed by a nonprofit, and people come to work here because they think developing and deploying AI safely is the most important work to be done in our lifetime. Community Managers are a part of a team that is focused on building relationships with creatives and educators whose work will be transformed by this technology, and doing all that we can to empower them.


The purpose of community building is different here. We’re not focused on followers or ROI. Conversations about our technology are dictated by the first people, often individuals, to share use cases and impressions. We’re focused on finding the people who are developing pioneering applications of AI and then showcasing their insights to the larger community.
  

We’re looking for someone who can build sincere and trusting relationships with these special educators, while also realizing a variety of well-executed projects (stories, events, test groups) in service of them.


This role is based in New York, NY or San Francisco, CA. We offer relocation assistance to new employees.

**In this role, you will:**

* Own and manage building a community of early and important adopters in higher education. This will include understanding that community, finding exceptional community members, doing outreach with them, and highlighting their insights for using our products.
* Draft blog posts, social posts, and more about members of this cohort. On occasion, collaborate with our internal video and events team to produce ambitious moments.
* Translate complicated technological advances to different audiences with a variety of technical backgrounds, ranging from someone who has just discovered ChatGPT to audiences of Computer Science professors who are experts.
* Develop and manage an early access community—a special set of early adopters in education who we trust to try our technologies first and shape applications for others.
* Collaborate cross-functionally to drive, build and maintain systems that allow OpenAI teams to learn from this community’s use cases and insights.

**You might thrive in this role if you:**

* Have experience in scaled community building, preferably in a scrappy startup environment.
* Enjoy hunting for interesting outliers online. Have the ability to quickly build warm, trusting relationships with new people over email, zoom, and beyond.
* Have **exceptional** verbal and written communication skills. Can turn your educator use cases into clear and engaging stories.
* Are confident creating briefs for seasoned creative partners, such as video and events specialists, and helping them realize work that honors members of a community.
* Are curious about new developments in AI and how they are transforming education.
* Thrive in a collaborative environment and enjoy working across teams and departments with colleagues from different backgrounds and areas of expertise.
* Are comfortable working in a fast-paced environment and can adapt to changing priorities and technologies. You are resourceful and can find creative solutions to challenges.
* Believe in the importance of transparency and authenticity in communication.

**T**he New Museum's mission is simply ""New Art, New Ideas."" Founded in 1977 by curator Marcia Tucker with a bold vision of presenting contemporary culture in a critical and scholarly context, the New Museum has been a leader among contemporary art museums for over 40 years and is among the most respected internationally for its risk-taking curatorial program. The New Museum is a center for exhibitions, information, and documentation about living artists from around the world, focusing on emerging and under-recognized voices, and providing a platform for the artists who are defining our cultural moment. In 2007, the New Museum made history with the inauguration of its first permanent building at 235 Bowery designed by the Tokyo-based firm SANAA. Since opening in its new location, over 4 million have visited or attended programs and events, and the Museum has 155 exhibitions featuring over 600 artists from 60+ countries in our galleries, as well as over 1,200 public programs ranging from live performances, conferences, residencies, screening, after-school programs, and family days.

With a current staff of approximately 145 people and an annual budget of $13.4M, the museum is preparing for the start of construction of a new building adjacent to the current site. The new seven-story, 60,000 square foot building will include three floors of galleries, doubling the Museum’s exhibition space, along with additional space for the Museum’s many community and education programs, a permanent home for its cultural incubator NEW INC, as well as increased public amenities and improved vertical circulation.

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/U--haul","http://www.uhaul.com/","2727 North Central Avenue

A 2-3 year Research Technician position is available in the laboratory of Vanessa Ruta at the Rockefeller University in New York City. The Ruta Lab applies a broad multidisciplinary approach to examine odor detection and perception in insects, from the molecular basis for odorant detection to the behavioral algorithms underlying olfactory plume navigation. One focus of the lab is on the molecular basis of odorant signaling in insect olfactory receptors, using membrane protein biochemistry, cryo-EM structure determination, electrophysiology and other functional assays to reveal insight into how this large and highly divergent family of ion channels can recognize the vast chemical world.
Ongoing work, funded by generous support from HHMI, NIAID, and the Gates Foundation is revealing broader principles of how odors are recognized, by determining the structures of receptors bound by different odorants and exploring the underlying structural basis for their chemical tuning through rational interrogation of structure/function relationships at the molecular level. Unraveling the molecular basis for odorant recognition and signal transduction in insect odorant receptors (ORs), an evolutionary innovation of insects, lays the groundwork for the rational design of novel classes of insect repellents to control human disease vectors, and to engineer synthetic diagnostic “noses” to detect human disease-associated volatile compounds. More information about the lab can be found on this website.
About the Research Technician role:
The Laboratory of Neurophysiology and Behavior is seeking a research assistant that will work as part of a small and experienced team to carry out structure-function studies of olfactory receptors. The work will include membrane protein biochemistry (expression, purification, and analysis), *in vivo* and *in vitro* functional assays (cell-based Ca2+ imaging, cellular and in vivo electrophysiology, reconstituted liposome systems) and structural characterization (single-particle cryo-EM structure determination, model building, *in silico* molecular docking and dynamics). Ideal candidates will be motivated to learn and contribute experimentally and conceptually exhibit a strong drive to organize, document, interpret, and communicate results, have a passion for scientific discovery and advancement, and a strong commitment to learning and growing professionally within the lab for at least 2 years before moving on to their next opportunity.
What we provide:* A competitive compensation package with comprehensive health and wellness benefits
* Training and further skill building around various biochemistry and molecular biology techniques.
* Strong potential for contribution to research publications.
* Working closely with and being mentored by a senior member of the Ruta lab team.
* Opportunity to present lab data.


What you’ll do:* Perform functional and structural characterization of receptors to explore odorant tuning.
* Employ a variety of techniques including: molecular cloning, mammalian and insect tissue culture, baculovirus production, cell transfection and infection, affinity purification, fluorescence-detection size-exclusion chromatography, cell-based functional assays, electrophysiology cryo-electron microscopy and computational docking.
* Work independently to design, perform, and analyze experiments.
* Actively contribute to research projects, including supporting experiments and presentation of data in laboratory meetings.
* Perform lab maintenance duties as needed.
* Participate in weekly laboratory meetings and planning sessions.


What you bring:* A Bachelor's degree (or higher) in biochemistry, chemistry or a closely related field.
* Experience in molecular biology techniques such as PCR and cloning.
* Experience with tissue culture and cell transfection.
* Experience in biochemistry techniques such as affinity purification and/or cryoEM would be a plus.
* Excellent organizational, communication and time management skills.
* An excellent self-starting attitude with strong capability to bring innovative ideas and solutions to complex problems.
* Eagerness to grow professionally, learn new techniques, and be mentored.
* Able to eventually work independently after an initial period of training.

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/U--haul","http://www.uhaul.com/","2727 North Central Avenue
