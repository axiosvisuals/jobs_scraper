The NYC Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) enriches the environment and protects public health for all New Yorkers by providing 1.1 billion gallons of high-quality drinking water, managing wastewater and stormwater, and reducing air, noise, and hazardous materials pollution. DEP is the largest combined municipal water and wastewater utility in the country, with nearly 6,000 employees. DEP's water supply system is comprised of 19 reservoirs and 3 controlled lakes throughout the system’s 2,000 square mile watershed that extends 125 miles north and west of the City.

-------------------


Established in 1805, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (the NYC Health Department) is the oldest and largest health department in the country. Our mission is to protect and improve the health of all New Yorkers, in service of a vision of a city in which all New Yorkers can realize their full health potential, regardless of who they are, how old they are, where they are from, or where they live.
  

  

As a world-renowned public health agency with a history of building transformative public health programming and infrastructure, innovating in science and scholarship to advance public health knowledge, and responding to urgent public health crises from New York City’s yellow fever outbreak in 1822, to the COVID-19 pandemic we are a hub for public health innovation, expertise, and programs, and services. We serve as the population health strategist, and policy, and planning authority for the City of New York, while also having a vast impact on national and international public policy, including programs and services focused on food and nutrition, anti-tobacco support, chronic disease prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, family and child health, environmental health, mental health, and racial and social justice work, among others.
  

  

Our Agency’s five strategic priorities, building off a recently-completed strategic planning process emerging from the COVID-19 emergency, are:
  

1) To re-envision how the Health Department prepares for and responds to health emergencies, with a focus on building a “response-ready” organization, with faster decision-making, transparent public communications, and stronger surveillance and bridges to healthcare systems 2) Address and prevent chronic and diet-related disease, including addressing rising rates of childhood obesity and the impact of diabetes, and transforming our food systems to improve nutrition and enhance access to healthy foods
  

3) Address the second pandemic of mental illness including: reducing overdose deaths, strengthening our youth mental health systems, and supporting people with serious mental illness
  

4) Reduce black maternal mortality and make New York a model city for women’s health
  

5) Mobilize against and combat the health impacts of climate change
  

  

Our 7,000-plus team members bring extraordinary diversity to the work of public health. True to our value of equity as a foundational element of all of our work, and a critical foundation to achieving population health impact in New York City, the NYC Health Department has been a leader in recognizing and dismantling racism’s impacts on the health of New Yorkers and beyond. In 2021, the NYC Board of Health declared racism as a public health crisis. With commitment to advance anti-racist public health practices that dismantle systems that perpetuate inequitable power, opportunity and access, the NYC Health Department continues to work in and with communities and community organizations to increase their access to health services and decrease avoidable health outcomes.

You'll notice we did not list specific skills. That's because the ""stuff"" that matters, the passion, the quantitative mindset, the ability to be a good teammate but also operate independently - these are what we are evaluating you on. We seek innovators who can add to our culture, contribute to our growth, and strive for excellence.

**Experience**

* Enrolled in bachelors or masters program. We love folks with varied coursework, but you must possess an analytical mindset, passion for business, and a desire to innovate. Risk Management & Insurance majors, a plus.
* A history of tackling projects with a quantitative lens, and a desire for data-driven insights.
* Verisk serves the insurance vertical so an interest or past experience in insurance is helpful, though not required.
* Technical skill requirements vary depending on the position. Be sure to include your technical skillset on your resume, and we can go from there. At a minimum, you should have Microsoft excel as a foundation.

***The Internship Program is not eligible for work visa sponsorship. If you will require work visa sponsorship (e.g., H1-B visa)” after completing your degree, you do not meet the basic requirements of the summer intern role.***

 **Recruitment Process:**


We want to get to know YOU. Once you apply, our team will review your application. Successful candidates will be invited to a two-stage interview process including:

* **Online Assessment:** Our team is eager to get to know you better. During this session, you’ll be introduced to several of our team leaders who will ask you a series of prerecorded questions to understand what motivates you and where your interests lie. This is your chance to make yourself stand out from the pack. Additionally, you will complete a short Excel test to assess your proficiency with basic Excel functionalities.
* **Final Live Virtual Interview:** This round is to determine if Verisk’s culture is right for you. You'll have the opportunity to speak with several members of our business recruitment committee.
* **Offer:** Our committee will meet and discuss your candidacy. Should you be extended an offer, we will advise you of the specific role and location where your internship will take place.
