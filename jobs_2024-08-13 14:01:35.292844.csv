**POSITION SUMMARY**

  



Our jobs aren’t just about giving guests a smooth check-in and check-out. Instead, we want to build and experience that is memorable and unique. Our Guest Experience Specialists take the initiative to deliver a wide range of services that guide guests through their entire stay. Their role goes beyond the traditional front desk to take ownership of the guest experience in the main areas of the hotel with a “guest first” mindset. They are empowered to move about their space and do what needs to be done. Whether processing operational needs, addressing guest requests, completing reports, delivering quality meals, or sharing the highlights of the local area, the Guest Experience Specialist makes transactions feel like part of the experience.

  



No matter what position you are in, there are a few things that are critical to success – creating a safe work place, following company policies and procedures, maintaining confidentiality, protecting company assets, upholding quality standards, and ensuring your uniform, personal appearance, and communications are professional. Guest Experience Specialists will be on their feet and moving around (stand, sit, or walk for an extended time) and taking a hands-on approach to work (move, lift, carry, push, pull, and place objects weighing less than or equal to 25 pounds without assistance; reach overhead and below the knees, including bending, twisting, pulling, and stooping). Doing all these things well (and other reasonable job duties as requested) is critical for Guest Experience Specialists – to get it right for our guests and our business each and every time.

The world of work is changing…short commutes, flexibility, and convenience are the minimum standards employees want when it comes to how they want to work!



At IWG, we are leading the way. We’ve built the world’s largest workspace network so that our customers can work from wherever, and however, they want… in over 120 countries across the globe!



Join us and help us bring more freedom to people and businesses, while expanding our network. You’ll be able to enjoy a great work life balance and competitive benefits, while growing your career path along the way.

  


**The opportunity**



As a Community Associate, you’ll work closely with new and existing customers across a myriad of industries, working to create and maintain your own community within your center, where you will help take care of all the administrative and support needs for your customers…so that your customers can focus on running their business.

  


**A typical day at IWG**

You arrive a few minutes before your center opens to make sure everything is ready and check there’s nothing the cleaners have missed.



Customers arrive all throughout the morning. One asks you for a changed WiFi code. Another wants to know if his important package has arrived. A woman needs directions to her meeting room… and can you help her set up the projector and show her where to find a great cup of coffee. You’re off to help her get set-up, as soon as you connect the incoming call to another customer. You may sure that all of the services are properly charged, so that invoices are accurate.



It’s time for a quick coffee break, relax and enjoy a few minutes to yourself.



The mail arrives. You sort through it while dealing with a whole host of other customer requests, remembering to email the customer from earlier to let him know his package is waiting for him in his mailbox. And that’s lunch.



A new wave of customers arrive throughout the afternoon. You help a customer with printing and another with their invoice. A customer in a team room say it’s too hot in their office, no problem you are on it and open a ticket in our service portal.



You’ve earned yourself another quick coffee break, relax and enjoy a few minutes to yourself.



Early afternoon, you sit down with the Community Manager to discuss the organization of next week’s networking event in your center. You plan and write the e-invites to customers, then create, print and put-up posters on the noticeboards around the center. To your excitement, the Community Manager is coming around the corner with a prospect (someone interested in joining the IWG community), you share a few details about what makes this space so amazing for your customers and encourage them to join the network soon so they can participate in next week’s networking event – then you head back to finish putting up your posters.



The day is coming to a close. Time to gently ask the large group in meeting room 3 to start wrapping up. You direct them to the nice restaurant you know around the corner, so they can grab a bite and continue their discussion. You ensure everything’s nice and tidy, it’s time to head home.

  



**About you**



We’re looking for someone who knows how to manage multiple tasks while providing customers with the best possible service. You also need to be:


* A good communicator, with the ability to build strong professional relationships and empathize with people’s needs (Ideally 1+ years of customer service experience)
* Happy taking ownership of problems and finding ways to solve them
* Positive, enthusiastic, and able to adapt to fast-changing situations
* Experience and confidence using MS Office and other basic IT equipment
* Legally eligible to work in the Country you are applying within and at least 18 years old

  



**What we offer**



On top of a competitive total compensation package, you’ll enjoy:


* Work life balance (no standard nights/weekends)
* Generous paid time off plans (sick and vacation)
* 11 Paid Company Holidays per calendar year (in addition to your PTO accrual)
* Competitive 401K Program, with a Company match
* Affordable and comprehensive health care for all full-time team members (and some plan options for part-timers as well)
* A quarterly bonus plan program, plus an hourly rate of $19.62
* A bright and inspiring work environment

* A professional workplace community (business casual attire required)

### **About Meta:**


Meta builds technologies that help people connect, find communities, and grow businesses. When Facebook launched in 2004, it changed the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world. Now, Meta is moving beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality to help build the next evolution in social technology. People who choose to build their careers by building with us at Meta help shape a future that will take us beyond what digital connection makes possible today—beyond the constraints of screens, the limits of distance, and even the rules of physics.
