About HPD:  

  

The New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) is the nationâs largest municipal housing preservation and development agency. Its mission is to promote quality and affordability in the city's housing, and diversity and strength in the cityâs neighborhoods because every New Yorker deserves a safe, affordable place to live in a neighborhood they love.
  

HPD is entrusted with fulfilling these objectives through the goals and strategies of Housing Our Neighbors: A Blueprint for Housing and Homelessness, Mayor Adamsâ comprehensive housing framework. HPD is committed to reducing administrative and regulatory barriers and make investments to tackle New York Cityâs complex housing crisis, by addressing homelessness and housing instability, promoting economic stability and mobility, increasing homeownership opportunities, improving health and safety, and increasing opportunities for equitable growth.  

  

Your Team:  

  

The Office of Housing Access and Stability (âHASâ) consists of the divisions of Housing Opportunity, Tenant and Owner Resources, Housing Stability, Budget and Program Operations, and Program Policy and Innovation. The mission of the office is to ensure fair, efficient, and transparent access to affordable housing. The Office provides subsidies, placement services, and tools that connect New Yorkers to affordable housing and ensures vulnerable households in subsidized housing have the support they need to be safely housed. Housing Access is committed to expanding housing choices, affirmatively furthering fair housing, and stabilizing the financial health of buildings.
  

  

At HPD, rent subsidy programs are administered by the Division of Tenant & Owner Resources (DTOR). HPDâs rental subsidies, including Section 8 or the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program, provide funding to eligible low-income families for rental assistance toward decent, safe, and affordable housing in a neighborhood of their choice. Families pay approximately 30% of their income toward rent, and the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) pays the difference, directly to the owner. The unit must have a rent that is determined reasonable and affordable by HPD and must meet federal Housing Quality Standards (HQS) to be approved.

Through these programs, HPD serves over 40,000 households and 9,000 landlords in all five boroughs. DTOR is responsible for the initial application screening; confirming eligibility requirements; briefing applicants; and issuing vouchers. DTOR also monitors tenant and landlord compliance of their obligations under each program and continues to administer the ongoing subsidies throughout their participation.

Under the direction of the Director, with latitude for independent judgement, initiative and decision making, the Deputy Director will develop and implement strategies to enhance operations, improve productivity and staff development.  

  

The Deputy Director will establish and maintain effective working relationships among staff, clients and the general public. They will ensure operational effectiveness and compliance with policies and procedures. The Deputy Director will facilitate the process of submitting applications to HPDâs rent subsidy programs with other departments and outside agencies.

HRA is dedicated to fighting poverty and income inequality by providing New Yorkers in need with essential benefits such as Food Assistance and Emergency Rental Assistance. DHS is committed to preventing and addressing homelessness in New York City by employing a variety of innovative strategies to help families and individuals successfully exit shelter and return to self-sufficiency as quickly as possible.  

  

Information Technology Services (ITS) is DSSâs technology services organization. Its mission is to support the daily, emergent, and long-term needs of both agencies. ITS creates and enhances the technology infrastructure and computer applications that support HRA and DHS and develops applications, including a variety of client eligibility and recertification systems, case management systems, housing systems, employment/work engagement services, revenue producing computer matches, claiming systems, and personnel systems.

and monthly benefit issuance programs, which issue more than 350 million each month in

produce benefit issuance files for Income Maintenance and Food Stamp cases) and the
  

IBM systems (Which processes the benefit issuance files created in both). This is
  

accomplished through editing, check printing and production and delivery of a tape file to
  

a vendor for electronic benefit issuance) (EPFT). The benefit issuance posting, and
  

reconciliation runs (from computer files received from banks and the EPFT vendor)
  

similarly must be coordinated through both the IBM and UNISYS systems. (Since runs
  

which take a long time to process, must be fully completed each night prior to the next
  

night's run and must occur five days each week, processing time is very tight and much -
  

coordination is necessary).
  

  

* Coordinate production processing for Medicaid benefits to ensure that files from both

the UNISYS and IBM systems are created correctly and on schedule and are processed
  

through the IBM systems to the Albany, New York Medicaid systems for issuance of
  

Medicaid cards and payment of Medicaid bills.
  

  

* Monitor computer performance to ensure that procedures for run set-up and verification

are followed and that production output on the IBM, Prime, Datapoint and Unix based
  

Personal Computer systems meets high quality standards. Review, on an audit basis,
  

run sheets and print control forms to ensure proper completion both at set-up and quality
  

review stages.
  

  

* Perform reasonableness tests and reviews JES2 logs prior to the printing of negotiable

documents to ensure that each run is correct and that the proper number of negotiable
  

documents with the proper dollar values and correct check date will be printed.
  

Verify negotiable documents after printing to insure correctness.
  

  

* Ensure that the Production Control records and logbooks for each system are maintained

and are current, complete, and accurate.
  

  

* Ensure that problem reports are prepared for each problem encountered, that problems

are promptly researched and resolved, and that steps are taken to prevent the problem
  

from reoccurring.  

  

* Contact as required, Technical Services, Production Services, System Development and

other MIS staff and user staff day or night to assist in correcting problems which need
  

their expertise to resolve.  

  

* Review automated daily schedules for the IBM system and ensures that jobs are run on

schedule. Make decisions to adjust schedules to meet deadlines when problems occur.
  

Determine, when necessary, the priority of jobs to be run when there are limited computer
  

resources available. Coordinate scheduling changes on the UNISYS systems with those
  

required on the IBM systems.
