**Organizational Overview:**



IAVI is a nonprofit scientific research organization dedicated to addressing urgent, unmet global health challenges including HIV and tuberculosis. Our mission is to translate scientific discoveries into affordable, globally accessible public health solutions. Through scientific and clinical research in Africa, India, Europe, and the U.S., IAVI is pioneering the development of biomedical innovations designed for broad global access. We develop vaccines and antibodies in and for the developing world and seek to accelerate their introduction in low-income countries. IAVI programs and partnerships are grounded in the regions of the world where the disease burden is the greatest, and our approach emphasizes sustainability. Our network of clinical research center partners in Africa and India helps strengthen in-country research capacity and supports the training and education of the next generation of scientists. The global impact of our science includes fundamental contributions to understanding the biology of HIV infection, which IAVI and others are applying toward advancing vaccine science and immunology. IAVI accelerates scientific discovery and development by fostering unique collaborations among academia, industry, local communities, governments, and funders to explore new and better ways to address public health threats that disproportionately affect people living in poverty. Our global reach, including a clinical research network in five countries in sub-Saharan Africa and in India, has allowed us to make fundamental contributions to understanding the epidemiology, transmission, virology, and immunology of HIV. This work played a key role in facilitating the design of promising HIV vaccine candidates, as well as the discovery of broadly neutralizing antibodies that are now being advanced as promising approaches for HIV prevention. Our integrated capabilities in vaccine and antibody discovery, development, and clinical research take advantage of bio-pharmaceutical industry expertise to accelerate the development and testing of prevention methods for HIV and other diseases. Through the Product Development Center, we support external researchers with technical and scientific expertise to accelerate the development of their own products.


**IAVI CORE VALUES:**


* Dedication to the Mission: We are committed to the translation of scientific discoveries into affordable, globally accessible public health solutions.
* Innovative Evolution: We are committed to solving complex problems in creative and innovative ways, learning from our mistakes and successes and never giving up
* Integrity: We are committed to meeting the highest ethical and professional standards in everything we do and to taking responsibility for our actions to earn respect
* Collaboration: We are committed to embracing diversity, the power of global teamwork and the belief that by working as one we can make a difference

**Postdoctoral position in cancer-neuroscience**The Trotman Lab at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory is seeking applications for postdoctoral candidates with a strong background in neurobiology. We study lethal metastatic cancer. The project aims to define how peripheral nerves in the metastatic tumor environment interact with cancer cells and affect progression, therapy and disease outcome.

The team uses a genetically engineered model of metastatic prostate cancer in a native, immune competent environment (see PMIDs: 24444712, 25829425 and 31092557). Recently, they developed whole organ 3D imaging at single cell resolution of the disease (PMID 34788609). This now allows them to map and functionally probe the neuro-metastatic interface (reviewed in 32302564). The work is a close collaboration with the Borniger Lab at CSHL studying brain body communication in cancer (see PMID 31174326).

**Position Requirements**

The successful candidate will have a PhD in Neuroscience, and extensive expertise with in vivo techniques for functional neurobiology, such as optogenetics, stereotaxic viral injections, calcium imaging etc. Candidates are expected to be great at communicating principles of neurobiology and innovative at problem solving in order to apply the above techniques to functional probing of peripheral nerve interaction with metastatic cancer in various organs.

They should thrive in a mixed environment that brings together CSHL’s cutting edge cancer and neuroscientists. Opportunities for translational studies with clinician collaborators are also available.

**How to Apply:**  
For immediate consideration, please complete the online application found here: Postdoctoral Fellow- Trotman Lab Position ID 00607

**Supplemental Information**

**Environment**  
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory is a world-renowned biomedical research institution in New York. It has shaped contemporary biomedical research and is the home of eight Nobel Prize laureates.

You’ll combine skills in behavioral research design, statistical methods, and general programming to improve user experience.  

  

The Quantitative UXR community at Google will help you do your best work. You’ll have the opportunity to work with and learn from UXRs across Google through regular meetups, mentor programs, and access to internal research tools.

With an annual budget of $2.3 billion and more than 7,000 employees throughout the five boroughs, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH) is one of the largest public health agencies in the world, serving 8 million New Yorkers from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds. We're tackling a broad range of public health issues with innovative policies and programs and getting exceptional results, but our work is never finished. The breadth of our innovative programs provides the widest range of choices for every member of our team.
With grant funds from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), DOHMH is undertaking a new initiative that will meet critical infrastructure needs and make possible strategic investments that will have lasting effects on public health. Investments and improvements through this initiative will help modernize DOHMH’s foundational capabilities and data infrastructure, enabling it to partner in complex health and health care environments and, in turn, support better public health outcomes, including COVID-19. This initiative supports larger efforts to rebalance investments in public health and more equitably serve communities and populations.


The selected candidate will be an employee of Public Health Solutions, a nonprofit organization which is the fiscal and administrative manager of the grant but will work be supervised by DOHMH. **This is a grant-funded position ending in November 2027.**


The Center for Health Equity & Community Wellness (CHECW) seeks to eliminate racial and other inequities resulting in premature mortality. With an unwavering grounding in history and structural analysis, CHECW works to increase visibility of the harm perpetuated by centuries of racist, socially unjust policy while pushing towards redress for the most impacted NYC communities. CHECW addresses inequity across community and healthcare systems in partnership with community, faith-based, and health care organizations. CHECW’s work focuses on social determinants of health, including environmental and commercial determinants, and addresses both upstream and downstream factors to improve health and well-being of New Yorkers.

Cross County Savings Bank is a local, FDIC-insured mutual savings bank that was originally founded in 1888.

===============



Tetra is leading the clean energy transformation by adding transparency and efficiency into a forgotten industry. Most homeowners are unaware they can reduce carbon emissions and lower their utility bills because home improvement contractors lack the automation and technology to easily share information and reach new customers. Homeowners are left in the dark to navigate a painful and confusing buying process.



Tetra provides the most efficient and affordable options to homeowners, improves their experience through a consultative approach, and coordinates the installation of home improvement projects. In doing so, we're ""super powering"" contractors by automating admin tasks and allowing them to focus on installation excellence and customer happiness.



We're starting by transforming heating and cooling replacements for property owners, a $120 billion industry which makes up 12% of total energy usage in the US. Federal and state governments allocate billions of dollars in incentives to help homeowners choose high-efficiency systems—now at unprecedented levels thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022—but the dollars are historically underutilized due to lack of customer awareness. We're democratizing and unlocking those incentive dollars starting in our home state of Massachusetts, and soon expanding to many new markets.


**About the job**



With our significant early traction and Seed round co-led by Lerer Hippeau, Gutter Capital, Greycroft, and an angel syndicate of industry and startup gurus, Tetra is looking to add to our Homeowner Success team. This individual will advocate for homeowners to upgrade old heating and cooling systems (boilers, furnaces, air conditioners, mini splits, and water heaters) to save on their utility bills and reduce their carbon footprint.



Our 16-person team is mostly based near Boston, MA but we're distributed across 4 states and work remotely. This role reports to Tetra's Sales Manager.



Compensation: $120K OTE


**What you will do**


* Consult property owners through the technical details of buying an installation / replacement over the phone without an in-person sales visit
* Close new business and meet quarterly and annual sales goals via inbound inside sales (no outbound outreach, no cold-calling) with qualified leads provided by our SDRs, SEO, SEM, and Mass Save partnerships
* Clearly articulate and embody the Tetra value proposition for homeowners so they understand how we make the installation faster, easier, and lower cost
* Serve on the frontline of our new market growth so we can expand into other states


**Experience we are looking for**


* 2+ years of experience in a sales role
* Consistent track record of meeting or exceeding a sales quota
* Ability to handle objections and demonstrate value for a complex service
* Interest in the energy efficiency, home services industries, and/or technology industries
* Experience working in residential/commercial property services, construction, and/or business development in a related industry
* Previous experience in HVAC or the plumbing industry (preferred)
* Adaptability in a fast-paced, dynamic environment
* Self-starter with an ownership mentality who is able to deliver results, believes in continuous improvement and values customer satisfaction
  


**Diverse perspectives**



We know that innovation thrives on product teams where diverse points of view come together to solve hard problems. We seek people that bring diverse life experiences, educational backgrounds, cultures, and work experiences.



We are an Equal Opportunity Employer and do not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, color, sex, age, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, status as a veteran, and basis of disability or any other federal, state or local protected class.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Tetra","http://www.tetra-fish.com/","Melle, Germany","","","","","","",""
