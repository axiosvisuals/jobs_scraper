***Social Work Services at the Mount Sinai Hospital***  

  

The Mount Sinai Hospital is a 1,134-bed facility with an extensive outpatient and specialty care network and is the largest hospital in the Mount Sinai Health Care System. It offers comprehensive social work services and programming to meet the myriad needs of the diverse populations we serve. We believe that total patient care must emphasize the physical, emotional, and social needs of each patient and their care partners. Social Workers collaborate within interprofessional teams to serve patients and the larger community from both a micro and macro level including both direct care and prevention. Founded in 1907, the Department of Social Work Services at the Mount Sinai Hospital is one of the oldest hospital social work departments in the nation with over 450 licensed social workers employed across more than 65 different program/service areas. Employment in our department provides a pathway to LCSW licensure as well as access to a broad range of continuing education, professional development and extra-curricular opportunities.

  



These positions are in the World Trade Center Health Program (WTCHP), which provides medical and mental health monitoring and treatment to rescue, recovery, and clean-up workers who responded to Ground Zero following 9/11. Many of these workers are diagnosed with World Trade Center (WTC)-related physical and mental health conditions. Social Workers in the WTCHP are responsible for providing clinical services to responders seen at the WTCHP for monitoring and treatment.

 **Responsibilities**  

The responsibilities of the social worker in this position include, but are not limited to:

* Conducting mental health interviews with responders during their annual monitoring visits.
* Identifying patient need for referrals for WTCHP mental health intake.
* Providing crisis intervention to patients.
* Identifying patient need for social services, providing and referring to social work case management as appropriate.
* Offering information and immediate referral for patients with urgent resource-related needs (e.g., food pantry).
* Providing information about WTC-related benefits, including workers’ compensation and Victim’s Compensation.
* Actively collaborating with interdisciplinary team members around patient care needs and issues.
* Maintaining timely and clear documentation of patient contacts and visits in multiple systems.
* Participating in intake conferences and general staff meetings.

 ***These positions will require the ability to work primarily onsite at the MSH campus and will also require the ability to work remotely with access to basic technological equipment (e.g., computer with webcam, high-speed internet, and reliable cellphone service in space established for work) and a private area in which confidential work can be done. The ability to work full time at the MSH campus and evening/weekend hours may be required.***
