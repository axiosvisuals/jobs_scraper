Created for a new generation of urban travelers, Freehand combines the social culture of a hotel with innovative design by Roman and Williams, comfort and quality food and beverage at an affordable price.

**WHO ARE WE**


Freehand is on a journey. Appropriate, given that we're a shared accommodation brand. Freehand swung through the US coolest cities on its way to dominating the world.

Created for a new generation of urban travelers, Freehand combines the social culture of a hotel with innovative design by Roman and Williams, comfort and quality food and beverage at an affordable price.

Cultural action, creative pulse and an outstanding way to waste some of the finite time the universe has given you - that's what Freehand offers. Holds true for staff and visitors equally, and while chic design is always the backdrop, every Freehand in every destination reflects the unique beat of that city's heart.
