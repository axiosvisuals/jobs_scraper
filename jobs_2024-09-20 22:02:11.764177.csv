We provide strategic direct marketing solutions for national brands, leveraging innovative variable data technology, to turn concepts into finished digital and physical products, all in one seamless process.  



Have an eye for design and a strong, conceptual brain behind it? If so, then you’ve come to the right post! At Wilen, we’re currently looking for our next superstar who can deliver creative that checks all the boxes—strategy, concept, design and ultimately the client’s end goal: response.  



But what about us? Wilen is not your typical Long Island agency. We’re a full-service direct marketing shop, focusing primarily on mail but also developing creative across all marketing channels. Our clientele consists of national brands, and we create content in all forms—from straight, strategic assignments to more typical direct marketing efforts like print, digital, social and broadcast. As a conceptual agency that also manufactures the work, we’re in a unique position. We’re looking for a designer who has great creative ideas and can also think about fresh ways of producing them.  



Put simply, this is Madison Avenue work minus the Manhattan commute. And because our clients are some of the biggest in their industries, the Design has to be sharp. Fresh, well-designed layouts are paramount, but nothing makes us happier than an out‑of‑the-box, unexpected concept in the mix. Assignments often incorporate multiple channels, so being able to design a letter is just as important as being able to translate it into a great looking social post or display ad that generates response.  



Our creative team is all about collaboration. We play well with other departments and also rely on each other to help meet deadlines and go home on time. “You have two assignments due, and I’m slow today ... how can I help?” That’s how we roll. No drama, no egos, just (as corny as it sounds) a family-like team that gets great work done on time and has some fun and laughs while doing it. If this sounds like a place you’d like to work, then we’d like to meet you!
### **Responsibilities**


* Develop creative from concept to completion
* Design in a variety of styles, as well as work within client brand guidelines
* Design across all channels including print, digital, social and broadcast
* Collaborate and communicate with fellow creatives as well as other department members, all for the common goal of producing great work and happy clients
* Participate in brainstorming and collaborative sessions
* Present your work both internally and to clients
* Take ownership of projects and see them to completion, from kick‑off to print
* Manage multiple assignments simultaneously, in all stages of development
* Cut and construct studio comps for client meetings

### **Qualifications**


* 4+ years’ design experience in advertising, direct marketing or related agency environment
* Bachelor’s degree
* Strong conceptual thinker with the proven ability to translate marketing strategy into creative work
* Proven expertise with Adobe Creative Suite
* Digital marketing experience
* Experience in variable data printing a plus
* Ability to collaborate, brainstorm and work with a team
* Strong presentation skills, both internally and client-facing
* Detail-oriented with strong organizational and time-management skills
* Ability to manage multiple projects simultaneously in different phases of development

A problem isn’t truly solved until it’s solved for all. That’s why Googlers build products that help create opportunities for everyone, whether down the street or across the globe. As a Program Manager at Google, you’ll lead complex, multi-disciplinary projects from start to finish — working with stakeholders to plan requirements, manage project schedules, identify risks, and communicate clearly with cross-functional partners across the company. Your projects will often span offices, time zones, and hemispheres. It's your job to coordinate the players and keep them up to date on progress and deadlines.  

  

Our goal is to build a Google that looks like the world around us — and we want Googlers to stay and grow when they join us.

Examples of technologies we work on include: next-gen geothermal, advanced nuclear, long duration energy storage, grid technologies, and carbon removals technologies.

  

You will identify and architect commercial, investment, and partnership opportunities for Google to accelerate the commercialization of advanced clean energy technologies (e.g., next-gen geothermal, advanced nuclear, CCS, long duration energy storage, advanced grid technologies), in pursuit of our 24/7 Carbon Free Energy (CFE) and Net Zero goals.  

  

The Global Sustainability team enables Google to build a more sustainable future for everyone by driving strategy and solutions.

Founded in June 2023, Crete Professionals Alliance (Crete PA) aims to drive growth across accounting and professional service firms in the United States. Our initial venture in August 2023 involved acquiring a majority interest in the non-attest assets of a top 300 US-based national firm, positioning us alongside the top 100 US accounting firms based on cumulative revenue. With over ten partner firms, several deals under LOI, and substantial committed capital, Crete PA is poised to shortly become equivalent to a top 40 firm in terms of aggregate revenue, with ambitions to expand into a multi-country platform.
