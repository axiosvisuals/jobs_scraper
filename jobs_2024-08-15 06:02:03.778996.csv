You know it’s not all about achieving personal goals. While that does get you excited, what you really thrive on is using your exceptional communication and conversational skills to help others achieve theirs. You have no problem working autonomously or within a team and look forward to professionally developing and growing in a supportive, goal-oriented environment.
Now is the time to bring your talent to Orbis Education, where you’ll have the opportunity to play an integral role in providing college students the roadmap for success, from the moment they ask for information through their first day of class. Here’s a taste of how you’ll make your mark as an Admission Advisor with us.
As an Admission Advisor, a typical week might include the following:* Heart and Hustle. Working in the office you must be able to work autonomously to get tasks done efficiently and effectively.

The role might be right for you if you have:* A bachelor’s degree required. Don’t have a degree? Ask about our degree requirement and employee education benefits.
* Outstanding time management skills. In this role, you’ll be wearing many hats, so you’ll need to show that not only have you honed your time management skills, you also know how to prioritize competing priorities.
* Clear communication skills. You can explain just about anything to anyone and you’re comfortable communicating in-person, in writing, and on the phone. You’ll also need to communicate to your team, leadership, and partner university while also developing your listening skills.
* Self-motivated to learn & implement. You excel at learning from mistakes and are driven to strategize how to shorten the learning curve. You take ownership of the time you spend with your nursing students and constantly absorb training and coaching on how to be more effective for you, your university partnership, your team, and your students.
* High emotional intelligence. In this role, you’ll be coaching a diverse range of prospective college students, each with unique circumstances. You’ll also have partner relationships to develop and nurture. Ability to demonstrate empathy is key to success in this role.

The outcome of this role will ensure that Treasury has a robust management framework and operating model (people, process and controls, technology and data, and product & service capabilities) providing strategic insights, consistent execution, delivery through a culture of accountability, teamwork, inclusiveness and improvement.


This individual is accountable for supporting the Treasurer with both the day-to-day and strategic leadership of the Treasury function for Citigroup globally. Citigroup’s Treasury organization comprises approx. 1,600 people across nearly 100 jurisdictions and an additional 150 people managed on a matrixed basis. The role will be responsible for designing and driving the global organizational vision and the operational, people and culture strategy.


The key elements of the position are:

* to work through the organizational design, roles & responsibilities, and the related processes & controls for the functions responsible for funding, liquidity, asset & liability management, balance sheet management, and capital management, ensuring that the design of the roles & responsibilities of these functions is effective in the context of the overall enterprise, now and as the organization evolves in response to the Consent Order remediation work and changes in the external environment; for the avoidance of doubt, the scope of this responsibility will include functions both within the Treasury organization today and other functions that currently report up other lines within Citigroup
	+ One of the key dimensions of this functional responsibility will be to support the Treasurer to ensure that the International, Business Aligned, and Treasury risk stripes (capital, funding & liquidity, balance sheet management, and market access & execution), deliver together in a joined up way both at the top of house enterprise, and in each country and legal entity and at the business line level
* to develop and lead a plan to continuously improve the way in which the people and teams, responsible for funding, liquidity, asset & liability management, balance sheet management, and capital management, globally, work together and deliver together; consequential benefits of the improvement should include better team morale, clearer Treasury specialist career paths, better cross-functional cooperation and coordination across specialist processes, more talent mobility across function and location, a much better understanding across the functions of what other functions do / are responsible for, and improvement in the average performance level of the teams; again, the scope of this responsibility is for functions within the Treasury organization today and other functions that currently report up to other lines within Citigroup

* Maintaining a healthy partnership and dialogue with Risk partners across the risk stripes (e.g., Market Risk, Liquidity Risk, Strategic Risk (incl Capital), and particularly Operational Risk to ensure that the Treasury function is out in front of the partner organizations.
* Similarly, to understand the Audit Plan and how it is constructed in a strategic sense to address the key risks identified both in a balance sheet, capital, funding, liquidity, and asset & liability sense, as well as those identified with respect to processes & controls.
* Another key function of the role will be to consolidate the insights and priorities of the multiple advocacy activities proceeding at any time in the Treasury function and to synthesize those with the objectives of ensuring coordination, cross-functional insights, and specifically that all the activities are in fact aligned with the overall priorities of the enterprise.
* Partnering with the Chief Administrative Officer for Treasury to drive quickly towards an outcome where the Treasury processes are clear, the owners of those processes and both identified and have taken ownership for those processes with solid understanding & documentation of those processes, the key controls of the processes have been identified, the functioning of those controls is measured & monitored in a simple to understand way & that the Treasury organization has the routines to respond to anything regarding weakness in processes or controls that comes from this taking ownership.
* As a part of the driving of discipline of process & controls into the Treasury organization, the full documentation of the Process, the People in the process, the Technology used by the process, and the Data layer for each of the processes, needs to be complete and again exist within a routine that ensures that this information remains current. This individual will ensure that these documented processes, controls, people, technology & data designs are continuously challenged.
* To achieve the outcomes described above, the individual will ensure a very clear operating model for the Management Routines of the Treasury function, ensuring that they complement the Treasurer allowing him/her to deliver on the continuous need to improve the robustness of process & controls, efficiency and importantly effectiveness in a day-to-day and strategic financial resource optimization sense.


The role requires close partnership with senior Treasury leadership and the senior management team of the lines of business and functions of Citigroup, including key partners across all (1st, 2nd and 3rd) lines of defense.


The Head of Business Initiatives and Execution will need to have executive Treasury experience at a large globally significant financial institution (US GSIB) and demonstrate a strong understanding of the full remit of Corporate Treasury functions for such US GSIBs, as well as its links to wider CFO organization, the lines of business, the sales & trading business most specifically, and the overall Enterprise. The role requires global leadership and relationship building expertise and an ability to design, articulate, align, and execute a clear strategy for Treasury.


Acting with authority from the Treasurer, this is an executive role that requires independent action with the ability to build high performing teams, effective regulatory engagement and C-suite level interaction.


A proven track record in delivering large, transformative, complex bodies of work is required as this role will be responsible for developing plans and executing functional strategies, requiring coordination and integration across businesses, functions and geographies.


Qualifications / Experience:

* 20+ years industry experience
