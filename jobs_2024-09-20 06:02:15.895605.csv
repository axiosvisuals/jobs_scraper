Parker's Superior Health Care Community of Practice (SHCCP) is an innovative clinical program that will train diverse Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs), Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs), and Registered Nurses (RNs) to meet Parker's mission which is "" to provide with compassion and dedication, superior quality health care and rehabilitation for adults."" With this overarching idea, the project will be framed by a ""community of practice"" model, in which cohort members interact regularly to learn professional practices, become socialized into the culture of person-centered care, and come to see themselves as valuable, empowered community members who belong in healthcare. Supported by culturally and linguistically diverse staff/mentors, individual trainees become connected to the larger social order of the healthcare community. Access to professional/social networks give them knowledge, values, beliefs, and attitudes that are conducive to their professional empowerment and success; they contribute their own sociocultural and linguistic richness.


The result will be improved quality of care, professional and economic growth for the employees, a stronger long term care workforce capable of meeting current and future demands, and increased capacity to train a diverse workforce.


For this program, we are seeking a full time **Program Director,** who will be responsible for overseeing the recruitment and training elements delivered through the community of practice model, including the development of materials that are inclusive for diverse populations, advertising campaigns, liaising with contractors and community members, and data gathering.

*For more information about our benefits, see below!*


We are proud to be a member of the Rentokil family of companies, the global leader in Pest Control and other services across more than 90 countries. We pride ourselves on being a trusted partner to many of the world's leading brands and serve consumer and business customers across multiple industries. We are extremely proud of our legacy of excellence and constantly work to fulfill our mission to ""protect people, enhance lives, and preserve the planet.""

**Creepy crawlies and contented customers. Intrigued?**
-------------------------------------------------------

**You might be just who we're looking for.**
--------------------------------------------


Busting bugs has its benefits. Company-provided truck, gas, and phone. Benefits including a 401(k) with a company match. Amazing earning potential. But it’s more than that. It’s serving with a smile. It’s having your teammates’ backs. It’s going above and beyond and making a difference. We step in and step up when people have problems they can’t fix, and they need the pros. We crush their pest problems and lift their spirits.


Back to you. Are you a hard worker? Can you follow direction, adapt to change, and solve problems? Are you organized, friendly, and motivated to succeed? That’s a great place to start.

**As a Pest Control Technician, here’s what you can expect**
------------------------------------------------------------

* You won’t be tied to a desk. You’ll be out and about — mobile, independent, and growing your career with a clear view of next steps. You’ll be the face of Terminix to your local community (with the backing of a national brand), and your clients will count on you to protect their businesses, their homes, and their families.
* When you first join Terminix Nation, you’ll spend a few months in training. Once you’ve got that and some state required licenses and certificates under your belt, you’ll take the lead with your own customers.
* You’ll get rewarded with competitive pay and robust benefits to cover you and your family. As a teammate, you will be eligible for a 401(k) with company match, company-paid life insurance, tuition reimbursement, and a generous student loan repayment program. You put in the work, and you’ll reap the rewards.
* You’ll be part of a community — bonus points if you’re already a leader in yours. Our bonds are strong at Terminix Nation and the relationships we develop in the communities we serve are unparalleled. Our teammates give back through volunteering, donations, scholarships, and more.
* You’ll be onboarded and trained by the best of ‘em. You’ll get paid to get licensed, something you’ll have for a lifetime. You’ll know how to bust bugs at home, too.

**What your days will look like**
---------------------------------

* Roll up your sleeves and get ready to learn how we take care of customers. You’ll become an expert in applying our company products so they’re safe and effective.
* Are you a good driver? As a technician, your office is the cab of your Terminix truck. You’ll use it on calls and take it home, too. Same goes for your Terminix phone. We trust our technicians.
* You’ll be responsible for building relationships with customers, scheduling and confirming their appointments, helping with sales to current customers, and expanding our product to new customers.
* Does technology scare you? That’s okay. We provide training and support to ensure you’re comfortable using state-of-the-art tools. You’ll also need to have strong communication skills so that you can email, text, call, talk, and write effectively. Oh, and sometimes there’s paperwork.
* There’s an opportunity to grow into a role you’re passionate about and fits your skillset — whether that’s management, a move to sales, or another opportunity at Terminix.

**Some non-negotiables**
------------------------


There are some things you’ll just need to have or know to join Terminix Nation as a Pest Control Technician.

* High school diploma or GED; or one to three months related experience and/or training; or equivalent combination of education and experience.
* Solid reading, writing, and verbal communication skills and the ability to present information in both internal and external settings.
* Some basic math skills — add, subtract, multiply, and divide in all units of measure, using whole numbers, common fractions, and decimals. You’ll need to be able to follow instructions for mixing on product labels.
* With the help of Terminix (and with the company footing the bill), you’ll need to maintain the licenses/certificates as required by federal, state, and/or local regulations. And you’ll need a valid driver’s license.

**Straight talk about the physical demands of our work**
--------------------------------------------------------


We’re not going to sugarcoat it. The essential functions of this job have some physical demands (of course, reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the essential functions.) Here’s what we mean:

* You’ve got to be able to move up to 10 lbs. regularly and 11–20 lbs. frequently, whether that’s lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, or otherwise repositioning objects.
* You’ll move around a lot — regularly sitting, climbing, balancing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, and crawling. You’ll go up and down stairs, ladders, scaffolding, ramps, and poles. And you’ll need to keep your balance when walking, standing, or crouching on narrow, slippery, or moving surfaces. (You’ll definitely get your steps in.)
* You must be able to safely operate a motor vehicle and make sure it and all other equipment is kept clean.
* The vision to perform detail-oriented activities at distances close to the eyes or within arm’s reach.
* Sometimes you’ll need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE), like an OSHA-compliant respirator, and you’ll need to be okay with regularly working in confined spaces, narrow aisles, or passageways (you know, where critters live).

**Work conditions**
-------------------


Pests don’t always live in nice places — and that’s where we do our work. But don’t worry – we’ll prepare you with all you need to do the work as safely and as comfortably as possible.

* You’ll need to be able to work both inside and outside in your local climate in company-provided weather gear.
* You’ll sometimes be working around mechanical parts, vehicles, electrical current, heights and scaffolding, fumes, dust, and chemicals, and we’ll train you how to handle all of these conditions safely.
* This is kind of a no-brainer — you’ll be around animals and insects.
* And you’ll have to be okay with working in tight, confined spaces, narrow aisles, or passageways — like you might find in crawl spaces. We work where the critters live.


To join Terminix Nation, you’ll need to meet state and federal regulations and company safety requirements.

Default is the ultimate workflow platform for modern go-to-market teams. Combining beautiful, performant lead capture forms with lightning-fast meeting scheduling, data enrichment, workflow automation, powerful integrations, and more. Default’s all-in-one solution is designed to help companies make the most of every interested customer, saving countless hours and thousands of dollars of lost revenue for go-to-market teams. Our mission is to help the next generation of internet-first companies go from zero to IPO faster.


Founded in 2021, Default powers the go-to-market workflows for companies of all sizes, from seed-stage startups to growth-stage enterprises. Default's investors include Craft Ventures, 8VC, Jack Altman (CEO of Lattice), BoxGroup, and Menlo Ventures, as well as dozens of angel investors who were founders or executives of leading companies like Notion, Airtable, Ramp, Figma, and many more.

**About The Role**


Default is a compound startup. If you’re not familiar with this terminology, compound startups are big, ambitious bets on opportunities that span multiple point-solutions and business processes. In our case, we’re building around the customer lifecycle, starting by building a suite of tightly integrated products around the inbound sales funnel: forms, workflows, process automation, meeting scheduling, and email sequencing.


We are looking for a skilled Founding Customer Success Manager, ideally based in the New York Metro Area. This is a very, very important role for us — our revenue is growing faster than we can onboard customers, and it’s causing growing pains. At the same time, we’re launching new products and solutions for existing customers and don’t have anyone in place to own or drive the expansion of our footprint within accounts.


As the Founding CSM at Default, you will be on the front line of all GTM action. This role is non-trivial; our product serves as the connective tissue between Revenue Operations, Sales, & Marketing teams. Success in this role will require tenacity, intellect, hard work, agency, and excellent (top 0.1% communication skills). You will own everything from implementation, to success, to renewals and expansion. Your first priority will be ensuring that paid customers are able to implement Default’s workflow platform to its fullest extent. This will include collecting mission-critical criteria and go-live objectives, communicating with stakeholders and customers during the implementation cycle, addressing technical challenges and questions that arise, and providing elegant solutions.

**What You’ll Do**

* Build a bulletproof process for handling customers who are handed off from sales and helping them implement Default’s solution to its fullest extent.
* Collect mission-critical criteria for implementations, understanding sales team structure and tech stacks our customers use.
* Understand and become an expert in Default’s product offerings and map customer use cases to our relevant solutions.
* Understand the business objectives of your customers and map them to the value our products enable.
* Quickly identify customer needs and provide solutions during the implementation cycle.
* Provide hands-on support during implementation phases to ensure customer success.
* Address technical questions that arise during the implementation cycle. Our engineering team will be here to support you with this!
* Collaborate with our product and GTM teams, providing detailed feedback on how we can make our customers’ lives (and by extension, your life) easier!
* Maintain excellent verbal and written communication internally and externally.

**Reasons to Apply**

* Strong product-market fit and growth with our core ICP.
* 3+ years of runway and backing from incredible investors like Craft Ventures, Jack Altman, 8VC, etc.
* You don’t shy away from a challenge and you work really hard to make customers happy.
* You like working with smart, driven, and intense teammates.

**Requirements**

**Qualifications**

* Prior experience in a solutions engineering, customer support, or customer success role.
* Prior experience using tools like Salesforce, Google Sheets, Slack, etc.
* Ability to work collaboratively with small, cross-functional teams.

* Demonstrated ability to meet or exceed targets and quotas.
* Passion for software technology and a customer-first mindset.
* Prior experience running or administering proof-of-concepts with customers.
* Prior experience managing renewals and/or expansions.

**Bonus Skills & Attributes**

* Basic understanding of the solutions that comprise our initial market is a plus (Chili Piper, LeanData, RingLead, Salesforce Flows, etc).
* Prior experience in revenue operations is a huge plus.
* You’re adamant about playing a key role in an early-stage startup.
* Based in NYC (bonus).

**Benefits**

Salary is just one component of Default’s total compensation package for employees. Your total rewards package will include equity and top-notch benefits.
