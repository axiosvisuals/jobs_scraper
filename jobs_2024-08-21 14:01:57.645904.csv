ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF ANALYST - NON-MANAGERIAL, LEVEL 3  

  

Established in 1805, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (the NYC Health Department) is the oldest and largest health department in the country. Our mission is to protect and improve the health of all New Yorkers, in service of a vision of a city in which all New Yorkers can realize their full health potential, regardless of who they are, how old they are, where they are from, or where they live.  

  

As a world-renowned public health agency with a history of building transformative public health programming and infrastructure, innovating in science and scholarship to advance public health knowledge, and responding to urgent public health crises from New York City’s yellow fever outbreak in 1822, to the COVID-19 pandemic we are a hub for public health innovation, expertise, and programs, and services. We serve as the population health strategist, and policy, and planning authority for the City of New York, while also having a vast impact on national and international public policy, including programs and services focused on food and nutrition, anti-tobacco support, chronic disease prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, family and child health, environmental health, mental health, and racial and social justice work, among others.  

  

Our Agency’s five strategic priorities, building off a recently-completed strategic planning process emerging from the COVID-19 emergency, are:  

1) To re-envision how the Health Department prepares for and responds to health emergencies, with a focus on building a “response-ready” organization, with faster decision-making, transparent public communications, and stronger surveillance and bridges to healthcare systems 2) Address and prevent chronic and diet-related disease, including addressing rising rates of childhood obesity and the impact of diabetes, and transforming our food systems to improve nutrition and enhance access to healthy foods  

3) Address the second pandemic of mental illness including: reducing overdose deaths, strengthening our youth mental health systems, and supporting people with serious mental illness  

4) Reduce black maternal mortality and make New York a model city for women’s health  

5) Mobilize against and combat the health impacts of climate change  

  

Our 7,000-plus team members bring extraordinary diversity to the work of public health. True to our value of equity as a foundational element of all of our work, and a critical foundation to achieving population health impact in New York City, the NYC Health Department has been a leader in recognizing and dismantling racism’s impacts on the health of New Yorkers and beyond. In 2021, the NYC Board of Health declared racism as a public health crisis. With commitment to advance anti-racist public health practices that dismantle systems that perpetuate inequitable power, opportunity and access, the NYC Health Department continues to work in and with communities and community organizations to increase their access to health services and decrease avoidable health outcomes.

ABOUT NEW YORK BOARD OF CORRECTION
  

  

The New York City Board of Correction (“BOC” or “Board”) is a nine-person, non-judicial oversight board, which regulates, monitors, and inspects the correctional facilities of the City. The Mayor, City Council and presiding justices of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court for the First and Second Judicial Departments (in joint nomination with the Mayor) appoint its members. The Board’s original appointees began in 1957, making it one of the earliest independent oversight boards of detention settings in the United States. In 1977, the Board’s role was expanded, and it became more independent.
  

  

The City Charter mandates the Board’s five functions:  

* Establish and ensure compliance with minimum standards “for the care, custody, correction, treatment, supervision, and discipline of all persons held or confined under the jurisdiction of the Department of Correction”
* Investigate serious incidents
* Review grievances from people in custody and staff
* Evaluate the performance of the Department of Correction
* Make recommendations on areas of key correctional planning.

  

With offices in lower Manhattan and on Rikers Island, BOC works regularly with Department of Correction (“DOC”) and Correctional Health Services (“CHS”), and other government and external partners, on a wide range of criminal justice issues germane to its oversight responsibilities.

Warehouse/Material Handlers are responsible for a variety of warehouse duties. A key component of our success has been importing the very best ingredients for years.

It's a physical job! If you have never worked in a warehouse environment before, you should understand that you will be on your feet for **90% - 95%** of your shift. It also gets cold in the warehouse. While we want everyone to feel comfortable, our ability to control the temperature in our warehouses is limited. Indoor warehouse working conditions are impacted by seasons and the weather. Product safety is our priority, therefore temperature in warehouse must always be monitored. Forklift experience needed.

Here is a list of some of the more frequent tasks you could expect to perform during the course of the workday:

* Load and unload pallets, individual bags and cases to and from trailers, as well as collect empty pallet boards and carry them to storage
* Pick appropriate bags and cases according to order using required technology
* Safely operate a forklift
* Load trailers via carts or stack cases on the floor of a truck trailer
* Receive and distribute product and assist in weekly product inventory
* General housekeeping and specific sanitation tasks as required (e.g. you may be asked to sweep the floor, help clean a trailer, take out the trash, etc.)
* Lift objects that weigh anywhere between 15 pounds and 60 pounds (i.e. anything from a bowling ball to a twin-size mattress) with or without a reasonable accommodation
* Performs other duties assigned by supervisor
* Ability to efficiently work in a cold environment

The JJ NUTS, Warehouse team comes to us with a wide variety of experiences, usually after honing their skills with prior success in warehouses but also other fast-paced environments. While prior knowledge is always a plus, we are happy to provide thorough training on OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration), FDA (Food and Drug Administration), and FSMA (Food Safety Modernization Act) regulations.

Please be sure that you meet the following minimum requirements prior to starting your application:

* You are 18 years of age or older
* You can lift 15 to 60 pounds with or without a reasonable accommodation
* You are able to stand and walk for extended periods of time with or without a reasonable accommodation
* You are able to climb, bend, reach, stoop, kneel, and stretch for extended periods with or without a reasonable accommodation
* You are able to repeatedly lift, carry, push, pull, and handle products with or without a reasonable accommodation
* You are willing and able to work using forklifts to access areas of the warehouse
* You are willing and able to work in an environment that has extreme temperatures, humidity, hazardous/loud equipment, and slippery surfaces

People often ask what kind of characteristics will make them successful in this position. At a minimum, we expect you to show up because we track attendance closely.

Do you think you have what it takes to perform at our level? Here is an idea of what our supervisors are looking for:

* Communication: you will interact with coordinators, peers and supervisors about issues, downtime and breaks because communication is essential for a successful day.
* Flexibility: we look out for one another on the warehouse floor by being flexible when we must tackle production schedule changes, environmental changes, and sudden work schedule changes.
* Work Ethic: we expect you to go ""above and beyond"" on your assigned job tasks. We closely track performance and efficiency throughout work shifts. This includes volunteering for additional assignments not directly related to your specific job role because your performance helps the team achieve overall performance goals.
* Teamwork: we are dependable and accountable to one another because of our shared passion to attain targets and goals. Offering help to others without being asked to do so is expected at JJ NUTS.
* Attention to Detail: you make a conscious effort to pay attention to the task at hand, accurately read product codes and labels and correctly pick & load the correct quantity of products for shipment.
* Safety Focus: we wear safety equipment, follow current good manufacturing practices (CGMPs), perform proper forklift inspections and follow forklift operating guidelines and procedures, and communicate safety issues and concerns. We believe that safety is everyone's responsibility.

* A job for which military experienced candidates are encouraged to apply
