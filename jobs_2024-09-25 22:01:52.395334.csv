### **Open Date**

Sep 20, 2024
### **Description**

The Play & Language Lab at New York University, Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development, directed by Catherine S. Tamis-LeMonda, invites applicants for a full-time **Postdoctoral Associate**, beginning early- to mid-October, 2024.



The Postdoctoral Associate will oversee a study on toddlers' language interactions and math-related activities and understanding (words for number, space, locations, magnitudes, quantifiers) in the home environment, funded by the Robinhood Foundation. The Postdoctoral Associate will also oversee research on the temporal structure of behaviors in infants and caregivers (e.g., language, object interactions), funded by the National Science Foundation. Projects involve video recordings of mother-toddler interactions during natural home activities; video recordings of dyads during structured play (e.g., shape sorters, number books); assessments of toddler's math cognition; work on the application of basic research findings to programming for families around early math cognition; and the curated workshops, video clips, and text messaging to community partners and families.



Home visits will be conducted with 200 families from Mandarin- and Spanish-speaking households with toddlers aged 18 to 30 months. Videos of toddler-mother natural and structured activities will be transcribed (in Mandarin, Spanish, and English) and annotated for types of language and everyday activities. Assessments of toddlers' math cognition will be coded for child performance on spatial and numeracy tasks. Interviews with mothers will provide data on infant receptive and expressive vocabulary, home activities, and family demographics. Families will be offered opportunities to participate in workshops around the importance of supporting toddlers' emerging language.



Research responsibilities include analyzing, writing, and disseminating lab findings at conferences and in journals, and the oversight of staff around: recruiting families, preparation of protocols (with translations and back translations from Mandarin and/or Spanish to English), video-recordings in the home environment, video-based behavior annotation and transcription, tracking and sharing of data in the video repository of Databrary, presentations to families on math cognition, and oversight of text messaging to families. The Postdoctoral Fellow will also oversee administrative duties around purchasing research supplies, help with grant management, oversight and training of hourly staff, and general support to the PI and staff on the project.


*In compliance with NYC's Pay Transparency Act, the annual base salary range for this position is $62,500-$65,000. New York University considers factors such as (but not limited to) the specific grant funding and the terms of the research grant when extending an offer.*


*Per NYU's remote-work policy, this position is expected to be fully in-person.*

  



### **Qualifications**

**Applicant must be a native speaker or fluent in Mandarin and/or Spanish** to engage in translations, participant recruitment, data collection, data coding, and transcription. Qualifications include a PhD in developmental psychology, communicative sciences, or a related field, and experience working in a research setting (developmental psychology preferred), and a strong prior record of publication. The ideal candidate must have excellent verbal, written, and interpersonal communication skills, exceptional organizational skills, and the ability to manage multiple priorities. Knowledge of the field of early language development; previous experience with Datavyu behavioral coding software; experience with video curation, data visualization, analyses in R, preparation of talks in Keynote or Powerpoint, and prior experience transcribing and analyzing infant language.

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington).

Miner Ltd, an OnPoint Company, is an industry-leading service and equipment solutions provider with branch-based operations across the country. OnPoint Group is a fast-paced and ever-changing company and has been awarded the **Best Managed Companies** Award by Deloitte and WSJ for three years running, as well as having been named to the **Inc. 5000 Fastest Growing Companies** list for eight consecutive years! We believe in challenging the status quo and finding a better way for our customers, which is how we have grow into the company we are today.


Miner drives down the cost of warehousing and materials management operations saving our customers revenue and time by understanding their business, finding efficiencies in their operation, providing faster systems repairs and delivering expertly executed scheduled maintenance. For more than 20 years, Miner has consistently delivered professional emergency maintenance service, equipment analysis and proactive preventative maintenance solutions to companies throughout North America. Miner solutions leave their customers more time to focus on their core business – not on the business of maintenance and materials management.

**Job Summary**


Our Dock & Door Technicians a.k.a. “Service Professionals” are the core of our preventative and emergency response services for our customers. You may call them a “technician”, but the role is more than using tools to fix broken items. Service Professionals are on the road, troubleshooting complex issues in places like commercial buildings, aircraft hangers, schools, fire/police departments, and much more. A Service Professional might spend an hour fixing a broken door for a hospital garage and an hour later they could be heading to a large warehouse to fix loading dock equipment. This role has unique access to see the inner workings of some of the largest operations in North America, and that’s just before lunchtime.
