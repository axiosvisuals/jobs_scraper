We are committed to helping students better understand how they learn and how they can take ownership of that learning. Our team provides educational solutions for adolescents and children through individual assessment, personally tailored learning programs, and one-on-one coaching.

  

Freudigman & Billings uses a unique approach to standardized test preparation that focuses on critical thinking, applied reasoning, and problem solving strategies. We help students understand fundamental principles about how the world of information is organized and how they can interact with that information. This process does not involve the rote memorization of vocabulary or inundation of practice questions that many associate with “test prep.” Instead, we focus on teaching students effective strategies for gathering, sequencing, categorizing, and classifying information from text and visual sources. These processes contribute to a student’s ability to reason, solve problems, make inferences, and draw conclusions.

  

The Assistant Director of Standardized Test Prep plays a critical role managing the Test Prep program and is dedicated to providing administrative and functional support to the Director of Test Prep. The work is as rewarding as it is challenging as we help students navigate one of the most important steps forward in their education. The ideal candidate not only has a background in coaching for standardized exams and content areas related to standardized testing, but also possesses an inherent curiosity about the process of developing individualized educational plans and a desire to gain mastery of the minute details necessary to implement and monitor the programs across time.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion are important, interdependent components of everyday life and are critical to the successful pursuit of our school vision and mission.

 **Our Key Design Elements**

 ***Inquiry-Based Study of the Science of Sustainability*** BUGS will be a middle school focused on the science of sustainability, which incorporates the natural sciences, math, economics, history, social sciences, and the humanities to examine the intersection of human and ecological systems.

 ***Extended Time for Learning*** Longer blocks of class time, a longer school day and a longer school year will provide additional time to: maximize learning opportunities; implement innovative, cross-disciplinary approaches to curriculum, instruction, and assessment; and provide rigorous supports for ELLs, special education, and struggling students.

 ***A Positive and Inclusive School Climate*** BUGS will create a safe, welcoming, and respectful school climate that supports equity and access for all learners. Through its advisory program, school-wide discipline program, positive behavior supports, and research-based interventions, BUGS will foster a college-bound, career-ready student body that respects and values the diversity of others in their community and around the world.

 ***A Professional Learning Community*** A learning-focused, collaborative culture will be based on trust, shared instructional leadership, and mutual accountability. Daily common planning time and on-going professional development will enhance teachers‘ collective focus on student learning.

 ***Authentic Assessments and Individualization*** Instruction is driven by ongoing, authentic assessment and analysis of academic and behavioral data, which will support students‘ individual needs and is facilitated by trained and supported teachers.

 ***Use of Technology*** Computer-based instruction will allow for intensive, targeted remediation in basic skills, individualized learning and assessments, and the development of 21st century skills in visual, media and technological literacy.

 **Our Inclusion Model**

  

At BUGS we believe that all students are capable of succeeding when consistently given the appropriate support. This, along with our sustainability integration, is core to our academic program. At BUGS we use various co-teaching models to meet students’ and lessons’ needs. We support an inclusion model that focuses on Universal Design for Learning (UDL), which supports differentiated instruction and Specially Designed Instruction. We believe families are equal partners in this work and must have consistent communication.

 **Within Our Inclusion Model, BUGS co-teachers are expected to…**

 ***Share the Workload*****.** While one teacher is usually a certified special education teacher, both BUGS teachers are expected to serve all students fully.

 ***Utilize a variety of strategies at all times to reach all students****.* These include providing differentiated instruction, modifications, and accommodations in the form of small groups, graphic organizers, leveled texts, strong vocabulary support, adapted or leveled texts, multiple access points/opportunities to content, and more. This is rooted in a UDL approach that supports all learners.

 ***Leverage Co-teaching*****.** Teachers should review units/lessons and determine which co-teaching models are best suited for each lesson. It is expected that the parallel, station, alternative, and team teaching models be prioritized during lesson planning.

 ***Conduct Routine Progress Monitoring.*** Teachers, co-teaching teams, grade teams and departments must routinely analyze data to support instructional decisions.

 ***Know which students have mandated support*****.** Teachers are expected to know the specific needs of students with IEPs, 504s, and ELL designations, supported by the Director of Inclusion and Assessment, and plan to meet the needs throughout the school day.

 **BUGS team members are reflective, open-minded, innovative,** **industrious self-starters who:**

StaffCo is a Professional Employer Organization, commonly referred to as a PEO, duly organized and registered under the New York Professional Employer Organization law. StaffCo and SUNY have entered into a professional employer agreement under which StaffCo is the employer of Stony Brook Clinical Practice Management Plan employees and responsible for all aspects of employment, including hirings, promotions, disciplines, terminations, the day-to-day direction and supervision of work, as well as labor relations and collective bargaining. StaffCo is fully responsible for providing all payroll and human resources services, including the payment of wages, collecting and reporting payroll taxes and maintaining any and all employee benefits. SUNY Stony Brook Hospital is responsible for the operation of the hospital and provision of health care and is the co-employer as is necessary to conduct its responsibilities and for related licensure, regulatory or statutory requirements and obligations.  

Given StaffCo’s employment responsibilities, it is deemed the “employer” for employment and labor law purposes. Thus, the employees are private sector employees of StaffCo, not public sector employees of SUNY. The private sector nature of the StaffCo employees has been approved by NYS Civil Service and upheld in a decision by the US National Labor Relations Board.
