We’re Heartbeat, the marketing agency for Healthcare Challenger Brands and the brave clients behind them. And hopefully you’re our next Search Planner helping us to deliver game-changing campaigns for consumers & HCPs.

  

Read on to learn more about what qualities we’re looking for in a new member of the crew and why you’re gonna dig working with us.

 **Job Description** **How you’ll strengthen the team:**


Our team is looking for someone who is driven, organized and a master collaborator. Beyond that, here’s how you’ll make your mark:

* Day-to-day management of paid search accounts: budget pacing/monitoring, optimizations
* Generate keyword lists and assist with ad copy development
* Implement and track client campaigns, monitoring/questioning deliverables. Confidence and clarity on deliverables
* Conduct keyword research and competitive/market analyses; be able to present findings in both informal and formal environments
* Produce reports that analyze campaign activity
* Recommend testing opportunities or optimizations to clients and internal teams, provide industry findings & POV on execution
* Proficiency in AdWords, Microsoft Advertising, Google Analytics, and SA360 (among other tools)
* Ability to communicate with both internal teams and clients professionally and concisely
* Compiling, analyzing and delivering account performance data to internal and external clients

 **How you’ll grow with us:**


Search Planner is where you’ll start, but we’re always planning for where you’ll go. Our Paid Search Planners are all expected to hone skills that will help build on their careers. Those skills include:

* **Assisting in process innovation and documentation to inform best practices for Paid Search**
* **Honing presentation skills via Marcel training and ‘Speak From the Heart’ which will better prepare you for client-facing opportunities**
* **Contributing to annual Media Planning exercises to refine data analysis capabilities**

 **Hell yes, I want to do all of that. But tell me more about Heartbeat…**


Heartbeat is a healthcare marketing & creative agency, headquartered in NYC and powered by ~300 smart people all over the US. In the past four years, we’ve been named a 4-time “Best Place to Work” by *AdAge* and *MM+M* and a “Diversity & Inclusion Champion” by *MedAdNews*.

  

We care about three big things:

 **1. Empowering Challenger Brands**  

We work with marketers who have big mountains to climb and the ambition to make it happen. As their sherpa and sidekicks, we must relentlessly deliver on our core values: insightful, inventive, and courageous.

 **2. Being the Best Place You’ll Ever Work**


This isn’t all pool tables and Bagel Fridays — it’s about giving you the support to do and be your best. Examples include the ability to work wherever (forever), unlimited PTO, and self-care stipends. We also love to let loose, whether through selfie scavenger hunts or bouts of companywide bingo that would shock even the rowdiest retirement communities.

 **3. Fostering a Diverse & Caring Community**


We’re the most diverse agency in healthcare, by design. No matter your story, you’ll find representation and amplification — through our affinity groups, cultural celebrations, and unwavering support no matter what society throws at us. We’re proud to say that you can be anything you want at Heartbeat (as long as it’s not an a\\*\\*hole).

  

There’s a reason 1/3 of Heartbeaters have been here for 4+ years and we have a 90% retention rate. We hope you’ll experience it for yourself.

 **Qualifications** **What you’re bringing with you:**


Across 2-3 years of experience, you know what it takes to slay Paid Search. These are the core skills you’ve totally nailed:

* Demonstrated knowledge of paid search best practices and optimization
* Proficiency in Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, Search Engine Tools
* A degree of “search nerdery” – a passion for what’s new in an evolving industry
* Ability to think on one’s feet and participate in team knowledge development
* Excellent written and verbal communication skills; some client-facing experience
* Experience working with healthcare/finance/”sensitive industry” clients a plus

  

**Additional Information**  

Compensation Range: $46,500 - $68,500 annually. This is the pay range the Company believes it will pay for this position at the time of this posting. Consistent with applicable law, compensation will be determined based on the skills, qualifications, and experience of the applicant along with the requirements of the position, and the Company reserves the right to modify this pay range at any time. For this role, the Company will offer medical coverage, dental, vision, disability, 401k, and paid time off. The Company anticipates the application deadline for this job posting will be 9/24/2024

**The Opportunity**



CEO is currently seeking to hire an Job Developer for our local office, a role that's crucial to CEO's work to help individuals coming out of incarceration regain the skills and confidence needed for a successful transition to stable and productive lives.



Job Developers increase the range of employment opportunities available to our participants using participant interests, experiences, and their ambitions as foundation for participant job placements, and more broadly, for the identification and cultivation of potential employers for prospect portfolios.



The most rewarding part of being an Job Developer is the joy you feel upon making the ""right fit"" match between participant and employer. Your expertise and insight lead not only to successful matches in the now, but to participant longevity in the workforce which often drastically reduces the rate of recidivism.



As part of our mission, we strongly encourage individuals who have lived experience of incarceration or involvement in the justice system to apply for this role.


**Who We Are**



The Center for Employment Opportunities (CEO) provides employment services to people recently released from incarceration. Across the United States, 8,000-9,000 people participate in CEO each year, transitioning to employment that supports themselves, their families, and their communities.



What began as a demonstration project of the Vera Institute of Justice in the 1970s to address employment barriers facing the formerly incarcerated following release in New York City has grown into the leading reentry employment organization in the country, where over 30,000 formerly incarcerated individuals have secured full-time employment since 1996.


**Who You Are**

* You have excellent interpersonal and written communication skills with the ability to adjust to particular personalities and interaction styles on the spot
* You're resilient and never give up, anticipating and addressing challenges along the way while keeping your eye on the end goal
* You're comfortable working under pressure and meeting deadlines despite opposition or setbacks
* You're able to look at a set of data or market research and use it to guide your practice and decision-making

***Relationship Cultivation and Maintenance***


* Research, conduct outreach to, and build relationships with prospective employers willing to hire CEO participants and who have hiring needs that match the skills, experience, and interests of our overall participant cohort
* Maintain relationships with existing employer partners
* Schedule and conduct daily prospecting, cold calls, and face-to-face meetings
* Serve as the liaison among employers, participants, and our criminal justice partners


***Job Placement***


* You are expected to produce up to 6-10 direct placements a month
* Screen and match program participants with employment opportunities, taking into consideration each participant's skills, work experience, interests, and goals and aspirations
* Customize participants' resumes to fit identified opportunities
* Manage a caseload of participants, support and coach them around applying for jobs, navigating the hiring process, and finding and securing right fit employment


***Administrative Support***


* Document all participant and employer contact, activities, and outcomes in our case management system (Salesforce)
* Perform other job-related duties and responsibilities assigned from time to time


**Compensation and Benefits**



The salary for this position is **$57,500**. In an effort to be both equitable and transparent, CEO's compensation philosophy considers a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, experience, internal equity, and home office location in making a final determination on our salary offer.



We recognize that salary is a part of the overall compensation package and also provide a comprehensive benefits package, including medical and dental coverage, as well as professional development opportunities and training, including regular training opportunities in Motivational Interviewing (MI). MI is one evidence-based skill that reentry and human service professionals can utilize when supporting participants to achieve their goals.



We also offer paid parental leave, participation in a retirement plan, sick and vacation leave, paid holidays and more. We are a workplace that promotes continual learning and teamwork, offering lunch and learns, team outings, holiday gatherings and more for our staff.

We are seeking an ambitious and driven Postdoctoral Associate excited to do cutting-edge research at the intersection of biology, chemistry, and physics in the lab of Dr. Martin Jonikas at Princeton University. The Jonikas lab and collaborators are spearheading the molecular characterization of the pyrenoid, a mysterious phase-separated organelle that mediates a third of global CO2 fixation and that we aim to engineer into crops to dramatically increase yields. The lab has defined the pyrenoid's protein composition, discovered that it is a liquid-like organelle, characterized the structure and biogenesis of one of its three sub-compartments, the matrix, and developed a predictive model to guide its engineering. The lab has also developed community resources for the leading model alga Chlamydomonas, including a genome-wide mutant library and a systematic protein localization atlas. More information about the lab can be found at https://jonikaslab.princeton.edu/.
About the role:
The successful candidate will lead a research project seeking to make significant advances in basic understanding in an area related to ongoing work in the lab.
Projects are available in multiple areas, including the following:* Membrane tubules feed the pyrenoid with concentrated CO2. How are these structures made, and how do they work?
* Engineering a pyrenoid into plants has the potential to increase crop yields. Can we engineer a functional pyrenoid into a heterologous organism?
* We are developing a new instrument with unprecedented capabilities for mapping the sub-cellular distribution of CO2 and other small molecules. What can we learn about the spatial distribution of metabolism using this tool?
* We have discovered dozens of uncharacterized protein complexes in the chloroplast. What are these complexes doing?
* What basic principles can we uncover by using the pyrenoid as a model system for phase-separated cellular condensates?


Application Instructions  

Please include the following items as part of your application:* A cover letter including answers to the following questions: 1) How have you advanced scientific understanding in your previous work? 2) What questions are you most excited about? 3) How would working on them help launch you onto your future career goals? and 4) How do you see your skills and experience synergizing with the Jonikas lab?
* Your curriculum vitae.
* Names and contact information for at least 3 references.
* PDFs of up to three most significant manuscripts.


What we provide:* Exciting projects with potential for both discovery of basic principles and real-world impact.
* A nurturing, collaborative, and highly interdisciplinary environment, with frequent interactions with different flavors of biologists, physicists, and chemists.
* Access to cutting-edge tools and experts in their use, including robotics, advanced quantitative mass spectrometry, super-resolution microscopes, cryoelectron microscopy and tomography, and a unique microscope under development for imaging the subcellular distribution of small molecules.
* We aim to never be limited by resources - only by our creativity and time.
* Labmates who are both outstanding scientists and nice, fun people.
* A PI who values people, creativity, grit, teamwork, diversity, communication, work hard/play hard, productivity, mental health, safety, and constant growth.
* One-on-one mentorship relationship with the PI.
* Opportunities for co-mentorship by other Princeton faculty.
* Access to collaborating local laboratories with complementary expertise in biological phase separation.
* Access to outstanding international collaborators with complementary expertise in characterizing and engineering photosynthesis.
* A vibrant town with easy access to New York City and Philadelphia, hiking in New York and Pennsylvania, and the New Jersey shore.


What you’ll do:* Define and lead your own research project.
* Solve complex problems in creative and effective ways.
* Develop and maintain a high level of professional expertise through familiarity with scientific literature.
* As needed, investigate, create, and develop new methods and technologies.
* Design, execute, and interpret experiments that contribute to the project.
* Prepare summaries, protocols, and quantitative analyses.
* Mentor junior lab members.
* Present your work at scientific conferences.
* Publish your work in scientific journals.


What you bring:* Ph.D. degree in a scientific discipline.
