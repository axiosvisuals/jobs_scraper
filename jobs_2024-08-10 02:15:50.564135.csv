**About Us:**



Competitive triathletes and passionate bakers, Pam Weekes and Connie McDonald left their careers to open a small bread shop in New York City in 1995 — Levain Bakery.  

One day, they baked a BIG chocolate chip walnut cookie as energy for triathlon training. At Levain, a batch of these 6-ounce cookies flew off the shelves, and an icon was born. The cozy shop on West 74th Street became a neighborhood favorite and a destination for epicurious visitors from around the world, hungry for “the cookie.”  


From the start, Pam, Connie and team baked everything fresh on-site each day, donating the day’s leftovers to charity — and we still do, nearly 30 years later. Today, Levain has bakeries across the country (with more to come!), plus ecommerce gift boxes to treat cookie lovers in every state.  


Every day, we strive to embody our company’s five core values:
* Welcome All- *we are all in it together*
* Work Hard and Be Nice- *we go above and beyond*

StaffCo is a Professional Employer Organization, commonly referred to as a PEO, duly organized and registered under the New York Professional Employer Organization law. StaffCo and SUNY have entered into a professional employer agreement under which StaffCo is the employer of Stony Brook Clinical Practice Management Plan employees and responsible for all aspects of employment, including hirings, promotions, disciplines, terminations, the day-to-day direction and supervision of work, as well as labor relations and collective bargaining. StaffCo is fully responsible for providing all payroll and human resources services, including the payment of wages, collecting and reporting payroll taxes and maintaining any and all employee benefits. SUNY Stony Brook Hospital is responsible for the operation of the hospital and provision of health care and is the co-employer as is necessary to conduct its responsibilities and for related licensure, regulatory or statutory requirements and obligations.

  

Given StaffCo’s employment responsibilities, it is deemed the “employer” for employment and labor law purposes. Thus, the employees are private sector employees of StaffCo, not public sector employees of SUNY. The private sector nature of the StaffCo employees has been approved by NYS Civil Service and upheld in a decision by the US National Labor Relations Board.

  

CPMP provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, creed, gender, national origin, age, disability, marital or veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or any other legally protected status. This policy applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including recruiting, hiring, placement, promotion, termination, layoff, recall and transfer, leaves of absence, compensation and training.

The Empire State Building Observatory (ESBO) is New York’s City most iconic, the most Instagrammed U.S. landmark, and the world’s most famous building that has wowed millions of global visitors as they witnessed the jaw dropping views whether from its popular 360-degree, open-air Observatory, or its 102nd floor floor-to-ceiling glass enclosed viewing gallery. We are a wholly owned subsidiary of Empire State Realty Trust.


The ESBO has recently undergone a top-to-bottom renovation that includes a dedicated Guest entrance, an immersive, tactile, and digital museum that celebrates our icon from the moment it was conceived to its place today in pop-culture, and a completely re-imagined 102nd floor viewing experience (www.esbnyc.com). Within the museum’s more than one dozen memorable moments, we could not resist but sprinkle a little extra fun with the inclusion of our Kong exhibit where visitors walk through an office from the 1930’s complete with the famous, giant ape's fingers pierce the walls as he dangles from the building and dodges vintage fighter planes. Those brave enough can even step into Kong's hands – but beware, you might feel the power of this fearsome ape firsthand!


The renovations also include industry-leading Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) improvements such as bi-polar ionization, MERV 13 filters, and increased ventilation that led to the building’s achievement as the first building in the Americas to receive the WELL Health-Safety Rating.


Overall, the Guest feedback has been stellar! New York Times’ quote: “…exhilarating and intimate.”

Do you define success as the ability to drive revenue, EBIDTA, and deliver an exceptional experience?
