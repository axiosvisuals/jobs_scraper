**About Us:**



Competitive triathletes and passionate bakers, Pam Weekes and Connie McDonald left their careers to open a small bread shop in New York City in 1995 — Levain Bakery.  

One day, they baked a BIG chocolate chip walnut cookie as energy for triathlon training. At Levain, a batch of these 6-ounce cookies flew off the shelves, and an icon was born. The cozy shop on West 74th Street became a neighborhood favorite and a destination for epicurious visitors from around the world, hungry for “the cookie.”  


From the start, Pam, Connie and team baked everything fresh on-site each day, donating the day’s leftovers to charity — and we still do, nearly 30 years later. Today, Levain has bakeries across the country (with more to come!), plus ecommerce gift boxes to treat cookie lovers in every state.  


Every day, we strive to embody our company’s five core values:
* Welcome All- *we are all in it together*
* Work Hard and Be Nice- *we go above and beyond*
* Lead with Heart- *we do the right thing*
* Rise Up- *we are proactive*
* Savor It- *we are present and find the fun!*","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Levain-Bakery","http://www.levainbakery.com","New York","2 to 10","less than $1M (USD)","","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/1497c6aa21dc80b7a30bd7185f92e8ca","","",""

***Climate Central is seeking an energetic, strategic, and seasoned Director of Development to raise funds in support of the organization’s mission to communicate climate change science, effects, and solutions to the public and decision-makers.***

#### **About Climate Central**


Climate Central is a dynamic science, technology, and communications organization. Its staff of leading scientists, tech experts, and communication professionals are dedicated to researching and reporting on climate change and its impacts and solutions. Founded by top scientists at Princeton, Yale, and Stanford and a generous philanthropist in 2008, Climate Central provides a bridge between the public and climate scientists and contributes in a pivotal way to the national and international efforts to communicate the facts of climate change.


Thousands of scientists have declared that the planet is now facing a climate emergency — and that how humanity responds this decade will shape every aspect of our common home for hundreds of years to come. No past generation has been in a position to make such a profound and lasting difference for so many people.


Climate Central’s team is a leader in developing and delivering effective, science-backed climate communications via trusted messengers to diverse key audiences across the U.S. and around the world.


As an independent, non-partisan science organization, Climate Central researches and reports the facts about climate change impacts, such as extreme weather, drought, flooding, wildfires, and sea level rise, as well as alternative energy systems and transportation. Climate Central is not an advocacy organization and does not lobby or support any specific legislation, policy or bill. In addition to its policy-neutral, non-partisan stance, its values include scientific and journalistic integrity and the importance of informing the public, effective communication, and collaboration.


Climate Central is exceptional in reaching large audiences with localized information that makes the impacts of climate change relevant and personal. The organization uses science, big data, and technology to generate thousands of local storylines and compelling visuals that make climate change relevant and show what can be done about it. Content is delivered through trusted local messengers at scale, including in areas with below-average levels of climate understanding and concern. The goal: to catalyze a response in proportion to the problem.

Such studies have predominantly focused on the earliest stages of cancer progression,such as the formation of a cancer or genes involved in the growth of the primary tumor. In humans afflicted by cancer,the primary tumor is typically surgically resected or eliminated by radiation. Vast numbers of patients,nonetheless,die of cancer as a result of metastasis or the spread of cancer cells from the primary tumor site to distal organs. This process is,in fact,the overwhelming cause of death from cancer,and its occurrence changes a patient's prognosis to incurable. Despite its vast clinical significance and inherently fascinating underlying biology,the metastatic program is poorly understood both at the molecular level and at the cellular/tissue micro-environment levels. Our laboratory employs a multi-disciplinary approach involving molecular,biochemical,computational,imaging,and clinical association methods to characterize the critical regulatory pathways that mediate the steps of this process. By implanting human cancer cells obtained from patients with breast or colon cancer into recipient mice,we study and interfere with the various stages of metastasis. By comparing human cancer cells that are highly metastatic to those that fail to metastasize,we have uncovered a set of small RNA molecules (microRNAs) that suppress metastasis.

Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE: RSG) is a leader in the environmental services industry. We provide customers with the most complete set of products and services, including recycling, waste, special waste, hazardous waste and field services. Our industry-leading commitments to advance circularity and support decarbonization are helping deliver on our vision to partner with customers to create a more sustainable world.


In 2023, Republic’s total company revenue was $14.9 billion, and adjusted EBITDA was $4.4 billion. We serve 13 million customers and operate more than 1,000 locations, including collection and transfer stations, recycling and polymer centers, treatment facilities, and landfills.


Although we operate across North America, the collection, recycling, treatment, or disposal of materials is a local business, and the dynamics and opportunities differ in each market we serve. By combining local operational management with standardized business practices, we drive greater operating efficiencies across the company while maintaining day-to-day operational decisions at the local level, closest to the customer.


Our customers, including small businesses, major corporations and municipalities, want a partner with the expertise and capabilities to effectively manage their multiple recycling and waste streams. They choose Republic Services because we are committed to exceeding their expectations and helping them achieve their sustainability goals. Our 41,000 team members understand that it's not just what we do that matters, but how we do it.


Our company values guide our daily actions:

* **Safe**: We protect the livelihoods of our colleagues and communities.
* **Committed to Serve**: We go above and beyond to exceed our customers’ expectations.
* **Environmentally Responsible:** We take action to improve our environment.
* **Driven**: We deliver results in the right way.
* **Human-Centered:** We respect the dignity and unique potential of every person.


We are proud of our high employee engagement score of 86. We have an inclusive and diverse culture where every voice counts. In addition, our team positively impacted 4.6 million people in 2023 through the Republic Services Charitable Foundation and local community grants. These projects are designed to meet the specific needs of the communities we serve, with a focus on building sustainable neighborhoods.

**STRATEGY**


Republic Services’ strategy is designed to generate profitable growth. Through acquisitions and industry advancements, we safely and sustainably manage our customers’ multiple waste streams through a North American footprint of vertically integrated assets.


We focus on three areas of growth to meet the increasing needs of our customers: recycling and waste, environmental solutions and sustainability innovation.


With our integrated approach, strengthening our position in one area advances other areas of our business. For example, as we grow volume in recycling and waste, we collect additional material to bolster our circularity capabilities. And as we expand environmental solutions, we drive additional opportunities to provide these services to our existing recycling and waste customers.

**Recycling and Waste**


We continue to expand our recycling and waste business footprint throughout North America through organic growth and targeted acquisitions. The 13 million customers we serve and our more than 5 million pick-ups per day provide us with a distinct advantage. We aggregate materials at scale, unlocking new opportunities for advanced recycling. In addition, we are cross-selling new products and services to better meet our customers’ specific needs.

**Environmental Solutions**


Our comprehensive environmental solutions capabilities help customers safely manage their most technical waste streams. We are expanding both our capabilities and our geographic footprint. We see strong growth opportunities for our offerings, including PFAS remediation, an increasing customer need.

 **SUSTAINABILITY INNOVATION**


Republic’s recent innovations to advance circularity and decarbonization demonstrate our unique ability to leverage sustainability as a platform for growth.
