We're currently hiring in our NYC office and there are options to take leads in all boroughs. There are also options for residential buyer & commercial leads.

**About Amo Realty**

Our company originally opened in Boston in 2007 (Boston City Properties was our first office). We expanded nationally. We currently have 13 very small offices in 13 states. We expanded to NYC in 2020.

**Leads**

We give at least 20+ apartment renter leads per week. The leads come in from a variety of sources. We've had the exact same system since 2007 and it works with a small group. We're under water with leads in NYC and could actually give way more than 20+, however agents can count on 20+ leads per week.

Aside from apartment rentals, we also give our agents commercial leads every week (typically 5+ leads per week for commercial). The clients are mainly looking for office space, retail, restaurant, multi family properties across NYC. One of our agents closed a $22 million sale from one of our leads. We have a sustainable lead system that is meant just for a small group.

There is also an option to take on residential buyer leads.

Aside from NYC, there is an option to take leads in Westchester and Long Island.

**Training**

The system that we have works best for agents who have at least some experience. We do provide training, and it's mainly centered around technology to obtain clients and drip campaigns for follow-up.

**Split Info**

We provide clients with agents at a 50/50 split. Agent's own leads start off at 75% for the first 3 years. A $5,000 cap system for agents own leads is implemented for agents who have been with the company for 3 years. After the 3 year mark, agents keep 100% for the rest of the year for their own leads after $5,000 comes in on a 75/25 split. Company leads continue at a 50/50 split. It's a 100% split for agents that buy or sell their own properties.

There are no desk fees, no monthly fees, and no transaction fees.

The split is non-negotiable; please only apply if you are okay with the split system.

**\\*\\* We're looking for loyalty\\*\\*** 

Our lead system only works if we do not have any turnover. We have very low turnover, and the first agent ever hired in 2007 still works at our company. We need agents that are going to close sales and stay with us for the long run.
