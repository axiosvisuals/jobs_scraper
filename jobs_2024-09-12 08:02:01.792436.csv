Apps like Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world. Now, Meta is moving beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality to help build the next evolution in social technology. People who choose to build their careers by building with us at Meta help shape a future that will take us beyond what digital connection makes possible today—beyond the constraints of screens, the limits of distance, and even the rules of physics.

The Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office is one of the largest prosecutorial offices in the country, and has recently launched a number of cutting edge initiatives and reforms that have put it on the national stage for innovation. Whether it is the Office’s new Violent Criminal Enterprises Bureau, its increased use of electronic surveillance or the focus on prosecutorial ethics and enhanced training, Suffolk County is the place to be. We are looking for the most qualified candidates to join our ranks, with the objective of recruiting those with diverse backgrounds, a strong work ethic, integrity and a commitment to public service and justice. Upon joining the team, newly hired Assistants will undergo a rigorous training program, which has recently been developed and implemented by the new administration. It entails extensive on-the-job-training, interactive CLE courses, mentoring, second seating, and off-site training provided by the National District Attorneys Association's National Advocacy Center and the New York State District Attorneys Association's Prosecutor's Training Institute. In addition to training, the Office has recently invested in new technological tools to further empower our Assistants to reach their full potential and best represent the People of the State of New York.  

  

Accepting a position with the Office is an investment in your future. The Office is committed to providing exciting career opportunities for all Assistants. The Office investigates and prosecutes a wide variety of crimes, and is committed to assigning ADAs to Bureaus that match with their interests and strengths.  

  

Starting annual salary for new Assistants District Attorneys is competitive and includes a comprehensive benefits plan. As ADAs are promoted, salaries are attractive compared to our sister offices in the State.  

  

But most of all, we are a team: one that is committed to making our community a safe place to live, work and raise a family.  

  

And Suffolk County is indeed an extraordinary community to be a part of, with vibrant downtowns, close proximity to New York City, the best beaches in the world with over 1,000 miles of coastline and a world class winery scene that attracts millions of visitors each year.  



**Salary and Benefits:**  

Unadmitted prosecutors will start at $77,987. Upon admission to the bar, your salary will increase to $84,251.  

  

Benefits include health insurance, including optical and dental benefits, vacation/personal/sick time, maternity and disability leave, deferred compensation, New York State Retirement, life insurance, legal and other benefits.


**Career Track:**  

New Assistant District Attorneys ordinarily begin their tenure in the District Court Bureau where they prosecute misdemeanor crimes and gain investigative and trial experience. The Office has implemented a “vertical prosecution” policy, so that a case is assigned to an individual ADA prior to or at arraignment and remains with that same ADA through trial, plea or any disposition. With proper advancement of knowledge and skills, ADAs will then move into the various senior bureaus within the three divisions: the Trial Division, Criminal Investigations Division and the Special Investigations Division. There, ADAs will develop specialized skills in criminal investigations and prosecutions of all types. In each case, the Office is committed to employing cutting edge investigative and prosecutorial strategies to make Suffolk County as safe as possible to live, work, and raise a family. Come join the team.
