Safe Horizon’s Child Advocacy Centers (CACs) are a key component of the services we provide.

Serving more than 4,000 child victims each year, our CACs provide child friendly locations for children, their non-offending caregivers, and other impacted family members to receive expert, coordinated services. Our co-located approach minimizes the need for repeated interviewing, reduces the risk of further trauma, and helps the child and family heal and attain justice in a more expedited and coordinated manner.

**PROGRAM BACKGROUND:**  

The bridges to the future program supports our foster care youth as they prepare for the future.

In addition to providing weekly emotional support, Coaches help young people make progress towards their academic, career development, housing/independent living, and other life goals.

The Symphony is renewing its deeply rooted commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion by championing new, and often local, artists; engaging audiences for whom the inspiring depth and breadth of classical music will be a new experience; and incorporating the broadest possible representation in all aspects of our organization-all to better reflect and serve our vibrant communities.

With a new strategic plan in the final stages of development, the New Jersey Symphony now embarks on a bold vision for the future, the centerpiece of which will be a new Symphony Center that includes a 550-seat, versatile performance space in Jersey City. The Symphony Center will host New Jersey Symphony chamber music events and diversified programming, including non-classical music events, and become a permanent home base for the Symphony with offices and space for education programs. This transformational initiative and expansion into Jersey City will make the organization a community place-maker and will be the largest venue in Jersey City’s Powerhouse Arts District – a city that is on track to surpass Newark as the most populated city in the state.

* Prepare materials for funder meetings.
* Assist in fulfilling benefits for funding partners by tracking activity, working with marketing colleagues to produce collateral material and providing on-site support for events.

**Other Areas of Focus**
