**ESSENTIAL DUTIES AND RESPONSIBLITES:**  

* Go above & beyond to ensure the needs of each Special Events Guest are met, communicating all requests from host to ensure all contracts are updated accordingly.
* Take RFP’s and calls for social events, converting them to closed “won” business.
* Conduct Site tours as needed.
* Ensure accurate and prompt distribution of all paperwork for “pop up parties” working through management team to ensure they are staffed to support.
* Provide administrative support to the Sales Department including follow up on calls/emails/tasks with Event Host after the sale is “closed won”, communicating to Operations any changes to BEOs or updated signed contracts.
* Follow up on AR’s, collect payment information, and close out any remaining balances.
* Submit check requests/invoices as needed.
* Ensure Operations has the most up-to-date BEO for each event.
* Offer “upsell” opportunities to Event Hosts after sale is “closed won”.

Because we expect you to “Act like you own it” your job includes everything listed above PLUS the ever popular “other” duties as assigned”. If you see a need, meet it; if you have an idea, share it; if you see a Team Member needing help, jump in and lend a hand.

StaffCo is a Professional Employer Organization, commonly referred to as a PEO, duly organized and registered under the New York Professional Employer Organization law. StaffCo and SUNY have entered into a professional employer agreement under which StaffCo is the employer of Stony Brook Clinical Practice Management Plan employees and responsible for all aspects of employment, including hirings, promotions, disciplines, terminations, the day-to-day direction and supervision of work, as well as labor relations and collective bargaining. StaffCo is fully responsible for providing all payroll and human resources services, including the payment of wages, collecting and reporting payroll taxes and maintaining any and all employee benefits. SUNY Stony Brook Hospital is responsible for the operation of the hospital and provision of health care and is the co-employer as is necessary to conduct its responsibilities and for related licensure, regulatory or statutory requirements and obligations.  

Given StaffCo’s employment responsibilities, it is deemed the “employer” for employment and labor law purposes. Thus, the employees are private sector employees of StaffCo, not public sector employees of SUNY. The private sector nature of the StaffCo employees has been approved by NYS Civil Service and upheld in a decision by the US National Labor Relations Board.
