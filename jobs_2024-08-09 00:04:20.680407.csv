* Build contacts network: The specialty (re)insurance business is a people business, and sources generate exclusive leads
* Report key industry events: We attend and cover a large number of events across the U.S. and internationally
* Write interviews and features: The main focus of the role is news, but we will also offer the opportunity to develop your other writing skills to support our multiple platform coverage
  

  

**About You**

  

  

You’re a fit for the role of **U.S. Reporter (Level 1 Journalist)** at **The Insurer** if your background includes:

* At least two years’ experience covering the financial services sector is preferred.
* A demonstrable hunger for news and for delivering a range of content .
* Good communication skills – you will regularly be engaging with C-suite executives at companies in the sector we cover and will be expected to build a network of sources.
* A proven appetite for digging beneath the surface – the quality of our coverage is dependent upon our journalists’ willingness to look behind the headline and seek trends to add value to what we publish
