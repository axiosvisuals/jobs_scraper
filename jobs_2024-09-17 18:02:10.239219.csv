Another day on the job hunt.

But you’re looking for more than just a paycheck aren’t you?

**Please read to the bottom of the ad for directions on how to apply.**

You’re looking for your calling. For a way to make a difference. For something that when you clock out for the day you can’t help but feel good about the time you just put in, the lives you changed. You want to hear laughter in the halls because your colleagues have perfected the art of getting the job done while having a good time. And you want people to leave your presence thinking “she saved my life!”

Oh, and in an ideal world you get all this without being confined by a cubicle and 40 hour work weeks.

So let us introduce ourselves.

We are Wellspring Health, an integrative medicine and acupuncture clinic in Union Square, NYC. We specialize in fertility, pregnancy, chronic pain and complicated conditions (the kinds of things that leave most practitioners scratching their heads) and giving our staff jobs that actually mean something in a fun, rewarding environment that prides itself on work-to-live hours and fair wages.

You’re probably thinking ‘this is just too good to be true.’ But we assure you, we’re an exception to the ‘all that glitters isn’t gold’ rule - so long as the words ‘that’s not my job’ aren’t in your vocabulary’ and you have a charming personality that can only be described as “everyone’s favorite grandkid.”

The ideal candidate thrives in controlled chaos and has been known to ‘never let ‘em see you sweat.’ You are known in certain circles for your multitasking abilities but always make people feel like they're the only one in the room. When you crack a joke, you almost always nail the punchline.

You are a bright light of optimism and a strong shoulder for which to lean on as you help our patients on their journey towards true health and wellness - as you help them get back to living life!

More about us:

We have a weekday schedule (M-TH with optional to work Friday + 2 Saturdays a month). We also occasionally have community events as community engagement is a cornerstone of what we do.

We offer a competitive wage, commensurate with experience, and infinite room to grow as we ourselves face exponential growth. Translation: this could be a promising career for the right candidate.

No medical background? No problem!

We hire uncut gems - authentic, resourceful, outgoing personalities and then train you to do the rest.

If you’re inspired by the possibilities, and would like to join us in our mission to change as many lives as possible and help people grow their families and to live lives free from pain and suffering, send your resume AND cover letter telling us why you’re the perfect candidate with the subject “Uncut Gem” to wspringh. nyc @ gmail..com

PLEASE DO NOT CALL US

Here’s a hint - if you fail to submit your application to the address above, you won’t be considered. Essentially, “ability to follow basic instructions” is a pretty important requirement of the job.

Third Bridge is a market-leading investment research firm. We provide integrated solutions for the world’s top investors and business leaders to help them make smarter and faster decisions. No other company in the world provides the same holistic investment offering: our superpower is the combination of human insights and unique investor-led content with a global expert network. We serve over 1,000 investment firms, offering clients 24/7 coverage through our team of 1,300+ employees located across eight offices.

 **Job Description** **What is Private Equity (PE)?**


In a nutshell, our private equity clients invest in companies with the intention of increasing the value of their stake down the line. The insights they get through our experts and content become the basis of their decision to invest in opportunities, or to pass on them.


Would you like to learn more about our early careers Associate position? Take our free virtual job simulation and learn what it is like to work in this role.

**Associate, Private Equity Clients**


As an Associate you’ll have opportunities to work with the sharpest minds in private equity funds. They will rely on you for access to the most relevant experts and content, which you are responsible for identifying and recommending to them throughout their investment lifecycles. To do so you'll gather a unique set of commercial skills that will help you deliver extraordinary results for both clients and experts, and grow professionally. The projects can be complex, but the impact is meaningful - every day you will get to hear directly from your clients, experts and colleagues about the difference you have made.

**The hats you will wear:**

* **Salesperson:** listen to your clients and tailor our offering in a way that best suits their unique needs. Use your negotiation and persuasion skills to create value for our specialists.  

In practice: you will pitch our entire suite of products (content and expert calls) to investors in your book of business, and you will convince experts (from CEOs to technical experts) to speak to your clients about their industry.
* **Business developer:** understand the drivers of profitable revenue and find your path to grow it. Work with your team to execute strategies for the accounts you are responsible for.  

In practice: this could mean calling investors who have never used our services to build relationships and get business from them.
* **Problem solver:** A client can challenge you with any company name and questions: you’ll break down an industry within minutes, suggest who they should speak with and what they should read.  

In practice: you will search for relevant content and vet experts to support your clients at each stage of their research*.*You will not give them investment advice.
* **Learner:** apply the knowledge and skills you acquire on the job to improve your productivity and find innovative ways to continue advancing our business model.  

In practice: when a process gets in the way of your speed, you propose an alternate solution and speak with the right people to implement it.

*Curious about our Consulting and Funds verticals? Check them out and decide which feels right for you. Focusing on an asset type allows our Associates to speak our clients’ language and intricately understand how they operate.*

 **Qualifications** **Areas that play to your strengths:**

* You must be able to deliver high quality work on a **deadline**. You will be working on lots of active workstreams simultaneously, but that doesn’t scare you - in fact it excites you, and you’re confident in your ability to **multitask** and remain **organized**. Private equity investors are under a lot of **pressure** to make decisions fast, but you stay calm and get things done. If at times your client asks you for help out of hours, or your expert is in a different time zone, you strive to support - your hours vary according to the client project you are involved in, but you prefer that to a routine job. There is **no typical week** as a Third Bridge Associate.
* The **Founder’s Mentality** completely resonates with you, as this approach is part of our DNA. You’re an **independent thinker** who feels energized by the freedom Associates have to come up with the best solutions for their clients, because you’re endlessly **curious** and often question the way things are done. As long as you are **eager to learn**, we’ll provide you with the resources and coaching you need as you bring value to your clients and experts.
* You’re a clear **communicator** who can create the right narrative to share your ideas with a wide range of people, such as introducing our products and services to new clients and experts. You find that conversations often lead to **strong relationships** with people because you easily connect. You always look for the most **efficient** way to get things done, rather than the path of least resistance - for example you **pick up the phone** to get an answer to your questions straight away, rather than send an email and wait for a reply. Cold calling doesn’t phase you - what matters to you is to get results, and fast.
* Your attitude is to **roll up your sleeves** and you enjoy being in the thick of the **action**. It matters a great deal to you to understand how your performance ranks against your own potential and against others, so you continuously seek **feedback** to make sure you can be at the top of your game. One of your clients preferring a competitor over you is not an acceptable state of affairs for you - you’re **relentless** in getting the data points you need to adjust your approach until you are their number one. With the **soft skills** gained on the job (hard skills are getting displaced by machines), you aspire to a future as a high EQ business leader.

  

**Additional Information** **What our people love about being Associates in PE:**

* Being surrounded by people they not only enjoy working with, but who also challenge and support them
* Partnering first hand with the leading investors in the world and being privy to their thought process with all the learning this leads to
* Building their career in business on a foundation of problem-solving, communication and commercial skills

Living by “great minds think differently” in a diverse and inclusive team

Reports to: Vice President, Solutions Design

  

Learning Ally is a leading nonprofit education solutions organization that transforms the lives of struggling learners by delivering proven literacy solutions that help students reach their potential. Its mission is to radically change education, transforming the lives of children by providing reading interventions and solutions to help them succeed academically, build self-confidence, and thrive in school and beyond.


65% of fourth graders read below proficiency and are 400% more likely to drop-out of high school. And, for “most at risk” students (students of color, low income, English Language Learners and students with learning disabilities) the problem is even more acute.


Learning Ally seeks to break this cycle. With early student assessment, intervention and accommodation and professional development for educators, Learning Ally can identify and prevent learning issues by working with schools and educators to support new and struggling readers. Our solutions build a strong foundation for independent, engaged learners who are empowered to achieve socially, emotionally, and academically, regardless of background or learning difference.


Founded in 1948 as Recording for the Blind, to help soldiers who lost their sight in combat continue their education with audiobook products, Learning Ally has evolved to help individuals understand the unique ways they learn and match them to the solutions that enable personal achievement.


Today, Learning Ally reaches over 2,300,000 students, 300,000 educators and 23,000 schools across the country and continues to expand its reach. With a continued commitment to supporting students who learn differently, Learning Ally has joined researchers and neuroscientists from renowned institutions including UCSF and MIT, to better understand and address learning issues. You will find that our culture is one that is very committed to our mission, innovation, professional growth, and diversity, equity, and inclusion.

 **If you want Courtroom Action Read Below:**

  

Why did you go to law school?

  

A. To review boring documents?


B. To spend the rest of your life doing legal research and writing memos?


C. To fill out time sheets to make other lawyers wealthy?


D. To defend corporations against lawsuits for the harms they caused?


E. To do foreclosures or to collect debts from poor people with no means?


F. To evict people and their families from houses?


G. None of the above

  

Yes, our society does need lawyers that do all of the above. I’m not knocking them because some of them are my best friends. Hopefully, your answer was G. But, if your answer to any of the above is yes, other than G...read no further and don't bother to call me. On the other hand, if your mom, dad, or Uncle Charlie told you that you should be a lawyer because you like to argue; or if your favorite part of kindergarten was “Show and Tell” then we want to interview you for an exciting career as a trial lawyer.

  

Let’s face it, most people don’t go to law school to become experts in reviewing oil and gas leases. Again, I’m not knocking that, but I went to law school to be like the lawyers on TV and in the movies. Yes, a trial lawyer, in the courthouse, talking to judges and juries representing real people. So, if that’s your dream, don’t settle for less and contact me for an exciting career as one of the new hires joining our 28 personal injury trial attorneys of which 11 are NJ-certified civil trial attorneys by the Supreme Court of New Jersey.

  

You may think that this job post is different. You are correct. We trial lawyers act differently, think differently, communicate differently, and are certainly not boring. We are excited, curious, ambitious, fun-loving, and lethal in court. If you want boring…follow your dreams and good luck. But, if you want excitement, we’re your future because Uncle Charlie probably called it right.
