**About Us:**



Competitive triathletes and passionate bakers, Pam Weekes and Connie McDonald left their careers to open a small bread shop in New York City in 1995 — Levain Bakery.  

One day, they baked a BIG chocolate chip walnut cookie as energy for triathlon training. At Levain, a batch of these 6-ounce cookies flew off the shelves, and an icon was born. The cozy shop on West 74th Street became a neighborhood favorite and a destination for epicurious visitors from around the world, hungry for “the cookie.”  


From the start, Pam, Connie and team baked everything fresh on-site each day, donating the day’s leftovers to charity — and we still do, nearly 30 years later. Today, Levain has bakeries across the country (with more to come!), plus ecommerce gift boxes to treat cookie lovers in every state.  


Every day, we strive to embody our company’s five core values:
* Welcome All- *we are all in it together*
* Work Hard and Be Nice- *we go above and beyond*
* Lead with Heart- *we do the right thing*
* Rise Up- *we are proactive*

The Director will bring a passion for the mission of Harlem Children’s Zone: break the cycle of intergenerational poverty with comprehensive, on-the-ground programming that builds up opportunities for children and families to thrive in school, work, and life.



Community Pride, one of HCZ’s oldest programs, was created to ensure that we are truly addressing the needs of the neighborhood. This program works closely with tenant groups, block associations, faith-based institutions, and local businesses to create a strong, cohesive community where residents feel empowered and united in their mutual investment in helping Harlem thrive. Assistance and connections to resources are also provided to help address community needs such as housing insecurity, safety, and legal concerns. Community Pride supports residents as they develop into effective leaders who can successfully advocate for themselves and their families.



Among Community Pride’s most important responsibilities is its regular work with Community Advisory Boards (CABs) and the commitment to the St. Nicholas Housing Development. The residents and stakeholders across our 103 blocks are committed to helping HCZ ensure that we are addressing local needs. The Program Director will continue to develop relationships with families and residents in and around the St. Nicholas housing development, where we opened our new state-of-the-art school building and community center in 2013. This facility is a bold demonstration of our holistic approach. In fostering communication between residents and HCZ, Community Pride is ultimately helping us deepen our roots, expand our impact, and support the whole community.



We are seeking an experienced Program Director who can efficiently drive daily operations, meet short-term goals and ensure long-term sustainability, manage client relationships, and enhance the overall presence of HCZ in the community. The ideal candidate will bring a passion for the mission of HCZ, and an understanding and respect for the culture of all residents of Harlem. The Program Director must be a strategic thinker who can create and implement effective systems to increase the productivity and impact of Community Pride in the Harlem community.

Want to be part of a company that empowers you to innovate and implement your powerful ideas as you help shape the future of cybersecurity? Since 2012, CRITICALSTART has assisted in safeguarding numerous businesses from cyberattacks, preparing them for upcoming threats, and earning a plethora of awards along the way.  

We thrive on innovation, devoid of bureaucracy. CRITICALSTART pioneered the first MOBILESOC app for on-the-go threat detection and response, devised a method to automatically resolve the majority of security alerts, and introduced services that reduce alert investigation time by 99.3% (our analysts truly appreciate us for that).  

Everything we do revolves around our three core principles:  

Do what’s best for our customers.
Do what’s best for our employees.
Don’t do things that suck.  

That's basically it.  

If you'd prefer to hear from our Critical Crew, watch this video to learn about their perspectives.

Safe Passage Project (SPP) is a highly focused nonprofit immigration legal services organization that provides free lawyers to immigrant children facing deportation. Founded in 2013, SPP has grown to include 50+ employees, two offices, and an annual budget of over $5 million. It manages over 1,300 open cases a year.


To date, SPP has supported more than 3,000 young people in NYC and Long Island. The New York Immigration Courts, some of the busiest immigration courts in the US, have more than 15,000 juveniles on their dockets, many of whom are fleeing trauma in their countries of origin such as gang violence and recruitment, abuse, and sexual assault. Immigrant children are not afforded free legal representation by the government, regardless of their age. As a result, more than half of immigrant children in immigration proceedings must go to court without the aid of a lawyer. Among unaccompanied children with legal representation, immigration court data shows that 73% are allowed to remain in the United States, whereas only 15% of unrepresented children are allowed to stay. This is where Safe Passage Project steps in, both through providing immigrant youth with direct representation by staff attorneys and through a robust network of pro bono attorneys who SPP attorneys train, mentor, and supervise.


**About The Role**


We are looking for a Spanish-speaking, detail-oriented professional to join a growing team of paralegals who work collaboratively to assist attorneys in Safe Passage Project's immigration legal practice. Attorneys are directly responsible for representing children in family court, immigration court, and at the asylum office.

* Drafting client communications and completing immigration-related application forms;
* Providing clerical and administrative support to the organization;
* Supervising volunteers and undergraduate interns;

* Proficiency in Microsoft Office, including Word and Excel, and G Suite; and
* A commitment to the work of Safe Passage Project and readiness to grow and learn with the Safe Passage Project team.
