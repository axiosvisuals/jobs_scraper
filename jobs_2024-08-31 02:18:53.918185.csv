**Who We Are:**



BALDOR HISTORY:



When Louis Balducci rented a pushcart for $5.00 a week in 1918, little did he know that he was laying the foundations for Baldor Specialty Foods. In 1946, Louis opened a fruit stand called Balducci’s Produce in Greenwich Village that flourished into a beloved specialty food shop. Food writer James Beard was a regular customer and noted that Balducci’s always sold “the best of the best, at the right price.”



A family business from the start, the company employed numerous family members including son-in-law, Kevin Murphy. Murphy ran Balducci’s wholesale division, Baldor, so passionately that the Balducci family encouraged him to establish the business as an independent entity in 1991. Over the next decade, Baldor sustained continuous growth while maintaining the standard of excellence that made Balducci’s a success. The company cemented its reputation for sourcing expertise after introducing blanched frisee to the American market. Murphy named it “Circus Frisee” after famed restaurant Le Cirque.



Today, Baldor is the leading importer and distributor of fresh produce and specialty foods in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. The company is headed by Kevin’s son, T.J. Murphy, C.E.O. Under his leadership, Baldor remains committed to customer service, quality and innovation.



Baldor Specialty Foods has a long legacy of quality, consistency and service. Under the leadership of the former Owner and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Murphy, President Mike Muzyk joined Baldor in 1996 and today works closely with Kevin’s son, TJ Murphy, who has been the Owner and Chief Executive Office since 2013. Under the leadership and partnership of TJ and Mike, in the last seven years, Baldor has achieved consistent double-digit growth in addition to geographic, category, product and channel expansion.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Baldor-Specialty-Foods","http://www.baldorfood.com/","155 Food Center Drive Bronx, NY 10474","1,001 to 5,000","$100M to $500M (USD)","","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/e3b9819e55268c9e7c73e5714df9a2f2","","",""

**About Syracuse University**
Syracuse University is a private, international research university with distinctive academics, diversely unique offerings, and an undeniable spirit. Located in the geographic heart of New York State, with a global footprint, and over 150 years of history, Syracuse University offers a quintessential college experience.  

  

The scope of Syracuse University is a testament to its strengths: a pioneering history dating back to 1870; a choice of more than 200 majors, 100 minors, and 200 advanced degree programs offered across the University’s 13 schools and colleges; over 15,000 undergraduates and over 6,000 graduate students; more than a quarter of a million alumni in 160 countries; and a student population from all 50 U.S. states and 123 countries. For more information, please visit http://www.syracuse.edu.
  

**About the Syracuse area**
Syracuse is a medium-sized city situated in the geographic center of New York State approximately 250 miles northwest of New York City. The metro-area population totals approximately 500,000. The area offers a low cost of living and provides many social, cultural, and recreational options, including parks, museums, festivals, professional regional theater, and premier shopping venues. Syracuse and Central New York present a wide range of seasonal recreation and attractions ranging from water skiing and snow skiing, hiking in the Adirondacks, touring the historic sites, visiting wineries along the Finger Lakes, and biking on trails along the Erie Canal.
  

**EEO Statement**
Syracuse University is an equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution. The University prohibits discrimination and harassment based on race, color, creed, religion, sex, gender, national origin, citizenship, ethnicity, marital status, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression, veteran status, or any other status protected by applicable law to the extent prohibited by law. This nondiscrimination policy covers admissions, employment, and access to and treatment in University programs, services, and activities.
  

**Commitment to Supporting and Hiring Veterans**
Syracuse University has a long history of engaging veterans and the military-connected community through its educational programs, community outreach, and employment programs. After World War II, Syracuse University welcomed more than 10,000 returning veterans to our campus, and those veterans literally transformed Syracuse University into the national research institution it is today. The University’s contemporary commitment to veterans builds on this historical legacy, and extends to both class-leading initiatives focused on making an SU degree accessible and affordable to the post-9/11 generation of veterans, and also programs designed to position Syracuse University as the employer of choice for military veterans, members of the Guard and Reserve, and military family members.
  

**Commitment to a Diverse and Inclusive Campus Community**
Syracuse University maintains an inclusive learning environment in which students, faculty, administrators, staff, curriculum, social activities, governance, and all other aspects of campus life reflect a diverse, multi-cultural, and international worldview. The University community recognizes and values the many similarities and differences among individuals and groups. At Syracuse, we are committed to preparing students to understand, live among, appreciate, and work in an inherently diverse country and world made up of people with different ethnic and racial backgrounds, military backgrounds, religious beliefs, socio-economic status, cultural traditions, abilities, sexual orientations and gender identities. To do so, we commit ourselves to promoting a community that celebrates and models the principles of diversity and inclusivity.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Syracuse-University","https://www.syr.edu","900 South Crouse Ave.
