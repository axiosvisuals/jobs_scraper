**Viva La Pet** is the area's longest-established, award-winning pet care service providers. As pioneers in the industry, we set the standards for those in the field. Our mission is to provide our community with customized, exceptional and trust worthy pet care by following our Peace of Mind Blueprint. We are looking for active and fun animal devotees to join our team.

**About the job:**

VLP team members provide dog walking & pet sitting in Denville, Morris Plains, Randolph and the surrounding areas for the Viva La Pet client-base.

**Who we look for:**

We look for people who can *self-manage.*

We want those who are *team-oriented*, those who *bring positive energy to their environments*, those who are *honest*, *committed*, *professional* and *passionate*.

Those who LOVE the idea of spending their time giving snugs to all the pets, *being active outdoors*, and providing care that keeps our clients boasting about our services.

We want those who are genuinely kind & honest people who realize the complete joy that is dogs & cats and those who recognize the privilege it is to spend time caring for other’s pets.

We want people of integrity, authenticity and those who are one thousand percent reliable.

We care for some of the most important creatures on the planet, so we won’t sugar coat exactly what we are looking for in a VLP team member. Continuing in that spirit:

* You must be good at managing details. We personalize our client’s care to their dogs’ exact needs. We have a lot of instructions for each and every dog/cat/lizard/etc that we work with, and you have to be able to follow those instructions to the letter.
* You need to have dog handling, walking & pet care experience. We work with lots of different kinds of pets. You must bring a demonstrated ability to walk dogs and care for animals.
* You need to have excellent time management skills. Our team members do anywhere from 2-9 appointments a day. Sometimes they are scheduled back to back and other times they are not. You must be able to manage your time accordingly.
* You must be able to communicate well, both in written form and spoken. You must be willing to communicate through texts, calls and our app with a sense of urgency. We are in the business of giving people peace of mind, and we expect a high degree of clarity in communication to our clients and team.
* You must be the kind of person who leaves their personal issues at home. We all have bad days, but in the end, we are working with animals. It’s scientifically proven that spending time with animals brings our stress levels down. With this gig, we don’t have to sit behind a desk and our clients don’t talk back. If you don’t see the absolute value in this position, please don’t apply.
* You must be a person of integrity and honesty. Our core values are care, communication, honesty, reliability and consistency. These must be characteristics that you already live in your day to day life.
* You must have a clean background check, an insured & reliable personal vehicle, and a smart phone. You also must be able to provide us with professional references.
* You must be comfortable with working outside in all types of weather (heat, rain, freezing temps, etc)

**Those best-suited for our team:**

We look for people who are looking to make supplemental income. This job won’t pay your rent or mortgage. We want people who have flexible availability and those who are okay with taking on a few “last minute jobs” per month.

If you are an active retiree, a student who can offer us seasonal pet sitting, a person with their afternoons free for daily dog walking, a freelancer or anyone with EITHER (not all):

* Open availability between 10:30 and 2:30 repeated weekdays for **daily dog walking**
* Open availability to take on some last-minute walks and pet sitting assignments is a PLUS!

We want this to be the best part time gig ever. We want you so enjoy yourself and have fun. On average our people stay with us for 12 or more months and **we prefer you commit to at least 12 months**. We are all about positive energy and smiles, but this is not a job where calling out regularly is tolerated. You must commit to your client’s schedules.

**The details:**

Our **daily dog walking** positions (Monday-Friday) on average start at 1-3 walks per day (unless you are taking over a book of clients from a previous walker). We have a culture of helping out team members and encouraging team members to pick up extra work as wanted and needed, so 6-9 walks per day is doable in time. Take on as little as 3 walks per day or as many as 8 per day. This is totally up to you, but you must commit to a reoccurring weekly schedule.

**Compensation:**  
As an independent contractor you’re paid per assignment rather than an hourly rate.

We also offer referral bonuses, fun contests and extra pay if you choose to work on holidays.

**EACH WALK IS 25-30 MINUTES. You will get paid PER WALK.**

After some time and positive feedback from clients we will increase your pay per visit according to our VLP tiered payment structure.

**You must live within an 8 mile radius of the towns we service to be considered.**

**BALDOR HISTORY:**



When Louis Balducci rented a pushcart for $5.00 a week in 1918, little did he know that he was laying the foundations for Baldor Specialty Foods. In 1946, Louis opened a fruit stand called Balducci’s Produce in Greenwich Village that flourished into a beloved specialty food shop. Food writer James Beard was a regular customer and noted that Balducci’s always sold “the best of the best, at the right price.”



A family business from the start, the company employed numerous family members including son-in-law, Kevin Murphy. Murphy ran Balducci’s wholesale division, Baldor, so passionately that the Balducci family encouraged him to establish the business as an independent entity in 1991. Over the next decade, Baldor sustained continuous growth while maintaining the standard of excellence that made Balducci’s a success. The company cemented its reputation for sourcing expertise after introducing blanched frisee to the American market. Murphy named it “Circus Frisee” after famed restaurant Le Cirque.



Today, Baldor is the leading importer and distributor of fresh produce and specialty foods in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. The company is headed by Kevin’s son, T.J. Murphy, C.E.O. Under his leadership, Baldor remains committed to customer service, quality and innovation.



Baldor Specialty Foods has a long legacy of quality, consistency and service. Under the leadership of the former Owner and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Murphy, President Mike Muzyk joined Baldor in 1996 and today works closely with Kevin’s son, TJ Murphy, who has been the Owner and Chief Executive Office since 2013. Under the leadership and partnership of TJ and Mike, in the last seven years, Baldor has achieved consistent double-digit growth in addition to geographic, category, product and channel expansion.
