***What is Leukopaks:***

Leukapheresis is the collection of leukocytes — also known as white blood cells or immune cells. A donor reclines in a chair and blood is drawn through a vein in one arm. An apheresis machine removes white blood cells from the superfluous biofluids, separates them based on density, and collects them in a collection bag known as a leukopak. The remaining red blood cells and platelets are then returned to the same donor through a vein in their other arm. (The white blood cells that have been removed will be replaced quickly.) The white blood cells collected are frequently referred to as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and contain B cells, T cells, stem/progenitor cells, and dendritic cells. Leukapheresis allows for a concentrated, pure method to obtain PBMCs from a single individual donor.

Leukopaks are used when many PBMCs are needed from an individual donor, such as drug screening (immuno-oncology and non-oncology), cell therapy (research and development), and gene therapy. Sourcing healthy donor PBMCs allows for the use of single donor cell populations with greater viability and less inter- and intra-assay variability, as well as to development of well-characterized methods of production for autologous therapies (cell therapies where a patient’s cells are modified for treatment). For these cell therapy developments, large numbers of PBMCs sourced from a single donor are important for creating relevant biological assays, as well as for quality control testing. In these cases, healthy donors are matched to patients in terms of demographic criteria, such as age and gender, and physiological criteria like HLA type, which can provide valuable insights into the progress of the patient’s autologous cell therapy.

We take care of you, while you take care of others. As a mission-based organization, we believe our team needs great support to do great work.

--------------



The Farmer's Dog is the fastest growing pet health service company in the US, and was born from a mission to change the landscape of pet health, providing dogs and their humans with honest, smart, and simple care – a fresh proposition in an industry riddled with manipulative and misleading marketing. We're starting by radically improving the $100 billion pet food market, replacing bulk bags of highly-processed pellets with a personalized subscription service that sends healthy, freshly-made dog food, balanced by top veterinary nutritionists, directly to customers' doors. Our ultimate goal is to create innovative, honest, and delightful experiences across all aspects of pet care, and we believe our direct-to-consumer business model, holistic approach to growth, and dynamic and forward-thinking culture uniquely position us to shepherd this backwards industry into the future.



To date, The Farmer's Dog has delivered hundreds of millions of meals nationwide and raised over $150M in funding to help us build a company as healthy as the dogs who are eating those meals. Join us as we continue to develop ways of bringing peace of mind to our customers, health to their companions, and much-needed change to the way people feed and care for their pets.



#LongLiveDogs


**Where You'll Come In**
------------------------



We have big ambitions, our mission is to give dog lovers true peace of mind by helping them do the best for their dogs – this will require us to completely reimagine how we care for our dogs and drive meaningful shifts in an industry that is desperate for change. We don't believe this is possible by implementing ""best practices"" or operating how the rest of the industry operates.


**One Team:** We don't think of ourselves as ""Marketers"", ""Engineers"", ""Data Analysts"", or ""Product Managers"". Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we don't think departments matter. We'd rather align ourselves to the goals we're working to achieve and make sure we have the necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER – getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms to solve problems holistically.


**We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing:** Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we aren't tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know there's a better or more impactful way to solve problems.


**We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions:** We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is. We ensure our strategy sets customers up for success and drives long-term retention. We answer questions and address problems early and proactively.


**We execute for impact:** We're uninterested in how we compare to ""benchmarks""; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we don't subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles – i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience.



One of the unique things about not subscribing to the traditional and classic definitions of roles is that we expect you to have an active hand in shaping this role. You should come in focused on seeking context, and be ready to form and share a vision, feedback, and ideas. You will be an immediate leader on the Acquisition team.


**How You'll Make An Impact**
-----------------------------


* You'll spearhead the growth and management of our affiliate program, driving new customer acquisition and long-term retention through strategic partnerships.
* You'll source new partners, expand existing relationships, and leverage all resources (including finding new ones) to achieve the best outcomes at efficient costs via strong and mutually beneficial negotiations
* You'll oversee affiliate budget decisions and forecasting, and communicate decisions to all other channel owners.
* You'll conduct data analyses and implement innovative strategies for audience expansion and program scalability as the go-to expert for data, insights, and strategy for your channel.
* You'll collaborate closely with brand, creative, and finance teams, ensuring alignment and compliance across campaigns
* You have strong intuition and know when to follow it versus taking data at face value. You know when to dig deeper and when to socialize your hypothesis and execute.

**We're Excited About You Because**
-----------------------------------


* You have demonstrated your ability to build and manage both 0 1 and large-scale growth programs for consumer businesses.
* You thrive in high-pressure, high-stakes, and ambiguous environments. You have a natural drive to work hard. You maintain early-stage startup intensity at any scale.
* You have 3-4 years of experience managing affiliate programs, know how to allocate budgets across paid affiliate campaigns, and are able to operate autonomously
* You are proficient with affiliate platforms such as Impact Radius.
* You have experience working with a variety of publishers and sub-networks (Rakuten, Skimlinks) and are fluent with data platforms (GA4 and Looker knowledge are a plus)..
* You are well-versed in key acquisition metrics (CAC, CPL, LTV, CPA) and are comfortable using Excel and Google Sheets (including an above-average knowledge of formulas).
* You possess excellent problem-solving skills, are highly adaptable, and have the ability to prioritize daily and weekly tasks effectively.
* You are collaborative and pride yourself on your strong and effective communication skills.

**About The Growth Team**
-------------------------



We have five principles that describe our approach:


* Holistic thinking: We know that nothing exists in a silo.
* Disciplined prioritization: We need to bring perspective, clarity, and guidance to the team.
* Data-driven decision-making: We use first principles and are skeptical. We establish context.
* Proactive collaboration: We build vast common knowledge and encourage synchronous, streamlined work from our colleagues and diversity in problem-solving.
* Execute for impact: We are responsible for the growth of the business and the perception of our brand. We are resilient, accountable, and relentless.

**Office Guidelines**
---------------------



The office is open and available for all Monday through Friday. We ask all team members to be in office a minimum of 2-3 days a week to build a collaborative and invested environment to foster our unique in-person culture we are proud to have. This office policy is subject to change at company discretion.


**Our DEI Philosophy:**
-----------------------



Our company's mission is rooted in deep, genuine care for dogs – and for the people who love them. As an organization we are full of individuals who are unique in many ways, but all united in a mission of providing true peace of mind to dog lovers everywhere. Fixing this industry and improving the lives of pets and their people will be a difficult, decades-long endeavor. We believe the best use of our time, energy, and resources as a collective team is to focus on this mission, and on supporting our team to do their best work and be their best selves. In support of this we're committed to hiring and supporting a diverse workforce, and investing in internal structures, opportunities, hiring/promotions processes, and training that create and sustain an inclusive team. We strive to provide an experience at TFD that will be invested, meaningful and memorable as we progress on the journey to reimagine how we feed and care for our pets.


**A Few of Our Best Benefits**
------------------------------


* Dog-friendly office in Greenwich Village
* Market-competitive compensation and equity packages
* Comprehensive Healthcare, Dental, and Vision
* Company supported mental health benefits
* 12 week paid parental leave
* Competitive 401k plan with company match
* Flexible PTO
* Discounted fresh food for your pup
* Your pet interrupting video calls (and in-person meetings) is now a feature, not a bug


We commit to building a competitive compensation package and company environment for all individuals to thrive. We believe in competitive base compensation rooted in location specific market data and performance along with equity ownership in the company that allows every team member to build their personal wealth as the company grows, just as much as we believe in fostering a culture that supports our team members personally, professionally, and holistically. **For this role the anticipated hiring base compensation range is $115000 - $135,000 USD Annual and the compensation offered will include a robust market competitive package of base and equity.** In addition to your base compensation offer you will also receive equity ownership in the company. More information about the value of this equity will be shared at the time of offer. This range is representative of NYC Market Data if you are applying to this role outside of the NYC area the range may change.

Progressive Hydraulics, Inc. (PHI) is a family-owned and operated business with an established history in Hydraulics for over 50 years. PHI is the leading Premier Full Line Parker® Distributor in NY, NJ and CT with ParkerStore™ locations throughout the Tri-State area.

We’re growing fast, and looking for a mechanically inclined, personable and naturally helpful person to join our team as a full time **Counter Sales Associate** in our **South Plainfield, NJ ParkerStore™**.

**How we help you make the most of your skills**

We’ll provide product training and teach you about our business – the nuances of our Parker® Distributorship, fluid power (hydraulics, pneumatics and motion control) and what it takes to be a Parker® certified technician.

You naturally gravitate towards anything mechanical, which will help catapult you into a career at PHI that’ll cultivate your talents. We’ll be here to equip you with tools, knowledge and support from our Store Manager when you need it to achieve your goals.

In addition, you’ll take the initiative to provide the best service you can to help customers get their machines up and running in no time.

**What you need to bring to the table**

If you’d rather work alone on heavy equipment to avoid dealing directly with people, this isn’t the role for you. But if you like helping fellow mechanics get their machines up and running or enjoy mechanical puzzles to figure out, you’ll settle into this role just fine.

We’ll prioritize applicants who have worked on heavy equipment or in plant maintenance but we’re also willing to train the right candidate.

* **You’re mechanically inclined.** Tools, machinery and heavy equipment are in your wheelhouse – it’s where you’re the most comfortable because you can easily see how things work. Not only that, you can quickly identify what’s missing because you’re a natural observer. That’s why fixing things intrigues you – The thrill of getting something to work gives you a sense of pride and accomplishment.
* **Helping others is natural.** You’re our customer’s clutch hitter. When they come to the store, the clock is ticking and they need your help. You’re a problem solver who listens, comes up with a solution/part and follows through with the win in crucial situations. You’re also the type of person that if we can’t resolve their problem, you’ll go the extra mile to find someone who can…Because you were raised right.
* **You’re a “People Person”.** Dealing with people isn’t a problem for you because you’re personable and friendly. In fact, you enjoy being an expert they can rely on and trust.
* **Comfortable with basic math & a tape measure.** Using simple math (addition, subtraction, etc.) and a tape measure doesn’t scare you.
* **You’re Organized & Neat.**  You’re actually organized vs. saying you’re organized. In your mind, everything has its place, counter areas should be clean and merchandise should be displayed in a presentable manner.
* **You can Multi-task & lift up to 50lbs.**  You have a bunch of customers to tend to and some hose assemblies to finish for pick up. But that doesn’t phase you. In fact, you’ll greet, acknowledge and help every customer plus finish the hose assembly orders like a champ.
* **Proper Attendance.** You’re a contributor and take pride in what you do, which is why you value being punctual and showing up every day to do an outstanding job.
* **Bilingual Spanish is a Plus.** It’s not required but it could certainly be a tremendous asset.

**“So what’s in it for me,” you ask?**

At Progressive Hydraulics, Inc.we want to reward people for their contribution towards our success. We believe that the employees at PHI are family and our benefits are designed to ensure the health and financial wellness of that family.

We’re growing fast, and looking for an enthusiastic, friendly, and talented person to join our customer service team in our Fairfield, NJ office.

We provide full training on our process as well as our product ranges, and the pros and cons of different solutions. We'll also train you in how to use our case management and quoting systems.

1. **Customer service or inside sales experience**. You know how to work with customers to give and provide information needed to fulfill orders and resolve issues. A resume glowing with outstanding references and applicable experience will go a long way to securing this role.

2. **Comfortable talking on the phone.** This is a customer facing role: the way to speak with customers is over the phone and via email. You know how to sound professional and maintain your calm.

3. **You're inquisitive.** You have a passion for learning about products and can articulate them with perfection to customers.

4. **CRM and ERP Experience.** You have experience with a ticketing system and interacting with ERP systems. (Of course, we also provide training on how we use our systems).

5. **You're organized**. There's a difference between saying you're organized and actually being organized.

**“So what’s in it for me,” you ask?**

At Progressive Hydraulics, Inc.we want to reward people for their contribution towards our success. We believe that the employees at PHI are family and our benefits are designed to ensure the health and financial wellness of that family.

**Job Title:** Care Coordinator, MA (Telemedicine Programs Specialist)

  


**Location:** Morristown, NJ

  


**Type:** Full-time


**Overview**



The Care Coordinator is a critical role designed to facilitate and enhance telemedicine services, including Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) and Chronic Care Management (CCM), for patients residing in Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNF). This position serves as the pivotal link between the patients in the SNF and the remote clinical team of a third-party provider, focusing exclusively on managing and coordinating telemedicine care programs. The Care Coordinator does not perform duties within the SNF itself but rather works on behalf of a third-party company to ensure effective and successful delivery of care through telemedicine services.

  


**Responsibilities**



Act as the primary liaison between SNF patients and the remote clinical team, coordinating telemedicine services such as RPM and CCM.



Facilitate the creation and implementation of patient-centered care plans by working closely with remote healthcare providers, specifically tailored to telemedicine frameworks.



Ensure continuous monitoring and assessment of patient conditions, coordinating the flow of vital data between the SNF and the remote clinical team.



Educate and support both patients and SNF staff on the effective use of telemedicine programs, promoting optimal management of chronic conditions and healthcare outcomes.



Advocate for the patient’s needs, ensuring they receive comprehensive and effective care through the telemedicine programs.



Bridge communication and operational gaps between SNF staff and the remote clinical team to ensure seamless delivery of telemedicine services.



Manage and maintain patient records, ensuring accurate and timely communication of health data between the SNF and the remote clinical team.



Monitor and evaluate patient progress within telemedicine programs, working collaboratively with all parties to adjust care plans and interventions for better health outcomes.


**Qualifications**



Certification as a Medical Assistant or in a related healthcare field.



Experience in telemedicine, RPM, or CCM programs, with a strong understanding of care coordination within these settings.



Demonstrated ability to communicate effectively and coordinate between patients, healthcare providers, and facility staff.



Strong organizational and multitasking skills, with the capacity to manage complex care programs and detailed patient data.



Proficiency in electronic medical records (EMR) and telemedicine platforms, with a high level of digital literacy.



Knowledgeable in medical terminology, chronic condition management, and the specific requirements of telemedicine care delivery.



Independent worker with team collaboration skills, committed to enhancing patient care and outcomes through effective telemedicine coordination.


**Ideal Candidate**



The ideal candidate is a dynamic and empathetic professional, skilled in navigating the nuances of telemedicine and adept at coordinating care between remote clinical teams and patients in SNFs. This role is perfect for someone passionate about leveraging technology to improve healthcare delivery and patient outcomes in a telemedicine setting.

  


**To Apply**: Please submit your resume and a cover letter that highlights your experience with telemedicine programs, specifically RPM and CCM, and your proficiency in care coordination within these frameworks.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Morristown-Post-Acute","","","","","","","","",""

Titan is the rebel challenger in a very old industry. The present era is run by ancient players: Fidelity, Schwab, & Goldman Sachs. The problem is that none of them were built on modern rails and have horrible user experiences. There have been new things built (think: ""investing apps""). They are either 1) gimmicky casinos or 2) sleepy commodities. We won't say names. Why hasn't anyone built a modern Goldman Sachs for everyone? That's our mission.



Titan is a next-generation investment firm. We aspire to lead our generations' wealth.



We are fighters at heart. We fight to build products that are truly democratized. For example, we launched the first institutional grade cash management product open to everyday investors via Titan Smart Cash. We launched the first ever Venture fund for everyday investors in partnership with Cathie Wood's ARK. We've been able to raise significant capital from some of Silicon Valley's best, like a16z and General Catalyst.



Now let's talk about you. We're highly selective with who we choose to bring onto the team, but if you resonate with the above, we'd love to meet you.

The ideal candidate will be deeply passionate about business writing and harnessing the power of the written word to empower everyday investors with ""behind the curtain"" insights that are typically reserved for Wall Street insiders.

**What You'll Do**

* Curate, own and ship our daily newsletter to reach our audience of tens of thousands of investors and multitudes more of subscribers.
* Develop our narrative voice and the core communication practices we use to reach our engaged audience.

**Qualifications**
