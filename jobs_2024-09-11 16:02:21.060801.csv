Job Description
Lazard is one of the world’s leading financial advisory and asset management firms. Our people make the difference. With just over 3,000 employees, our tight-knit community allows for professionals eager to learn and willing to teach to connect and grow together. We believe that diversity, equity, inclusion, and allyship are not just business imperatives — they are central pillars of our employee experience. Our entrepreneurial culture and flat structure allow creative ideas and original concepts to drive our business forward — and for careers to take flight.


Through our financial advisory business, Lazard advises clients around the world on strategic and financial matters including mergers and acquisitions, restructurings, capital structure and capital raising.

We value the rich diversity that comes from blending local perspective with our global network.


The Capital Solutions team supports Lazard’s corporate and sponsor clients in capital raising efforts including private market syndication and public market execution in the context of M&A, refinancing, liability management, and new capital projects. The team’s objective is to create market-agnostic solutions for our clients: one team working with our clients to pick the best market and optimal product for their situation and executing on the company’s behalf. We work across all leveraged finance products, in both public and private markets, which will also include preferred equity and junior capital solutions. The candidate will also be exposed to private market investment grade alternatives.


As part of the Capital Solutions team, the Vice President will work with the small team with clients across all sectors and interact with Lazard bankers in every group to connect the public and private financing markets to Lazard’s clients. Candidates will receive exposure to all aspects of a financing transaction, from origination to negotiation to execution and cultivate corporate and investor relationships. The Capital Solutions team is small and nimble and is looking for a highly motivated individual to assist in our growth.

**We’ll trust you to:**

* Manage syndication processes across capital products
* Prepare and create client presentations and meeting materials
* Track market developments and transactions
* Interact with senior bankers and clients

**You’ll need to have:**

* 5-6 years of experience in capital raising capacity, ideally in the broad private/syndicated leveraged finance markets (both sellside and buyside) but open to other backgrounds
* Knowledge of sub-investment grade debt markets, debt documentation, acquisition financing, debt underwriting standards and transaction syndication process
* Experience working with investors to syndicate deals
* Strong analytical and communication skills
* Interest in broadening skillset beyond a single product in financial services

**What we offer:**


We strive to enhance the total health and well-being of our employees through comprehensive, competitive benefits. Our goal is to offer a highly individualized employee experience that enables you to balance your commitments to career, family, and community. When you work for Lazard, you are working for an organization that cares about your unique talents and passions, and will continue to invest in the development of your career.


We expect the base salary range for this role to be approximately $250,000 - $275,000 USD. Various factors contribute to determining the actual base compensation offered, including but not limited to the applicant’s years of relevant experience, career tenure, qualifications, level of education attained, certifications or other professional licenses held, and relevant skills for the role. Base salary is one component of Lazard Financial Advisory’s compensation package, which also includes comprehensive benefits and may include incentive compensation.

**Does this sound like you?**


Apply! We’ll get in touch on the next steps.

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/U--haul","http://www.uhaul.com/","2727 North Central Avenue

AWS Sales, Marketing, and Global Services (SMGS) is responsible for driving revenue, adoption, and growth from the largest and fastest growing small- and mid-market accounts to enterprise-level customers including public sector.
  
  

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 175 fully featured services from data centers globally. Millions of customers—including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies—are using AWS to lower costs, become more agile, and innovate faster.
  
  

AWS is seeking a Customer Solutions Manager (CSM) to engage directly with customers and help them realize the immense benefits derived through migrating to the cloud. This role is focused on accelerating the customer cloud journey, maximizing customer value, delivering a frictionless experience, and ensuring our customers capture the full potential and sustainable business advantages of migrating to the AWS cloud.
  
  

A CSM facilitates migration initiatives and utilizes their technical acumen, program management, organizational change management, and communication skills to influence a broad range of multidisciplinary teams - aligning sales, solution architecture, support, product, professional services, and partners to optimize customer outcomes. A CSM works with customers and AWS stakeholders to define strategic roadmaps, break them into actionable initiatives, define scope, capture and track business and technology success criteria, identify appropriate resources to execute complex technical and organizational change management plants, set goals, track and report progress, develop schedules, and communicate at all levels to deliver results. CSMs assess risks, anticipate bottlenecks, provide critical issue management, balance trade-offs, and encourage risk-taking to maximize business value. A CSM evangelizes on behalf of AWS and influences customers at an executive level to allocate appropriate resources to achieve goals. In the end, the CSM role is responsible for the alignment of cloud transformational programs (technical, operational, organizational, and educational) that span traditional IT teams and business units, to accelerate our customers’ journey to the cloud.
  
  

At AWS we value critical thinking, self-motivation, and the ability to deal with ambiguity. You should bring a cool head, extensive technical background, be detail oriented, have excellent problem solving abilities, and be an exemplary verbal and written communicator. Your technical expertise and operational excellence will influence your team’s decisions and help us drive robust customer solutions. We are passionate about people who innovate, use data to make decisions, and can express themselves thoughtfully. We want you to be passionate about delivering a great customer experience, and contributing to a team goal.
  
  

The AWS Global Support team interacts with leading companies and believes that world-class support is critical to customer success. AWS Support also partners with a global list of customers that are building mission-critical applications on top of AWS services.
  
  

**The successful candidate will:**  

* Demonstrate excellent customer service skills through all levels of an organization.
* Maintain an in-depth knowledge and understanding of existing and developing technologies as it relates to cloud computing, to unlock opportunities for customers.
* Possess a strong background in change management and incorporating organizational change best practices seamlessly into project delivery.
* Accelerate customer adoption through education and engagement.
* Assist customers in identifying use cases for priority adoption of AWS as well as best practice implementations.
* Assist in developing long-term strategic relationships with key accounts.

**Work Where It’s Best for You**
--------------------------------


Work Anywhere means you can work in an office or at home on any given day. It’s about getting the work done in the way and place that works best for each person. This applies across all locations and departments.



Work Anywhere does not mean work at any time. We have predictable core hours where employees are generally available for meetings and collaboration. Employees are focused and available during core hours.



We invest in our offices to make them places where our employees like to go. If you work in the office three or more days a week, you will have a dedicated office workspace. Our offices function as hubs to draw people in, create social bonds, and where random connections and mixing of ideas happen. We’re investing more in offices, culture, and offsite meetings, not less.



Product teams are organized in regional product hubs for optimal collaboration and live within a time zone of their hub. Our current product hubs are located in Pleasanton, Columbus, Boston, Kansas City, New York City, Raleigh, and Toronto. We create opportunities for teams to get together in person regularly.



Customer-facing roles, such as Sales and Professional Services, live near and/or travel to their customers.



When an employee moves within a country it does not cause a change in salary. Where you live impacts you and your family. Not knowing if your compensation will change if you move can cause stress and uncertainty for everyone. We wanted to eliminate that.

**Work Where It’s Best for You**
--------------------------------


Work Anywhere means you can work in an office or at home on any given day. It’s about getting the work done in the way and place that works best for each person. This applies across all locations and departments.



Work Anywhere does not mean work at any time. We have predictable core hours where employees are generally available for meetings and collaboration. Employees are focused and available during core hours.



We invest in our offices to make them places where our employees like to go. If you work in the office three or more days a week, you will have a dedicated office workspace. Our offices function as hubs to draw people in, create social bonds, and where random connections and mixing of ideas happen. We’re investing more in offices, culture, and offsite meetings, not less.



Product teams are organized in regional product hubs for optimal collaboration and live within a time zone of their hub. Our current product hubs are located in Pleasanton, Columbus, Boston, Kansas City, New York City, Raleigh, and Toronto. We create opportunities for teams to get together in person regularly.



Customer-facing roles, such as Sales and Professional Services, live near and/or travel to their customers.



When an employee moves within a country it does not cause a change in salary. Where you live impacts you and your family. Not knowing if your compensation will change if you move can cause stress and uncertainty for everyone. We wanted to eliminate that.

Work Anywhere means you can work in an office or at home on any given day. It’s about getting the work done in the way and place that works best for each person. This applies across all locations and departments.



Work Anywhere does not mean work at any time. We have predictable core hours where employees are generally available for meetings and collaboration. Employees are focused and available during core hours.



We invest in our offices to make them places where our employees like to go. If you work in the office three or more days a week, you will have a dedicated office workspace. Our offices function as hubs to draw people in, create social bonds, and where random connections and mixing of ideas happen. We’re investing more in offices, culture, and offsite meetings, not less.



Product teams are organized in regional product hubs for optimal collaboration and live within a time zone of their hub. Our current product hubs are located in Pleasanton, Columbus, Boston, Kansas City, New York City, Raleigh, and Toronto. We create opportunities for teams to get together in person regularly.



Customer-facing roles, such as Sales and Professional Services, live near and/or travel to their customers.



When an employee moves within a country it does not cause a change in salary. Where you live impacts you and your family. Not knowing if your compensation will change if you move can cause stress and uncertainty for everyone. We wanted to eliminate that.

**Work Where It’s Best for You**
--------------------------------


Work Anywhere means you can work in an office or at home on any given day. It’s about getting the work done in the way and place that works best for each person. This applies across all locations and departments.



Work Anywhere does not mean work at any time. We have predictable core hours where employees are generally available for meetings and collaboration. Employees are focused and available during core hours.



We invest in our offices to make them places where our employees like to go. If you work in the office three or more days a week, you will have a dedicated office workspace. Our offices function as hubs to draw people in, create social bonds, and where random connections and mixing of ideas happen. We’re investing more in offices, culture, and offsite meetings, not less.



Product teams are organized in regional product hubs for optimal collaboration and live within a time zone of their hub. Our current product hubs are located in Pleasanton, Columbus, Boston, Kansas City, New York City, Raleigh, and Toronto. We create opportunities for teams to get together in person regularly.



Customer-facing roles, such as Sales and Professional Services, live near and/or travel to their customers.



When an employee moves within a country it does not cause a change in salary. Where you live impacts you and your family. Not knowing if your compensation will change if you move can cause stress and uncertainty for everyone. We wanted to eliminate that.
