The Bureau of Equitable Health Systems (BEHS) is the healthcare systems bureau of DOHMH situated within CHECW and supporting the strategic plan and vision of the Chief Medical Officer. Our mission is to apply policy, evidence, and practical expertise to improve equity in health care delivery at the individual, organizational, financing, and systems levels. We aim to operationalize the Board of Health's resolution of Racism as a Public Health Crisis by addressing structural racism and intersectional inequities embedded within the healthcare delivery system. The mortality experienced due to COVID-19 made visible the inequities that many New Yorkers experience in accessing the healthcare system; as well as the marginalization of essential health workers.
  

  

As we move forward towards an equitable COVID-19 recovery, we need to develop innovative solutions to improve the performance, equity, and efficiency of the healthcare delivery system. BEHS includes the Office of Health Insurance Services (OHIS), which provides community-facing programs and on-the ground programmatic work that maximizes health insurance coverage opportunities and increases access to healthcare and social support services such as assistance with SNAP applications to address food insecurities for all New Yorkers. OHIS has a few high priority community initiatives to roll out and has partnered with the Mayor's Office of Immigrant Affairs (MOAI), New York City Human Resources Administration (HRA), New York City Department for the Aging (DFTA) and Community Based Organizations to assist the uninsured; aged (65 years or older); certified blind; and certified disabled populations residing in the five boroughs through health insurance related education, outreach, and enrollment assistance.
  

  

To ensure full compliance of these partnerships, the Bureau of Equity Health Systems seeks to hire a bilingual College Aide to work from our Morrisania Health Center Site.
  

  

DUTIES WILL INCLUDE BUT NOT BE LIMITED TO:

Our AI-powered platform was purpose-built for medical conversations, improving clinical documentation efficiencies while enabling clinicians to focus on what matters most—their patients.


Our enterprise-grade technology transforms patient-clinician conversations into structured clinical notes in real-time, with deep EMR integrations. Powered by Linked Evidence and our purpose-built, auditable AI, we are the only company that maps AI-generated summaries to ground truth, helping providers quickly trust and verify the output. As pioneers in generative AI for healthcare, we are setting the industry standards for the responsible deployment of AI across health systems.


We are a growing team of practicing MDs, AI scientists, PhDs, creatives, technologists, and engineers working together to empower people and make care make more sense.

**The Role**
------------


We’re looking for someone to lead the Information Technology function that enables our growing US-based team to develop, sell, and support our generative AI-powered products that bring joy back to the practice of medicine.

**What You'll Do**
------------------

* Oversee the procurement and provisioning of devices, including computers, mobile phones, and other hardware, ensuring they meet the company's standards for security and functionality.
* Manage the implementation and maintenance of Mobile Device Management (MDM) systems to ensure the security and compliance of company devices.
* Manage all aspects of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications, including user onboarding and offboarding, license management, and vendor relationships.
* Automate manual processes and improve efficiency wherever possible.
* Collaborate with cross-functional teams to identify, plan, and deliver the IT projects required to support our growth. This role may require occasional travel to set up and support US-based offices.
* Develop and implement IT policies and procedures to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and industry standards. You will be responsible for keeping complete, regularly updated, and accurate records.
* Build a service desk function to support team members needing hardware and software support.
* Provide leadership and guidance to ensure the security of our IT systems and data, including vulnerability management, incident response, and disaster recovery planning.

**What You’ll Bring**
---------------------

* 7+ years of experience in IT leadership roles, with a proven track record of success in managing complex IT environments. You have built an IT function at a fast-growing startup.
* Experienced working in a regulated environment. You have implemented compliance frameworks such as SOC2 and HITRUST.
* Experienced with endpoint management solutions for both Mac + Windows. We are primarily Mac-based, and you must have several years of experience supporting a fleet of Apple hardware. You probably have some strong opinions about tools like JAMF and Addigy.
* Passionate about technology, with expertise in areas such as network infrastructure, cloud computing, cybersecurity, and IT service management.
* A fantastic communicator who collaborates effectively with stakeholders at all levels of the organization.
* Excited about being hands-on in a fast-moving, productive, and supportive environment.
* Willing to pitch in wherever needed. As a fast-moving startup, we need to do good work quickly.
* Relevant certifications (e.g., CISSP, CISM, ITIL) are a plus.


We value people who want to learn new things, and we know that great team members might not perfectly match a job description. If you’re interested in the role but aren’t sure whether or not you’re a good fit, we’d still like to hear from you.

**Must be willing to work from our SF or NYC office 2-3x/week**


We seek candidates based in or willing to relocate to the San Francisco Bay Area and/or the New York Tri-State area. This position requires a commitment to a hybrid work model, with the expectation of coming into the office 2-3 times per week.

**Must be willing to travel up to 10%**


Abridge typically hosts a three-day builder team retreat every three to six months. These retreats often feature internal hackathons, collaborative project sessions, and social events that allow the team to connect.

**Why Work at Abridge?**
------------------------

* Be a part of a trailblazing, mission driven organization that uses audio as the wedge to improve the healthcare delivery experience
* Unlimited PTO for salaried team members, plus 12 national holidays
* Comprehensive and generous benefits package:
* 16 weeks paid parental leave, for all employees

* Plus much more!

**Life at Abridge**
-------------------


At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.


Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

**Diversity & Inclusion**
-------------------------


Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

**Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud**
----------------------------------------------------------


We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process. Any emails from the Abridge recruiting team will come from an @abridge.com email address. You can learn more about how to protect yourself from these types of fraud by referring to this article.
