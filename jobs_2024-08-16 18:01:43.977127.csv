Important Information
FINRA’s Code of Conduct imposes restrictions on employees’ investments and requires financial disclosures that are uniquely related to our role as a securities regulator.

All of those accounts are subject to the Code’s investment and securities account restrictions, and new employees must comply with those investment restrictions—including disposing of any security issued by a company on FINRA’s Prohibited Company List or obtaining a written waiver from their Executive Vice President—by the date they begin employment with FINRA. Employees may only maintain securities accounts that must be disclosed to FINRA at one or more securities firms that provide an electronic feed (e-feed) of data to FINRA, and must move securities accounts from other securities firms to a firm that provides an e-feed within three months of beginning employment.

Team Wilderness is a nonprofit organization that uses an experiential educational model to teach urban youth teamwork, leadership, and character.

The organization helps to promote confidence in youth, consideration for their peers, passion for the world they live in, and resilience both as an individual and a group. Facing physical and social challenges, they learn to adapt and develop real-life problem-solving skills while at the same time overcoming fears and obstacles. We are the only wilderness experiential education organization offering programs focusing specifically on Hudson County's most underserved youth. Our programs are affordable for all income levels; since they cater to the youth from the community, they help positively impact the community itself.

Our programming includes opportunities for youth to experience mentorship, tutoring, nature photography, academic coaching, and mental health support. One hundred percent of the youth in our programs are residents of Hudson County and nearly 80% are free or reduced lunch recipients.

**Program Description**  
Our Academic Coaching program - Compass Project - was born out of an awareness that many of our youth have been in need of extra support and guidance in relation to their academic goals and aspirations. This program’s mission is to support youth with implementing and maintaining skills, confidence and motivation gained from outdoor excursions into their academic life and overall well being. We tend to focus on youth in their final years of high school and are beginning to open it up to youth in their first years of college. We encourage youth to strive towards academic excellence and seek to increase their knowledge about the interconnectedness of overall well being and academic performance. Participants receive 30-45 min coaching sessions on a bi-weekly basis along with 15-20 minute check-ins during alternate weeks. These longer sessions take place via video or phone and the shorter check-ins take place via text or phone.

An example of academic themes that may be explored within the program include but are not limited to:

* Low grades/failing classes
* Procrastination
* Time management
* Goal setting
* College applications
* Transitioning into higher ed

Youth will experience monthly outdoor trips where they will be able to build bonds with their peers and experience firsthand how wilderness activities can help them reflect on and navigate challenges experienced in academia/school. Compass project runs from September - June of each school year. The program is limited to 22 participants at a time.

**Position Description**  
This is a part-time position ranging from 7-10 hours depending on the student caseload. The academic coach will be responsible for facilitating a safe and inclusive environment in their 1 on 1 meetings with youth and in outdoor trips utilizing empathy and active listening. The coach will report to the Principal Counselor and/or the Programming Director. The coach will engage in bi-weekly 30-45 minute virtual supervision meetings to discuss challenges, concerns, and provide feedback on experience with youth. The coach will be able to work after school hours between 4:00 PM - 8:00 PM EST.

The coach will be responsible for meeting with youth on a bi-weekly basis for 30-45 minutes. The coach will facilitate discussion around academic challenges and aspirations. The coach will guide youth in developing S.M.A.R.T. goals and assist youth with developing awareness of learning styles utilizing the VARK questionnaire. Coaches will also check in with youth via text for 20 minutes on the off-weeks, creating a space of accountability and commitment to youth’s identified goals. The coach will also be responsible for administering a monthly questionnaire to assess for youth’s expectancy-value-cost regarding challenging classes/subjects. In addition, each marking period, the coach is required to collect youth’s report cards in order to assess for increases, decreases, or stabilization of grades in challenging classes.

Ideally the coach will also join the youth and TW staff on the monthly hikes and outings. These trips involve social and emotional reflection that help youth connect the trip to the academic challenges they may be experiencing. Trips typically involve a 3-4 mile hike over a four hour trip to a park. Trips may also include kayaking and rock climbing (indoor or outdoor). Hiking trips typically occur within a one hour drive or less of Hudson County.

**Dates/Hours**  
September to June. Flexible hours during after school hours and weekends. Trips are on weekends or during days when there's no school (Election Day, MLK Day...)

Position Profile

**About the Opportunity**

**Write the Next Chapter at New York Theatre Workshop** 

New York Theatre Workshop (NYTW), a community of artists and audience members seeking to better understand the world through theatre, stands as an inspiring pillar in the New York City, national, and international theatre ecosystem. After a tremendous period of growth and achievement—having fostered the careers of ground-breaking artists, installed a visionary new Artistic Director, and mounted numerous Tony and Obie award winning productions—NYTW continues to be a powerful leader in the creation and production of theatre for artists and audiences alike. From the acclaimed Broadway and West End-bound productions such as Hadestown, Merrily We Roll Along, and the iconic Rent, to the intimate and boundary-pushing pieces, such as On Sugarland and Here There Are Blueberries, under Artistic Director Patricia McGregor’s leadership, NYTW’s commitment to rigor, risk, and a range of theatrical styles and artists remains paramount. NYTW audiences engage in dialogue and active learning not just through its productions, but through a varied set of educational and community engagement programs designed to deepen the impact of NYTW’s artistic work on intergenerational audiences and participants.

**WHO ARE WE**


Generator is on a journey. Appropriate, given that we're a shared accommodation lifestyle brand. The journey began in London, swung through a heap of European capitals on its way to dominating the world. Generator burst onto the scene in the Americas with the launch of Generator Miami and Washington DC and most recently took aim at the country’s biggest markets (NYC, LA, Miami and Chicago) with the acquisition of Freehand Hotels.


No biggie. Fast Company named us one of the top 50 most innovative global companies. We, of course, agree.


Our spaces are safe and seriously social, in the proudest part of the beating heart of the cities we love. Cultural action, creative pulse and an outstanding way to waste some of the finite time the universe has given you - that's what Generator offers. Holds true for staff and visitors equally, and while chic design is always the backdrop, every Generator in every destination reflects the unique beat of that city's heart.

**ABOUT PARAMOUNT HOTEL NEW YORK**


Paramount Hotel is a New York City landmark located just steps from Times Square. Constructed in the French Renaissance style by Thomas W. Lamb in 1927, the building reflects the theatrical character of its neighborhood. The bustle of the street disappears as you step inside - with its two-story lobby, reflective fireplace, dramatic lighting, and rich textures, it sets the stage for a hip, indulgent experience. Recently updated but retaining its historical charm, the Paramount Hotel is standing out – as the only hotel near Broadway NYC with genuine personality.


Kind of a “no brainer” to take this iconic hotel with us on our Generator journey.
