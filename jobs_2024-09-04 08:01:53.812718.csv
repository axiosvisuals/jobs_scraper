Our deli clerks are weighed by their ability to serve customers. They're responsible for maintaining deli cases, slicing up meats and cheeses and preparing other products. They share their expertise with customers by offering them great meal options and helping them find exactly what they're looking for. This is just a general overview of their job duties. You may be asked to assist in other ways too, depending on the needs of your store.
