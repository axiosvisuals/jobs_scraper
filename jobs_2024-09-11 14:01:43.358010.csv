Como la propiedad de lujo original, St. Regis continúa redefiniendo el lujo moderno a través del servicio. Uno de los aspectos fundamentales es el programa de camareros, un ícono de nuestra herencia y el corazón y el alma del nuevo lujo. Es personalizado, adaptado, creativo y original. Cobra vida gracias a todos los talentos, pero la cara principal del programa es nuestro equipo de camareros, quienes son los principales embajadores del lujo.

  

Los camareros brindan servicios y experiencias personalizados en las residencias que satisfacen las necesidades de los huéspedes mientras viven allí. En el caso de propiedades ubicadas junto a otras, esto incluye coordinar y verificar que los departamentos del hotel que respaldan los servicios de los camareros también estén equipados para satisfacer las necesidades de los huéspedes. Los camareros son clave para entablar relaciones con los huéspedes, anticipar de manera proactiva sus necesidades y actuar en consonancia cuando sea posible.

  

Si bien la marca St. Regis está repleta de historia con raíces que se remontan a los comienzos del siglo XX, cada miembro del equipo es parte de un futuro innovador para redefinir el lujo moderno a través del servicio. Para que un camarero sea exitoso debe tener una gran pasión por el servicio, estándares inflexibles, la capacidad de anticipar las necesidades y aptitudes interpersonales impecables.

  

También se esperará que usted cree un lugar de trabajo seguro, cumpla con las políticas y los procedimientos de la compañía, mantenga los estándares de calidad y se asegure de que su uniforme, apariencia personal y manera de comunicarse sean profesionales. Los miembros del equipo de camareros estarán de pie y moviéndose de un sitio a otro (estar parado, sentado o caminando durante largos periodos) y tendrán un papel activo en el trabajo (mover, levantar, cargar, empujar, jalar y colocar objetos de hasta 22.7 kg [50 lb] sin ayuda). Es fundamental que los miembros del equipo de camareros hagan siempre bien esas tareas (y otras tareas razonables que se les solicite) para que los huéspedes estén satisfechos y el hotel funcione de manera correcta siempre.
