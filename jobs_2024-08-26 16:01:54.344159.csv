* We aren’t big on stress. So, while we will expect you to work efficiently and get things done, we focus on open communication, transparency, and getting things done right the first go around.
* The hours are super flexible. We will work with your schedule to get a routine that works for you. Rather work mid morning until mid afternoon? Cool, we can do that too. (For example, Monday – Friday 10-2, 11-3, 12-4)

Now, let’s talk about the job requirements:

* You need to be the type of person who gets joy out of getting things done, creating processes, and owning tasks.
* You will be on the computer a lot. So, an understanding of EHR’s, insurance/billing, email (specifically G Suite), navigating the web, and other computer based stuff will be necessary.
* You will be on the phone a lot. So, you need to enjoy talking with people and giving/getting direction.
* You need to be a person who loves to deliver remarkable experiences to other people. You know, you need to be someone who feels good by making other people feel good, after all we are in the business of helping people.
* We want you to be meticulous in your work. We are looking for a good, fun person, who gets things done.

In addition to being a detailed person, you must follow systems and processes. In fact, just to prove that you are detailed oriented and can follow procedures, when you apply for this position please also send an email through the ""*contact us*"" tab at www.longislandbehavioralhealth.com , in the subject line of the email you must include “I have found my type of peeps”. Yep, that’s our little trick to sort out the people who blanket send their resume to anyone and everyone, from the folks (that’s you) who are truly interested in this position.

**About Hook & Reel:**

Born in the South where a feast means getting messy with friends, the seafood boil has been bringing people together for ages. At Hook & Reel our signature boil forks over bold flavors with a genuine, down-home feel.

But eating seafood is only part of the fun. Everything tastes better elbow-to-elbow with friends, swapping stories over music, getting down and dirty and eating with your hands – all with a cold drink at the ready, ‘cause that spice ain’t no joke. We set out to share the saucy spirit of the boil with folks everywhere – testing our very own recipes, inspired by fiery Cajun home cooking. The Hook & Reel seafood boil dishes up the “reel” deal – the full backyard boil experience and flavor, with a twist.

It’s a party, so we always laugh loud, and eat big.
