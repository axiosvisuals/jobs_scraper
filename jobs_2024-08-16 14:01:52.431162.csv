Manager, Product Manager - Retail Bank
 At Capital One, we believe great products begin with a deep understanding of our customers. From our earliest days, we pioneered the use of predictive modeling to individually personalize credit card offers, turning the entire industry on its head. As we’ve grown bigger, we’ve found more and more ways to use technology and face-to-face conversations to understand the human problems associated with money and finances.


In the Consumer Bank, we’ve combined this human-centered approach with our heritage of data-driven decision making to design, build, and test our way to truly enabling financial experiences. We’ve challenged ourselves to spend less time planning, more time doing, and, above all else, to see the world through the eyes of our customers as they work to understand and manage their money.


Are you passionate about improving the way people interact with their money? Are you driven by the delight you bring to customers? Are you interested in how complex data is imaged from letters and converted into workable needs? Do you keep asking “why” until you hit the root? It’s common to fall in love with solutions, but have you ever fallen in love with the problem? Do you have an opinion on whether shipping is more important than perfection? Do you have a healthy dose of skepticism for the impossible? If you’re nodding your head, then we want you!


As a Product Manager focusing on our Case Experience platform you will be reimagining our associate, customer and 3rd party experiences. You will be in the driver seat for platform services that impact a range of needs including money movement and document processing. As part of our Core Case Platform team, you will have the opportunity to partner with cross-functional teams to improve business processes and customer experiences across Capital One.

 **On any given day in the Bank you’ll be:**

* Empowered. Part of a team driving document imaging, internal money movement and check processing, along with driving other extensible services for case management
* Learning constantly. Work deeply with customers, associates, designers, technologists, and data scientists to build cutting edge solutions
* Innovating relentlessly. Pushing big change by asking bold questions; starting small, testing, and learning your way to something dramatically better
* Sharing openly. Telling stories that change the way people think about building products and solving problems, and that illustrate the power of what software can do to make them even better
* Connecting creatively. Jumpstarting a self-supporting community by sowing the right seeds, building the right tools, integrating the right off-the-shelf products, and just plain elbow grease
* Succeeding strategically. Solving the right problem and holding on the wrong one

**Here is what you will bring to the table:**

* Curious. You ask why, you explore, you're not afraid to blurt out your crazy idea, or follow an email chain for weeks to find someone with an answer.
* Do-er. You have a bias toward action, you try things, and sometimes you fail. You dug up a hidden feature in an API that let you do something really cool or introduced a new routine that broke down silos that led to better decisions.
* Passionate. You care about growing others and bringing them together around what’s possible. You’ve started meetup groups or taught General Assembly courses because you love enabling others.
* Communicator. You can communicate complex ideas clearly, your team knows their priorities and why they’re doing what they’re doing. Maybe you’re an introvert, or maybe you’re an extrovert, but nobody accuses you of keeping them out of the loop.
* Wrangler. You’ve gotten back-end engineers to play nice with iOS developers, you can inspire an ETL developer to write creatively about their latest pipeline.
* Fearless. Big, undefined problems don't frighten you. You can work at a tiny crack until you've broken open the whole nut. You are comfortable saying no.

**Here is what we will bring to the table:**

* Competitive salary and equity (including a robust 401(k) plan)
* Excellent medical and dental insurance (and other health benefits)
* Superstar product, design, data, and engineering leaders [Paypal, Google, Gilt, Yodle, AOL, Adaptive Path]
* Top class engineering teams that you will lead and build product alongside
* Continuous learning budget
* Highly supportive and “bought in” leadership environment

**Basic Qualifications:**

* At least 3 years of experience working with cross-functional teams to deliver consumer experiences.
* At least 3 years of experience working on the core product platforms that power digital experiences
* At least 3 years of digital industry experience for consumers
* Bachelor’s Degree or military experience

**Preferred Qualifications:**

* At least 3 years of experience with web and client-side mobile platforms
* At least 2 years of experience as a Product Owner in an Agile development process
* MBA or Master’s degree
