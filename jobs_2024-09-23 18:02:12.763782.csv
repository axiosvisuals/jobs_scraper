The Center for Justice Innovation is a community justice organization that centers safety and racial justice. Since our founding in 1996, the Center has partnered with community members, courts, and the people most impacted to create stronger, healthier, more just communities. Our decades of experience in courts and communities, coupled with our field-leading research and practitioner expertise, help us drive justice nationwide in innovative, powerful, and durable ways. For more information on how and where we work, please visit www.innovatingjustice.org.


The Center is a 900-employee, $100 million nonprofit that accomplishes its vision through three pillars of work: creating and scaling operating programs to test new ideas and solve problems, performing original research to determine what works (and what doesn’t), and providing expert assistance and policy guidance to justice reformers around the world.

**Operating Programs**


The Center’s operating programs, including the award-winning Red Hook Community Justice Center and Midtown Community Court, test new ideas, solve difficult problems, and attempt to achieve systemic change within the justice system. Our projects include community-based violence prevention programs, alternatives to incarceration, reentry initiatives, and court-based initiatives that reduce the use of unnecessary incarceration and promote positive individual and family change. Through this programming, we have produced tangible results like safer streets, reduced incarceration, and improved neighborhood perceptions of justice.

**Research**


The Center's research teams are staffed with social scientists, data analysts, and lawyers who are academically-trained or have lived experience and who conduct research in the U.S. and globally on diverse criminal-legal system and justice issues. Their work includes evaluating programs and policies; conducting exploratory, community-based studies; and providing research translation and strategic planning for system actors. The Center has published studies on topics including court and jail reform, intimate partner violence, restorative justice, gun violence, reentry, sixth amendment rights, and progressive prosecution. The research teams strive to make their work meaningful and actionable to the communities they work with, policymakers, and practitioners.

**Policy & Expert Assistance**


The Center provides hands-on, planning and implementation assistance to a wide range of jurisdictions in areas of reform such as problem-solving courts (e.g., community courts, treatment courts, domestic violence courts), tribal justice, reducing incarceration and the use of fines/fees and reducing crime and violence. Our current expert assistance takes many forms, including help with analyzing data, strategic planning and consultation, policy guidance, and hosting site visits to its operating programs in the New York City area.

Intrigued?**   
\\*\\*  
\\*\\*  
Busting bugs has its benefits. Company-provided truck, gas, and phone. Benefits including a 401(k) with a company match. But it’s more than that. It’s serving with a smile. It’s having your teammates’ backs. It’s going above and beyond and making a difference. We step in and step up when people have problems they can’t fix, and they need the pros. We crush their pest problems and lift their spirits.

Back to you. Are you a hard worker? Can you follow direction, adapt to change, and solve problems? Are you organized, friendly, and motivated to succeed? That’s a great place to start.

**As a Pest Control Technician, here’s what you can expect** 

* You won’t be tied to a desk. You’ll be out and about — mobile, independent, and growing your career with a clear view of next steps. You’ll be the face of Terminix to your local community (with the backing of a national brand), and your clients will count on you to protect their businesses, their homes, and their families.
* When you first join Terminix Nation, you’ll spend a few months in training. Once you’ve got that and some state required licenses and certificates under your belt, you’ll take the lead with your own customers.
* You’ll get rewarded with competitive pay and robust benefits to cover you and your family. As a teammate, you will be eligible for a 401(k) with company match, company-paid life insurance, tuition reimbursement, and a generous student loan repayment program. You put in the work, and you’ll reap the rewards.
* You’ll be part of a community — bonus points if you’re already a leader in yours. Our bonds are strong at Terminix Nation and the relationships we develop in the communities we serve are unparalleled. Our teammates give back through volunteering, donations, scholarships, and more.
* You’ll be onboarded and trained by the best of ‘em. You’ll get paid to get licensed, something you’ll have for a lifetime. You’ll know how to bust bugs at home, too.

**What your days will look like**

* Roll up your sleeves and get ready to learn how we take care of customers. You’ll become an expert in applying our company products so they’re safe and effective.
* Are you a good driver? As a technician, your office is the cab of your Terminix truck. You’ll use it on calls and take it home, too. Same goes for your Terminix phone. We trust our technicians.
* You’ll be responsible for building relationships with customers, scheduling and confirming their appointments, helping with sales to current customers, and expanding our product to new customers.
* Does technology scare you? That’s okay. We provide training and support to ensure you’re comfortable using state-of-the-art tools. You’ll also need to have strong communication skills so that you can email, text, call, talk, and write effectively. Oh, and sometimes there’s paperwork.
* There’s an opportunity to grow into a role you’re passionate about and fits your skillset — whether that’s management, a move to sales, or another opportunity at Terminix.

**Some non-negotiables**  
There are some things you’ll just need to have or know to join Terminix Nation as a Pest Control Technician.

* High school diploma or GED; or one to three months related experience and/or training; or equivalent combination of education and experience.
* Solid reading, writing, and verbal communication skills and the ability to present information in both internal and external settings.
* Some basic math skills — add, subtract, multiply, and divide in all units of measure, using whole numbers, common fractions, and decimals. You’ll need to be able to follow instructions for mixing on product labels.
* With the help of Terminix (and with the company footing the bill), you’ll need to maintain the licenses/certificates as required by federal, state, and/or local regulations.
* Valid driver’s license in current state of residence.

**Straight talk about the physical demands of our work**

We’re not going to sugarcoat it. The essential functions of this job have some physical demands (of course, reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the essential functions.) Here’s what we mean:

* You’ve got to be able to move up to 10 lbs. regularly and 11–20 lbs. frequently, whether that’s lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, or otherwise repositioning objects.
* You’ll move around a lot — regularly sitting, climbing, balancing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, and crawling. You’ll go up and down stairs, ladders, scaffolding, ramps, and poles. And you’ll need to keep your balance when walking, standing, or crouching on narrow, slippery, or moving surfaces. (You’ll definitely get your steps in.)
* You must be able to safely operate a motor vehicle and make sure it and all other equipment is kept clean.
* The vision to perform detail-oriented activities at distances close to the eyes or within arm’s reach.
* Sometimes you’ll need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE), like an OSHA-compliant respirator.

**Work conditions**  
Pests don’t always live in nice places — and that’s where we do our work. But don’t worry – we’ll prepare you with all you need to do the work as safely and as comfortably as possible.

* You’ll need to be able to work both inside and outside in your local climate in company-provided weather gear.
* You’ll sometimes be working around mechanical parts, vehicles, electrical current, heights and scaffolding, fumes, dust, and chemicals, and we’ll train you how to handle all of these conditions safely.
* This is kind of a no-brainer — you’ll be around animals and insects.
* And you’ll have to be okay with working in tight, confined spaces, narrow aisles, or passageways — like you might find in crawl spaces. We work where the critters live.

To join Terminix Nation, you’ll need to meet state and federal regulations and company safety requirements.

Introduction
At GAF, we cover more than buildings. We cover each other. No matter what role, tenure, or track, under this roof you are empowered to be there for your teammates, your customers, and especially your community. Under this roof, we don’t back down from hard work– we support one another in pursuit of something bigger. We define the future while leading the present. And under this roof, we own our opportunities. Becoming the market leader only happens when everyone feels they have the opportunity, and the support, to thrive. We are GAF. And under this roof, we protect what matters most.
Summary
The Supply Chain Planner will play a key role in servicing GAF’s customers through the integrated supply and demand planning of manufactured and purchased finished goods. This planning includes making recommendations in Demand/Supply Balancing Meetings as part of the monthly Sales & Operations Planning process, creating Master Production Schedules, Capacity Planning, and Demand planning for their respective service area. The Supply Chain Planner will also develop distribution plans with Supply Chain Operations to move product throughout the network to service demand and support inventory build strategies. This position requires an integrated planning mindset that will drive key business results for the company across the supply chain and manufacturing. The Supply Chain Planner will be responsible for determining and influencing optimal production hours, plant crewing, finished good network sourcing, and inventory volumes. In addition, the Supply Chain Planner is responsible for demand planning and forecasting of finished goods for the area which they support. This position will be strongly integrated within Supply Chain and will work closely with Demand Planning, Logistics, and Procurement, as well as Plant Logistics, Manufacturing, Sales, and Customer Care to ensure that sales opportunities are met in a timely and cost-effective way. The planner will be expected to fully understand the Supply Chain Metrics he/she influences, and take action to drive improvement toward the metrics.
Essential Duties
Specific responsibilities include, but are not limited to:* 25% Master Planning and Inventory Planning. This will involve deep understanding, systematic set-up, and maintenance of the JDA system. Master planning typically occurs weekly and will require close involvement with the production scheduler at the manufacturing facility. The Supply Chain Planner will be expected to review the master plans regularly and make adjustments if needed to balance inventory with demand and maintain service levels. An integrated approach to this role is critical to understand the impact of the plant operation, raw material supply, customer orders, transportation, and warehousing. The Supply Chain Planner will balance inventory and production plans across products based on demand to ensure optimal service levels; reduce slow-moving, obsolete, and off-spec finished goods material (SMOOSI) and administer the appropriate actions to reduce exposure to GAF.
* 30% Demand Planning and Forecasting. The Supply Chain Planner will be responsible for maintaining the demand for finished goods items in JDA for the area that they plan. This requires an integrated planning approach, analytics skills, and close collaboration with Sales and Manufacturing to ensure the optimal supply of finished goods are produced. The Supply Chain Planner will collaborate monthly with Sales to review and revise the annual forecast which is updated and maintained in JDA. This will involve deep understanding, systematic set-up, and maintenance of the JDA system.
* 25% Distribution Replenishment Planning. This will involve deep understanding, systematic set-up, and maintenance of the JDA system. The Supply Chain Planner will be tasked to understand its product offering - what areas of the country is/can the product be sold in and why. This will require integration with Sales, Marketing, and Advanced Analytics. The Supply Chain Planner is expected to ensure their products are distributed in the most cost-effective manner and stocked throughout the network in stocking locations. The Supply Chain Planner should be making recommendations on stocking quantities and locations based on demand, and working with Sales, Supply Chain Operations, and Advanced Analytics on the decisions, and ensuring systematic set-up reflects this.
* 20% Demand/Supply Balancing. With the use of the JDA planning system, the Supply Chain Planner will be expected to make recommendations on crewing, production hours, and inventory levels to meet demand and optimally service our customers and provide value to GAF for the plants in their service area.

The Director of Compensation is a hybrid role which consists of a combination of in person and remote work.


KIPP TEAM & Family is our network office that includes support teams - such as Leadership Development, Recruitment, Advocacy, Facilities, Finance, HR and more - dedicated to empowering our schools and ensuring the success of KIPP students throughout New Jersey and Miami. Our schools are part of the nationally recognized “Knowledge Is Power Program” network of free, open-enrollment, college-preparatory public schools dedicated to preparing students for success in college and in life. The first KIPP New Jersey school opened in Newark in 2002 and since then our school network has expanded to educate 8,135 students in grades K-12. By 2027, KIPP New Jersey will provide a world-class education to over 10,300 students across Newark and Camden. To learn more, visit www.kippnj.org.


In 2018, we grew our KIPP community in response to a need for high-quality school options for students in Greater Miami’s Urban Core communities. That led to the creation of KIPP Miami, which currently educates more than 1,000 students in four schools, with plans to reach 5,800 students by 2025. By offering highly effective educators with strong bonds to families, more time in school learning, services that support a variety of student needs, and a culture focused on achievement, our students in New Jersey and Miami are on the path to and through college, career, and choice-filled lives.

 **Job Description** **Here’s what you need to know:**


At KIPP NJ and KIPP Miami, Achievement Directors serve first as members of our K-12 multi-city Teaching & Learning TEAM, and then as leaders of their discipline in the academic program. Using best practices, standards knowledge, vertical thinking, input and feedback from a wide range of stakeholders, and an equity lens for developing content, Achievement Directors develop and manage our curriculum and assessment model, with the goal of improving long-term learning for kids. In addition to managing curriculum and assessments, Achievement Directors are responsible for increasing the instructional leadership capacity of school-based leaders (including Heads of Schools, School Leaders, and Assistant Principals) by deepening everyone’s subject matter expertise and modeling and coaching the instructional power moves.


This is a multi-city role that will require ~2-3 days per week in-person in our Newark high schools, and ~1-2 days per week in-person at our high school in Camden, NJ.


Specifically, Achievement Directors are responsible for driving academic achievement and growth on:

* State and standardized tests (NJGPA/NJSLA, FSA, STAR, ACT)
* Internal assessments (i-Ready, F&P, unit-level tests, midterms, finals)


The High School Literacy Achievement Director will…


Design and Deliver Responsive Curriculum & Assessments in High School Literacy

* Champion the adoption of a nationally-vetted curriculum in our high school English courses. This will include fully internalizing the curricula’s materials and assessments, as well as publishing and packaging them for leaders and teachers. Provide any specific modifications or adjustments to these materials based on our Vision for Humanities instruction.
* Develop and/or finalize a rigorous assessment model that aligns to the grade level expectations for each grade, and prepares students for the assessments needed for graduation: NJGPA/NJSLA, ACT, and where applicable, AP.
* Prepare module overviews and guidance for internalization for each unit of study.
* Monitor the implementation of the curriculum, and make and communicate changes and improvements to content as needed.
* Review and respond to assessment data by making adjustments and modifications to curriculum materials and/or by deploying coaching support to places most in need.


Coach and Support the Implementation of the Academic Program

* Support our high schools to get extraordinary results in both growth and achievement, by engaging in coaching & strategy sessions with each school as aligned to that school’s plan for coaching and development.

By working with instructional leaders in each school, build our school-based leaders’ content knowledge and instructional leadership capacity * - this may include engaging in walk-throughs, student work analysis protocols, coaching O3s, leading and monitoring content meetings, supporting PD implementation, and more.
* Ensure that every one of our schools is creating equitable experiences for students by increasing support at high-needs campuses when needed, and partnering with Heads of Schools in order to drive rapid improvement in key academic systems and processes.
* Analyze data and student work from major assessments with instructional leaders at each school and make recommendations about responding to misconceptions and implementing instructional next steps.
* Serve as a point person for all things programmatic, operational, data-related, and logistical – from assessment questions to materials management – related to the high school literacy curriculum.


Lead and Engage in Professional Development

* As a resident content expert, lead professional development for leaders and teachers in accordance with the T&L team’s annual professional development strategy, including AP Cohort Meetings, One TEAM, One Sound, Leading For Learning, Heartbeat Summit, etc. Note that, depending on the PD strategy, group sizes for professional development sessions may exceed 100 depending on the PD venue.
* Embrace and develop skill in a wide range and methods of professional development and coaching, including real-time feedback, co-teaching and model teaching, observation and debrief, etc.
* Support content TEAM meetings in high school literacy, on an as-needed basis.
* Engage in research and professional development opportunities within and outside of the T&L team, to continuously grow and develop our team’s knowledge based, spread best practices, and improve on our collective coaching and leadership skills.


Serve as an Outstanding TEAMmate on the Teaching & Learning TEAM

* Collaborate with other members of the T&L high school team team, and vertically with other T&L Humanities TEAMmates, to engage in coherent decision-making across the grade band and content area.
* Participate in the EKG Walk-Through process, to objectively score schools on instructional practice and to generate feedback designed to move schools forward.
* Participate in routine meetings with the T&L team, to solve tactical matters, engage in strategic work together, build vertical content knowledge and program, etc.
* Participate in routine and/or schedule ad hoc meetings with Heads of Schools, School Leaders, and APs, to solve tactical matters, engage in strategic work together, and respond to the most pressing needs our schools have.
* In years that EKGs are in place, participate in the EKG Walk-Through process, to objectively score schools on instructional practice and to generate feedback designed to move schools forward.
* Participate in teacher rubric scoring and rating, to help schools norm their scoring and calibrate the rubric scores for all teachers in a building.

  

**Qualifications** **Must-Haves:**


Exceptional high school content knowledge and alignment to our instructional vision * - knows the ins and outs of everything related to high school standards, assessments, and best practices within the discipline.
* Kid- and teacher-focused: makes recommendations and plans based on what is best for kids and teachers; exhibits a front-line obsession.

Leadership experience * - has served as a School Leader, Assistant Principal, or network leader for two years or more. As a coach and leader for other leaders in our organization, the person in this role needs to have walked the walk.
* Strong data analysis skills: can look at an assessment and data set (including sets of student work), diagnose challenges, and immediately recommend clear next steps for instructional leaders and/or teachers.
* Presence and gravitas: can command the attention of a room when delivering feedback, explaining data, or leading professional development.

Responsiveness, service orientation, and ability to invest and inspire others * - the T&L TEAM exists to support and serve our schools, and so a top-down mentality will not work well.

Big picture thinking * - can develop and drive a vision that will serve schools across multiple cities. Does not get bogged down by logistics or uncertainty.

Detail-orientation * - while keeping an eye trained on the big picture, simultaneously does not let important details slip through the cracks.

Excellent communication skills * - can speak and write compellingly about the discipline and all the nitty gritty details stakeholders will need to know in order to achieve results.
* Proactiveness – does not wait for explicit direction but rather asks the appropriate questions and self-directs; takes on additional projects without compromising the integrity of existing ones.

Flexibility * - sees unforeseen obstacles and challenges as an opportunity to design a better solution
* Nice-to-Haves:
* An advanced degree in Literacy, or extensive study in the science of reading / litera**cy development**

**Who We Are**



East Harlem Scholars Academies are community-based Pre-K to 12 public charter schools operated by East Harlem Tutorial Program (EHTP). EHTP began in 1958 as a children's reading group and has since grown into a multi-site after-school program for traditional public school students and a network of public charter schools focused on significantly increasing the college graduation rate in East Harlem. We are on track to serve at least 25% of East Harlem students by 2025, with enrollment for this year at approximately 2200 students in our schools and after school programs. In 2020, 99% of our seniors were accepted to college, and our current scholars in college are on-track to graduate at eight times the national average of their peers.



At EHTP we also aim to serve as an agent of change and thoughtfully contribute to the national fight for racial equity. Through our organization-wide commitment to anti-racism work, we prepare our scholars to effect change, challenge the status quo, and thrive in the world around them. As staff members, we face our own racial identities and conscious and unconscious biases. With this in mind, all of our professional development, curriculum, organizational materials, and processes are designed with a goal of racial justice. Read our racial equity statement **here**.



We ground all of our work in racial equity, **in our core values**, and in our four guiding pursuits: the Revolutionary Pursuit of Love, the Radical Pursuit of Knowledge, the Responsive Pursuit of Healing, and in the Relentless Pursuit of Results. These pursuits inform and are reflected in our current four key strategic priorities: to increase high-impact, high-quality academic curriculum, programming content, staff capacity, and coaching; to embrace and advance our use of technology; to deepen our embodiment of ethical and equitable radical humanity; and to efficiently operationalize teaching, learning, community, and care.



For more information about Scholars Academies, please visit us at www.eastharlemscholars.org.


**About the Opportunity**



As a teacher with Scholars Academies you will be student facing the majority of the day. You will work closely with your grade team and the instructional leadership team to internalize, and in some cases develop curriculum; provide high-quality instruction; track and measure student progress; create a positive classroom and school culture, and to engage in reflection and continuous improvement. You will also be asked to act as a class advisor for our community of students, providing mentor and support during their high school career. As a team we will work together to prepare students with the skills, strength of character, and emotional well-being to excel academically, lead in their communities, and realize their best possible selves.

We’re the experts in signature categories: cashmere, coats, blazers, pants—and we also collaborate with the coolest brands out there because we know that creativity is contagious. We consider leopard a neutral, speak stripes fluently and live for a great gingham.

We also know that we have a responsibility to the planet and to humanity to choose eco-friendly fabrics and to support our factory workers, without compromise.

StaffCo is a Professional Employer Organization, commonly referred to as a PEO, duly organized and registered under the New York Professional Employer Organization law. StaffCo and SUNY have entered into a professional employer agreement under which StaffCo is the employer of Stony Brook Clinical Practice Management Plan employees and responsible for all aspects of employment, including hirings, promotions, disciplines, terminations, the day-to-day direction and supervision of work, as well as labor relations and collective bargaining. StaffCo is fully responsible for providing all payroll and human resources services, including the payment of wages, collecting and reporting payroll taxes and maintaining any and all employee benefits.  SUNY Stony Brook Hospital is responsible for the operation of the hospital and provision of health care and is the co-employer as is necessary to conduct its responsibilities and for related licensure, regulatory or statutory requirements and obligations.

Given StaffCo’s employment responsibilities, it is deemed the “employer” for employment and labor law purposes.  Thus, the employees are private sector employees of StaffCo, not public sector employees of SUNY.  The private sector nature of the StaffCo employees has been approved by NYS Civil Service and upheld in a decision by the US National Labor Relations Board.

The Center for Justice Innovation is a community justice organization that centers safety and racial justice. Since our founding in 1996, the Center has partnered with community members, courts, and the people most impacted to create stronger, healthier, more just communities. Our decades of experience in courts and communities, coupled with our field-leading research and practitioner expertise, help us drive justice nationwide in innovative, powerful, and durable ways. For more information on how and where we work, please visit www.innovatingjustice.org.


The Center is a 900-employee, $100 million nonprofit that accomplishes its vision through three pillars of work: creating and scaling operating programs to test new ideas and solve problems, performing original research to determine what works (and what doesn’t), and providing expert assistance and policy guidance to justice reformers around the world.

**Operating Programs**


The Center’s operating programs, including the award-winning Red Hook Community Justice Center and Midtown Community Justice Center, test new ideas, solve difficult problems, and attempt to achieve systemic change within the justice system. Our projects include community-based violence prevention programs, alternatives to incarceration, reentry initiatives, and court-based initiatives that reduce the use of unnecessary incarceration and promote positive individual and family change. Through this programming, we have produced tangible results like safer streets, reduced incarceration, and improved neighborhood perceptions of justice.

**Research**


The Center's research teams are staffed with social scientists, data analysts, and lawyers who are academically-trained or have lived experience and who conduct research in the U.S. and globally on diverse criminal-legal system and justice issues. Their work includes evaluating programs and policies; conducting exploratory, community-based studies; and providing research translation and strategic planning for system actors. The Center has published studies on topics including court and jail reform, intimate partner violence, restorative justice, gun violence, reentry, sixth amendment rights, and progressive prosecution. The research teams strive to make their work meaningful and actionable to the communities they work with, policymakers, and practitioners.

**Policy & Expert Assistance**


The Center provides hands-on, planning and implementation assistance to a wide range of jurisdictions in areas of reform such as problem-solving courts (e.g., community courts, treatment courts, domestic violence courts), tribal justice, reducing incarceration and the use of fines/fees and reducing crime and violence. Our current expert assistance takes many forms, including help with analyzing data, strategic planning and consultation, policy guidance, and hosting site visits to its operating programs in the New York City area.

**Center Support**


A dedicated support team within the Center ensures the smooth functioning of operations across various domains, including finance, legal, technology, human resources, fundraising, real estate, and communications. Comprising 15% of the organization's staff, these teams provide essential infrastructure support and innovative solutions aligned with the Center's mission and values.
