This task force consists of a multidisciplinary team of law enforcement, social service providers, non-governmental organizations, faith-based partners, educators, community leaders, and human trafficking survivors. Between December 2018 and May 2022, SCATI partners provided approximately 4,773 hours of service to nearly 300 human trafficking victims (271 sex and 25 labor trafficking victims), conducted 127 investigations and 110 prosecutions, trained 5,075 professionals about human trafficking, held 83 outreach events, created 3 professional research reports, and started an enriching Survivor Advisory Board (SAB).

**Salary range:**$63,952.00 – $95,000.00**Job Description**

Agency Description:

Established in 1805, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (the NYC Health Department) is the oldest and largest health department in the country. Our mission is to protect and improve the health of all New Yorkers, in service of a vision of a city in which all New Yorkers can realize their full health potential, regardless of who they are, how old they are, where they are from, or where they live.

As a world-renowned public health agency with a history of building transformative public health programming and infrastructure, innovating in science and scholarship to advance public health knowledge, and responding to urgent public health crises from New York City’s yellow fever outbreak in 1822, to the COVID-19 pandemic we are a hub for public health innovation, expertise, and programs, and services. We serve as the population health strategist, and policy, and planning authority for the City of New York, while also having a vast impact on national and international public policy, including programs and services focused on food and nutrition, anti-tobacco support, chronic disease prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, family and child health, environmental health, mental health, and racial and social justice work, among others.

Our Agency’s five strategic priorities, building off a recently-completed strategic planning process emerging from the COVID-19 emergency, are:  
1) To re-envision how the Health Department prepares for and responds to health emergencies, with a focus on building a “response-ready” organization, with faster decision-making, transparent public communications, and stronger surveillance and bridges to healthcare systems 2) Address and prevent chronic and diet-related disease, including addressing rising rates of childhood obesity and the impact of diabetes, and transforming our food systems to improve nutrition and enhance access to healthy foods  
3) Address the second pandemic of mental illness including: reducing overdose deaths, strengthening our youth mental health systems, and supporting people with serious mental illness  
4) Reduce black maternal mortality and make New York a model city for women’s health  
5) Mobilize against and combat the health impacts of climate change

Our 7,000-plus team members bring extraordinary diversity to the work of public health. True to our value of equity as a foundational element of all of our work, and a critical foundation to achieving population health impact in New York City, the NYC Health Department has been a leader in recognizing and dismantling racism’s impacts on the health of New Yorkers and beyond. In 2021, the NYC Board of Health declared racism as a public health crisis. With commitment to advance anti-racist public health practices that dismantle systems that perpetuate inequitable power, opportunity and access, the NYC Health Department continues to work in and with communities and community organizations to increase their access to health services and decrease avoidable health outcomes.

Michael White, the renowned chef, restaurateur and innovator who helped define Manhattan’s modern Italian restaurant scene with destinations like Marea, Ai Fiori, and Osteria Morini, makes his return to New York with the October opening of Santi, from his BBianco Hospitality Group. Situated in the heart of midtown at Tishman Speyer’s 520 Madison Avenue, Santi will explore seasonal Italian cooking through the lens of White’s many years living in Italy and the South of France, offering both a culinary retrospective and an exciting next step in his storied career.

The name Santi is derived from a fond memory of White’s culinary mentor, Gianluigi Morini, a chef and bon vivant who helmed the kitchen at San Domenico. Eager to taste the dishes from the kitchen, he would wave off a plate and utensils and say: “Le mani degli chef sono come le mani dei santi” – “The hands of chefs are like the hands of saints.” At Santi, White’s menu retells the story of his years living and working in Imola, the Amalfi coast, and the South of France, with a menu consisting of handmade pastas, meats, fish, vegetables, crudos, rotating specials, and large format dishes. It builds on his 36 years in the kitchen and traverses the whole of the Italian peninsula with a focus on seasonality. There will be wild game, truffles, and ragouts in the fall, ephemeral green market produce in the spring, and rare ingredients from across the globe incorporated thoughtfully and with nuance.

The Assistant General Manager is responsible for ensuring the excellence, creativity, and profitability of Santi’s dining experience. The position serves as a leader, educator, coach and mentor to the front of house staff and works under the direction and guidance of the General Manager.

**ABOUT US**

Propelled by the beauty of balance, The Hudson is where natural, timeless beauty meets science-based aesthetic services. We founded our company to demystify cosmetic dermatology and make it more accessible. We believe everyone should look their best based on their own skin goals, so we put together a carefully curated collection of the safest medically-tested procedures that deliver optimal results. We serve our clients with 3 core principles in mind:

CUSTOM SOLUTIONS - We prioritize our clients’ concerns and inspire confidence by designing bespoke solutions for achieving their goals with The Beauty of Balance in mind.

RESULTS, SIMPLIFIED – We believe in a highly curated list of proven treatments and products that get our clients consistent, sustainable results. Skincare and medical spa services are often redundant and overly complicated. Our protocols rely on simplified membership plans to create consistent routines while minimizing financial burdens.

AESTHETIC EXPERTISE - We believe aesthetic treatments should be performed only under the leadership of a physician with expertise and training in aesthetic medicine. At The Hudson, all treatment protocols have been designed by our medical team led by Dr Brad Gandolfi, a double board-certified Plastic Surgeon

The Hudson Med Spa was conceptualized and founded by medical director, Dr. Brad Gandolfi.

Education Through Music is a tax exempted 501(c)(3) organization

**About this Organization:**

Education Through Music was founded as a means to improve student engagement, academic performance, and social development through the use of music as a core- curriculum subject in under-resourced schools. ETM makes high quality in-school music education a reality for over 18,000 underserved students in NYC who would otherwise have limited or no exposure to the arts. Our purpose is to ensure every child has equity and access to a well-rounded education, which includes music.

Since 1991, ETM has worked with schools to create comprehensive, sequential, and sustainable music programs. We do this by partnering with principals to implement a school music program that works with every child. We hire high-quality music teachers to place them with school partners and then we provide 100+ hours of professional development to our teachers and use ongoing evaluation practices for continuous improvement. Finally, we work toward sustaining programs, including supporting teacher credentialing through tuition reimbursement programs for teachers, and collaborating with principals to hire music teachers to school staff so that music programs can continue beyond ETM’s involvement.

ETM partners with under-resourced schools in all five boroughs of New York City, exclusively serving low-income communities. Roughly 75% of our schools are elementary grade, with 20% middle school. Currently, 95% of all ETM students are students of color (including 58% Hispanic and 27% Black), 16% are English Language Learners, 24% have special needs, and 86% are living below the poverty line, leaving ETM to step in and provide in-school music education when the city and state cannot. For the 2023-24 school year, we have 50 school partnerships (32 Bronx, 4 Brooklyn, 4 Manhattan, 9 Queens, and 1 Staten Island), allowing us to work with more than 18,000 children each week, which includes 30+ band, orchestra, and chorus programs.
