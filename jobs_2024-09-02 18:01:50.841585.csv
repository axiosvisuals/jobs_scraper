Job Description
Location:
New York, NY
The fact-checking department is responsible for the accuracy of the editorial content of The New Yorker, a weekly magazine and Web site that covers local, national, and international affairs, culture, literature, and science. New Yorker articles include reported pieces of national significance; profiles of prominent people from around the world; discussions of—and investigations into—important and frequently controversial issues in contemporary society; coverage of significant scientific developments; fiction, humor, and poetry; and criticism and  

coverage of literature and the arts.
The department is well known for its high standards. While the bulk of the department’s work involves reported pieces, its members also fact check fiction, humor pieces, poetry, cartoons, covers, art spreads, audio segments, videos, games, and letters to the editor.  

Checking involves not just verifying the accuracy of each fact, but excellent editorial judgment. Checkers must possess the ability to quickly analyze a writer’s arguments, identify any logical flaws or significant omissions, and draft effective edits. They must be able to look critically at such issues as fairness, balance, and the way the story has been covered elsewhere in the press. To accomplish this, checkers must have a scholar’s eye for detail as well as a generalist’s eye for news and current events.  

The pieces on which the checkers work range from one-line captions to larger fact-heavy pieces of ten-to-fifteen thousand words. The longer pieces often raise significant legal and ethical questions and may well require bringing together sources from all over the world. For this reason, the department puts a premium on candidates with experience in reporting and research, as well as international experience, and language skills.This is a Guild position.
Responsibilities:* Keep continuously abreast of developments in national and international politics, science, and culture.
* Analyze editorial content for accuracy, logical consistency, and editorial integrity.
* Critically examine and evaluate a writer’s sources, decide whether additional documents and/or sources are necessary, and conduct research to identify such resources.
* Read through writers’ documents, interview sources, and accurately distill information relevant to the piece.
* Review supporting content, such as social copy, illustrations, and photographs.
* Work effectively with a team of writers, copy editors, and editors across the publication.
* Additional duties as required, or as assigned by manager.


Skills and Qualifications:* A strong understanding of ethical reporting standards and practices.
* A generalist’s interest in world and national affairs and a scholar’s aptitude for precision.
* An interest in a broad range of cultural subjects.
* Diplomatic skills sufficient to be able to work successfully with a range of people in complex situations.
* Fluency in a second language is preferred but not required.
* Willingness to work some early mornings, nights, weekends, and holidays.


The expected base salary range for this position is from $69,500 - $73,000. Salary offers are based on a wide range of factors including but not limited to relevant skills, training, experience, and education.
