**Consumer Frauds & Protection Bureau - New York City**  

**Student Mediator**  

**Reference No. CPB\\_PUGS\\_FALL\\_2024**  



**Application Deadline is August 30, 2024\\***  

**Paid, Part-Time Placement for Undergraduate Students**


The Consumer Frauds and Protection Bureau is seeking undergraduate students to serve as student mediators for pay in
  

its lower Manhattan office. The Bureau prosecutes businesses and individuals engaged in fraudulent, misleading,
  

deceptive, or illegal trade practices**.**
  

  

In addition to litigating, the Bureau mediates thousands of complaints each year from individual consumers. A large
  

percentage of these complaints are resolved satisfactorily through an informal mediation process. The student is an
  

integral part of this mediation process.
  

  

Students are given the title of ""Mediators"" and act as consumer advocates in negotiating consumer complaints with
  

merchants. Each mediator is assigned a number of complaint files covering a broad range of consumer issues including
  

retail sales, mail order transactions, credit transactions, telemarketing, warranty problems, home repair, and
  

automobiles.
  

  

The student mediator is exposed to the Office's procedures and philosophy and deals directly with consumers and
  

merchants to resolve complaints. Student mediators are taught interviewing techniques and will have the opportunity to
  

develop analytical skills as they learn to focus on the underlying issues to reach a resolution of each complaint. While
  

each complaint is reviewed by a member of our professional staff, the student mediator typically exercises significant
  

discretion and independent judgment. Professional staff and attorneys are always available to answer questions. The
  

position gives students an unusual degree of responsibility and requires them to display excellent judgment.
  

  

**Placement Details**

* **The format of this placement is hybrid.** Students must be available to work in-person at our Lower Manhattan

office at least one (1) day per week. On the days student will be working remotely, they will need to have access

semester. Students who are available to continue working during the spring semester are preferred. *Please be*

Exosomes are nano-sized biovesicles released into surrounding body fluids upon fusion of multivesicular bodies and the plasma membrane. They were shown to carry cell-specific cargos of proteins, lipids, and genetic materials, and can be selectively taken up by neighboring or distant cells far from their release, reprogramming the recipient cells upon their bioactive compounds. Therefore, the regulated formation of exosomes, specific makeup of their cargo, cell-targeting specificity are of immense biological interest considering extremely high potential of exosomes as non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers, as well as therapeutic nanocarriers. We focus on the potential use of exosomes as valuable diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for their cell-lineage and state-specific contents, and possibilities as therapeutic vehicles for drug and gene delivery. Exosomes carry great regenerative properties. We are looking to share and distribute these to the providers that are utilizing current stem cell therapy. Also ones that are using platelet rich plasma, an extremely painful and 7000x less effective treatment.

**Who We Are**



East Harlem Scholars Academies are community-based Pre-K to 12 public charter schools operated by East Harlem Tutorial Program (EHTP). EHTP began in 1958 as a children's reading group and has since grown into a multi-site after-school program for traditional public school students and a network of public charter schools focused on significantly increasing the college graduation rate in East Harlem. We are on track to serve at least 25% of East Harlem students by 2025, with enrollment for this year at approximately 2200 students in our schools and after school programs. In 2020, 99% of our seniors were accepted to college, and our current scholars in college are on-track to graduate at eight times the national average of their peers.



At EHTP we also aim to serve as an agent of change and thoughtfully contribute to the national fight for racial equity. Through our organization-wide commitment to anti-racism work, we prepare our scholars to effect change, challenge the status quo, and thrive in the world around them. As staff members, we face our own racial identities and conscious and unconscious biases. With this in mind, all of our professional development, curriculum, organizational materials, and processes are designed with a goal of racial justice. Read our racial equity statement **here**.



We ground all of our work in racial equity, **in our core values**, and in our four guiding pursuits: the Revolutionary Pursuit of Love, the Radical Pursuit of Knowledge, the Responsive Pursuit of Healing, and in the Relentless Pursuit of Results. These pursuits inform and are reflected in our current four key strategic priorities: to increase high-impact, high-quality academic curriculum, programming content, staff capacity, and coaching; to embrace and advance our use of technology; to deepen our embodiment of ethical and equitable radical humanity; and to efficiently operationalize teaching, learning, community, and care.
