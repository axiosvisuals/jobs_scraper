Jayce Grayye Consulting is seeking an experienced Account Executive for one of our clients. Our client is the leading conversation intelligence software for outside sales, serving industries like HVAC, solar, and window sales. Their mobile app records and analyzes face-to-face sales conversations to help improve sales performance. Their vision is to make the offline world of commerce as searchable as the internet.

They are growing 20% MoM, with hundreds of clients, including Fortune 500 companies, a Net Revenue Retention above 170%, an NPS higher than the iPhone’s, and they are cash flow positive. They are one of the fastest-growing startups globally and historically, backed by Byron Deeter from Bessemer Venture Partners, the top Cloud investor in the world, and recognized as a Cloud 100 Rising Star company.

**Who you are**

* A customer obsessive: You deeply care about delighting customers and solving their pains, not vanity metrics.
* An infinite learner: You're always looking to learn more and faster, feeling uneasy when complacent. Constantly seeking discomfort.
* A team player: You thrive on giving and receiving feedback, learning, and growing as a team.
* Unafraid of failure: You take risks, see failure as an opportunity to learn and grow, and aren’t afraid to try unconventional ideas. The unconventional excites you.
* Extremely focused: You practice extreme focus in everything you do, always prioritizing your time and resources for maximum efficiency.

Their operating principle is to run like a high-speed reinforcement learner: a machine learning algorithm that plays a game millions of times to become invincible in a short amount of time.

**The role**

“Startup equals growth” - Paul Graham.

In their case, growth equals sales.

Since they began selling in 2022, they’ve grown 89% month-over-month, and continue to grow at 30% MoM after surpassing seven figures in Annual Recurring Revenue.

They are growing insanely fast, but still not quickly enough.

They have so much demand for their product that they don’t have the time to close all the leads coming through their pipeline.

Your job will be to help them grow faster.

You will be hopping on customer demos, doing follow-up meetings, closing deals, and evangelizing their gospel of conversation intelligence for the physical world.

**What will I be doing in my day-to-day?**

* Work closely with potential customers from initial contact to deal close.
* Maintain a healthy sales pipeline and keep momentum.
* Conduct sales presentations and demos.
* Provide weekly forecasts.
* Close around 10 mid-market customers a month.
* Work on a few large enterprise deals.
* Evangelize the power of conversation intelligence for the physical world to your network.
* Attend events to connect with potential customers.
* Sales is a product: You will be one of the product managers of the client’s sales engine. It is your responsibility to help optimize their sales product by developing and executing new ideas to enhance the sales funnel.
* Generate your own pipeline by prospecting on LinkedIn, networks, referrals, and existing customers.
* Always keep learning.

**Skills & Requirements**

* 2+ years of quota-carrying sales experience in SaaS.
* Comfortable selling to Sales Directors, C-suite level, and VP-level buyers.
* Demonstrated strong work ethic, resiliency, discipline, and coachability.
* Proven record of consistently hitting quota in previous role(s).
* Exceptional communication skills via text, email, phone, Zoom, and in person.
* Intelligent, competitive, detail-oriented, resourceful, persistent, team player, and eternally optimistic.

**Nice to haves**

* Experience selling other conversation intelligence software like Gong, Chorus, Avoma, or Balto.ai.
* Experience in a competitive, high-feedback environment, e.g., college sports.
* Experience selling SaaS in the home improvement/home service industry, e.g., ServiceTitan.
