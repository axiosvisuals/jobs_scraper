**Salary Range:**$97,012.00 – $97,012.00**Job Description**

Established in 1805, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (the NYC Health Department) is the oldest and largest health department in the country. Our mission is to protect and improve the health of all New Yorkers, in service of a vision of a city in which all New Yorkers can realize their full health potential, regardless of who they are, how old they are, where they are from, or where they live.

As a world-renowned public health agency with a history of building transformative public health programming and infrastructure, innovating in science and scholarship to advance public health knowledge, and responding to urgent public health crises from New York City’s yellow fever outbreak in 1822, to the COVID-19 pandemic we are a hub for public health innovation, expertise, and programs, and services. We serve as the population health strategist, and policy, and planning authority for the City of New York, while also having a vast impact on national and international public policy, including programs and services focused on food and nutrition, anti-tobacco support, chronic disease prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, family and child health, environmental health, mental health, and racial and social justice work, among others.

Our Agency’s five strategic priorities, building off a recently-completed strategic planning process emerging from the COVID-19 emergency, are:  
1) To re-envision how the Health Department prepares for and responds to health emergencies, with a focus on building a “response-ready” organization, with faster decision-making, transparent public communications, and stronger surveillance and bridges to healthcare systems 2) Address and prevent chronic and diet-related disease, including addressing rising rates of childhood obesity and the impact of diabetes, and transforming our food systems to improve nutrition and enhance access to healthy foods  
3) Address the second pandemic of mental illness including: reducing overdose deaths, strengthening our youth mental health systems, and supporting people with serious mental illness  
4) Reduce black maternal mortality and make New York a model city for women’s health  
5) Mobilize against and combat the health impacts of climate change

Our 7,000-plus team members bring extraordinary diversity to the work of public health. True to our value of equity as a foundational element of all of our work, and a critical foundation to achieving population health impact in New York City, the NYC Health Department has been a leader in recognizing and dismantling racism’s impacts on the health of New Yorkers and beyond. In 2021, the NYC Board of Health declared racism as a public health crisis. With commitment to advance anti-racist public health practices that dismantle systems that perpetuate inequitable power, opportunity and access, the NYC Health Department continues to work in and with communities and community organizations to increase their access to health services and decrease avoidable health outcomes.

In essence, your role involves:


* Breaking new ground as the first local designer, leveraging expansive creative freedom to explore and produce unique, impactful work.
* Collaborating with regional marketing manager and copywriter to develop and implement innovative design solutions that align with ACT's brand and vision.
* Creating design assets that resonate with both North American and Latin American markets, ensuring cultural relevance and market-specific appeal.
* Creating visually compelling graphics and layouts for digital and print media, including websites, social media, presentations, brochures, pitch decks, case studies, and other B2B marketing materials.
* Conducting user research and usability testing to ensure designs meet user needs and improve overall user experience.
* Managing multiple design projects simultaneously, ensuring timely delivery and adherence to project deadlines.
* Keeping up-to-date with the latest design trends, tools, and technologies to continuously improve design quality and efficiency.
* Participating in brainstorming sessions and contributing creative ideas to support marketing campaigns and initiatives.

  


**Your Expertise:**



To be successful in this role, we are looking for candidates with the following qualifications and attributes:


* 5-7 years of working experience as a designer with core skills in design systems and visual identity and familiarity with presentation and experience design
* Fluent in Adobe InDesign, Illustrator and Photoshop and able to use PowerPoint effectively.
* You are assertive and work well independently as you will be the first and for now only designer responsible for design in the Americas region, translating our global brand into the local market and building the design discipline in our US office. You understand how to develop the brand to influence your audience and build a consistent value with customers over time.
* You are a creative hands-on thinker that likes operating in the landscape of a commercial business rather than a creative agency. You know how to match creative ideas with the needs of the business. You know what to offer our customers on a visual level in order to convey thoughts and concepts behind the design proposition.
* You are able to present your designs confidently and are not afraid to explain your ideas and receive feedback.
* You know how to find the right balance between quality and time, and have an excellent eye for detail to ensure that the work delivered is always of the highest quality.
* Our global team already includes UX/UI and motion graphic designers, so this role will not focus on those areas. Instead, we're seeking skills in different design specialties to complement the US-based team's primary objectives.

Job:
Adjunct Lecturer: CLCV UN3027 Digital Classics - History and Methods
Job Summary:
The Department of Classics and Ancient Studies at Barnard College seeks a part-time instructor to teach CLCV UN3027 Digital Classics - History and Methods during the fall semester of 2024.
Job Description:
The exact instructional assignments and other academic responsibilities are determined by the Chair or Director.
From the course catalog:
In this course, we will look critically at the broadly-defined field of Digital Classics—the meeting point of Digital Humanities (DH) and the study of cultures of the ancient Mediterranean—from its origins in the late 1940s through to the present day. In addition to becoming familiar with a range of Digital Classics projects and gaining hands-on experience with some of the core tools that make Digital Classics possible in the present day, we will read theoretical scholarship in both Digital Classics and DH more generally, to think about not just what has been and can be done, but also what should (and should not) be done. We also will think about where (and whether!) to define the boundaries of “Classics” and the boundaries of “digital.”

Job:
Adjunct: AFRS 3160 Fanon’s Psychology of the Oppressed
Job Summary:
The Africana Studies Department at Barnard College seeks a part-time instructor to teach AFRS 3160, Fanon’s Psychology of the Oppressed during the fall semester.
Job Description:
Frantz Fanon’s ideas have been influential for decades among theorists, practitioners, and activists alike. This seminar is focused on understanding Fanon’s particular perspective on the psychology of the oppressed and its relevance for examining the experience of past and present racialized inequality and its effects in society. The course is divided into four sections, which build cumulatively.
I). An introductory section introduces Fanon’s central ideas (e.g., dialecticism, existentialism, post-colonialism) in their intellectual and socio-historical context (e.g., the Algerian revolution, African decolonization, South African Apartheid, the US civil rights and women’s rights movements).
II). A second section locates Fanon in psychological theory and therapeutic theory and practice. The cultural and political (Eurocentric?) roots of psychological theory and practice are examined as are notions of oppression causing psychological and physical violence as well as psychopathology / psychological disorder.
III). A third section examines Fanon and others psychological approaches to identity with particular attention to the presumed “inferiority complex” of oppressed peoples, nationalist and other reconstructions of identity in opposition to oppression, sociological psychological conceptualizations of stigma, and Dubois’s influential ideas regarding double consciousness.
IV). A fourth and final section focuses on resistance and rebellion. The focus here is on the psycho-moral implications of (violent, peaceful, non-disruptive) action against oppression with reference to the distinct perspectives of Fanon in comparison to influential figures like Gandhi and M.L.K Jr. These issues are linked to a post-Fanon approach to the psychology of the oppressed called Liberation Psychology.
The exact instructional assignments and other academic responsibilities are determined by the Chair or Director.

TED is a non-profit that believes Ideas change everything. Powerful ideas, powerfully presented, move us: to feel something, to think differently, to take action.


At TED, we seek to bridge, include, and diversify because we truly believe ideas are for everyone. It is important to us to attract individuals from diverse backgrounds who are curious about the world.

**ABOUT THE AUDACIOUS PROJECT**


The Audacious Project is a philanthropic platform dedicated to supporting big, bold solutions to the world’s most urgent challenges. We curate world-changing ideas across a wide range of issue areas by helping non-profit organizations to develop compelling 5+ year plans, then partner with our community of leading philanthropists and institutions to unlock large-scale collaborative funding. These catalytic philanthropic grants are coupled with ongoing support from the Audacious Project team, in order to ensure these ideas can continue to be both audacious and achievable.


Housed at TED, The Audacious Project launched publicly in 2018 and has since catalyzed over $5B for over 60 projects, in issue areas ranging from climate to breakthrough science to global health. We are honored to have a vibrant donor community of nearly 50 philanthropists and institutions that come together annually to invest in cohorts of 8-10 visionary projects.

* Manage external agencies, copywriters, and content creators as needed
* Help the Executive Director and team leaders stay in front of trends and be responsible for updating the Audacious brand over time, including changes to key touchpoints
* Serve as a liaison to TED brand counterparts and find opportunities for collaboration and mutual support

 **Qualifications** **YOU ARE...** A thoughtful brand leader with experience building consensus and excitement across a wide variety of stakeholders and cross-functional partners. You are curious, creative, and know the power of content and storytelling to engage people and drive them toward action.

*For more information about our benefits, see below!*


We are proud to be a member of the Rentokil family of companies, the global leader in Pest Control and other services across more than 90 countries. We pride ourselves on being a trusted partner to many of the world's leading brands and serve consumer and business customers across multiple industries. We are extremely proud of our legacy of excellence and constantly work to fulfill our mission to ""protect people, enhance lives, and preserve the planet.""

**Three-piece suits. Cold calls in a cubicle. Lone wolves.**
------------------------------------------------------------

**Nope. Not here.**
-------------------

  

At Terminix Nation, we view sales as the natural result of building strong relationships and solving customers’ problems. If you’re nodding your head right now, we’d love to meet you.


Our sales team is the engine that keeps Terminix running. And we reward the team accordingly with a competitive salary and benefits — including medical, dental, vision, a 401(k) with company match, and more. There are also opportunities to get trained, gain new skills, and build an awesome career.


But first things first. When you start in sales at Terminix Nation, you’ll get down and dirty. You’ll learn how to inspect and identify infestations (or conditions conducive to infestations) of all kinds of organisms, insects, birds, or other pests. Sounds awesome, right? You’ll learn all about what we do and how you can make your clients’ homes safer and their lives better. Once you know that, you’ll turn your talents to proposals and presentations that result in sales.

**As a Residential Sales Professional, here’s what you can expect**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

* You won’t be tied to a desk. You’ll be out and about — mobile, independent, and growing your career on your own terms. You’ll be the face of Terminix to your local community (with the backing of a national brand), and your clients will count on you to protect their homes and their families.
* When you first join Terminix Nation, you’ll spend a few months in training. Once you’ve got that and some state required licenses and certificates under your belt, you’ll take the lead with your own customers.
* You’ll get rewarded with competitive pay and robust benefits to cover you and your family. As a teammate, you will be eligible for a 401(k) with company match, company-paid life insurance, tuition reimbursement, and a generous student loan repayment program. You put in the work, and you’ll reap the rewards.
* You’ll be part of a community – bonus points if you’re already a leader in yours. Our bonds are strong at Terminix Nation and the relationships we develop in the communities we serve are unparalleled. Our teammates give back through volunteering, donations, scholarships, and more.
* You’ll be onboarded and trained by the best of ’em. You’ll get paid to get licensed, something you’ll have for a lifetime. You’ll know how to bust bugs at home, too.

**What your days will look like**
---------------------------------

* Hit the books with training modules and hit the streets with on-the-job training with your teammates. You’ll learn product knowledge and sales techniques for selling the full suite of Terminix products. We’ll train and support you through state licensing and other company requirements.
* You’ll inspect and assess pest problems with precision and suggest Terminix solutions following company policy and pricing instructions.
* You must be obsessed with the customer’s experience — delivering exceptional service, following up to ensure satisfaction, and thinking creatively about how to grow the relationship. And if an account is delinquent, you’ll need to handle that with grace and effectiveness, too.
* Of course, you’ve got to like to sell solutions to problems. You will be expected to meet and greet potential customers to generate new business for the branch.
* There’s an opportunity to grow into a role you’re passionate about and fits your skillset — whether that’s management or another opportunity at Terminix.

**Some non-negotiables**
------------------------


There are some things you’ll just need to have or know to join Terminix Nation as a Residential Sales Professional.

* A high school education or GED.
* A valid driver’s license from your current state of residence.
* Strong social, customer service, and communication skills — in fact, we’d be really impressed if you came to this role with related experience and/or training in sales.
* Some basic math skills — add, subtract, multiply, and divide in all units of measure, using whole numbers, common fractions, and decimals. You’ll need to be able to follow instructions for mixing on product labels.

**Straight talk about the physical demands of our work**
--------------------------------------------------------


We’re not going to sugarcoat it. The essential functions of this job have some physical demands (of course, reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the essential functions.) Here’s what we mean:

* You’ve got to be able to move up to 10 lbs. regularly and 11–20 lbs. frequently, whether that’s lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, or otherwise repositioning objects.
* You’ll move around a lot — regularly sitting, climbing, balancing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, and crawling. You’ll go up and down stairs, ladders, scaffolding, ramps, and poles. And you’ll need to keep your balance when walking, standing, or crouching on narrow, slippery, or moving surfaces. (You’ll definitely get your steps in.)
* You must be able to safely operate a motor vehicle and make sure it and all other equipment is kept clean.
* The vision to perform detail-oriented activities at distances close to the eyes or within arm’s reach.
* Sometimes you’ll need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE), like an OSHA-compliant respirator, and you’ll need to be okay with regularly working in confined spaces, narrow aisles, or passageways (you know, where critters live).
