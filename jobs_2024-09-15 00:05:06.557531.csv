Please answer the attached question to be considered.

**Supporting women who are D cup+ and inspiring them to feel amazing!**

**About Bravissimo**

Hello! We are Bravissimo, the British brand that offers lingerie and swimwear to women who wear a D cup bra and above. We are dedicated to supporting and celebrating our customers and want to inspire big boobed women to feel amazing.

We started in the UK back in 1995 when two friends were frustrated by not being able to find a good choice of bras in their size. Convinced they couldn’t be the only two who needed bigger sizes, they set out with a vision to provide a great choice of bras in bigger cup sizes and create an environment where big boobed women could celebrate their figures and feel good about themselves.

Today we have 26 stores in the UK, a well-established ecommerce operation, and thousands of loyal customers we support every day. We launched our US website in 2017 and had loads of requests from US customers to open a store in the States. We’re very excited to have now opened our first US Bravissimo store in New York City! We have grown a lot since we started in 1995, but our purpose remains the same: to inspire more big boobed women to feel amazing.

**About the Role**

Working as a retail sales associate at Bravissimo is a job like no other! Every day, you will inspire women to feel amazing, creating a fantastic experience for our customers from the moment they walk into the store.

Your role will be extremely varied and you will be part of a team that is dedicated to giving our customers an exceptional and personal service. You will be involved in providing our ‘feel good’ fitting experience to customers, giving them real insight into their size and styles that fit and flatter them. You will also manage stock, both on the store floor and behind the scenes, as well as operating the till. Your main goal will be to make sure every customer leaves the store feeling better about themselves than when they came in.

You will need to be flexible regarding working hours and ideally available to work weekdays and weekends.

**About You**

If you are passionate, enthusiastic and genuinely love helping and going the extra mile for others, this position could be perfect for you. Previous experience in retail, or in the lingerie industry is not needed as we will give you all the training you need. What is more important is having a real passion for customer service and an eagerness to learn.

If you think this could be the job for you, please send us your resume along with a letter which should explain why you would like to work for Bravissimo and what excites you about the role.

**About KPot**

K-Pot offers both worlds of Korean BBQ and Asian Hot Pot.

What is Hot Pot? Hot pot is an Asian cooking method, prepared with a

simmering pot of soup stock at the dining table, containing a variety of

East Asian foods and ingredients. While your hot pot is simmering,

ingredients are placed into the pot and are cooked at the table in front

of your eyes, in a manner similar to fondue.

Korean barbecue known locally as (고기구이) gogi-gui, “Meat Roast”,

refers to the Korean cuisine method of grilling meat such as beef,

chicken or pork, that you prepare yourself at your table. Our menu

offers an extensive selection of fresh quality meats, seafood, noodles,

and vegetables for Hot Pot and BBQ experience.
