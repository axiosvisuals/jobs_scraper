**Description:**  

  

**Position Summary:** The Adams-Banks administration has outlined a bold vision to reimagine the educational experience for all New York City Public School (NYCPS) students so they graduate with real-world skills and experience, a head start on postsecondary, and a strong plan to put them on a path to a rewarding career and long-term economic security. Within the context of this vision, the Office of Student Pathways (Pathways), under the Chief of Student Pathways focuses on the alignment of school curriculum, instruction, and operations to ensure that all students graduate with real-world skills and experience, a head start on life after high school, and a strong plan to put them on a path to a rewarding career and long-term economic security.
