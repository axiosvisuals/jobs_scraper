Change lives. Have fun.**  

A little quiz: What do Batman and Robin, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Hermoine Granger and Harry Potter, and Venus and Serena Williams have in common?  

Answer: Each member of the pair makes the other stronger.  

That’s how it is with an Orangetheory Studio Manager and Assistant Studio Manager (ASM). They’re a doublet, a duo, a dyad. And while the manager is ultimately in charge, without that able-bodied sidekick, the studio wouldn’t run nearly as smoothly.  

So if you’d like to be half of such a pair, to know the ropes as well as you know your members’ names, to step in when your manager steps out, to balance each other’s strengths, to set goals and surpass them...then Orangetheory just might be looking for you.  

Every day will be different but, you’ll be representing the Orangetheory brand as you share the science of this workout you want everyone to love as much as you do.  

Maybe you’ll use this post as a stepping stone in your management career or maybe this is where you want to be forever. But if you’ve been at even one Orangetheory class, you feel the warmth, the enthusiasm, the genuine sense of being where you need to be — feelings you’ll be hard-pressed to find anywhere but here.  

  

Specific job duties and selection requirements vary between Orangetheory studio locations and more details can be provided by the studio’s hiring manager if you are selected to move forward in the interview process.

For more information about our benefits, see below!

We are proud to be a member of the Rentokil family of companies, the global leader in Pest Control and other services across more than 90 countries. We pride ourselves on being a trusted partner to many of the world's leading brands and serve consumer and business customers across multiple industries. We are extremely proud of our legacy of excellence and constantly work to fulfill our mission to ""protect people, enhance lives, and preserve the planet.""

**Creepy crawlies and contented customers. Intrigued?** **You might be just who we're looking for.**  
Busting bugs has its benefits. Company-provided truck, gas, and phone. Benefits including a 401(k) with a company match. Amazing earning potential. But it’s more than that. It’s serving with a smile. It’s having your teammates’ backs. It’s going above and beyond and making a difference. We step in and step up when people have problems they can’t fix, and they need the pros. We crush their pest problems and lift their spirits.

Back to you. Are you a hard worker? Can you follow direction, adapt to change, and solve problems? Are you organized, friendly, and motivated to succeed? That’s a great place to start.

**As a Pest Control Technician, here’s what you can expect** 

* You won’t be tied to a desk. You’ll be out and about — mobile, independent, and growing your career with a clear view of next steps. You’ll be the face of Terminix to your local community (with the backing of a national brand), and your clients will count on you to protect their businesses, their homes, and their families.
* When you first join Terminix Nation, you’ll spend a few months in training. Once you’ve got that and some state required licenses and certificates under your belt, you’ll take the lead with your own customers.
* You’ll get rewarded with competitive pay and robust benefits to cover you and your family. As a teammate, you will be eligible for a 401(k) with company match, company-paid life insurance, tuition reimbursement, and a generous student loan repayment program. You put in the work, and you’ll reap the rewards.
* You’ll be part of a community — bonus points if you’re already a leader in yours. Our bonds are strong at Terminix Nation and the relationships we develop in the communities we serve are unparalleled. Our teammates give back through volunteering, donations, scholarships, and more.
* You’ll be onboarded and trained by the best of ‘em. You’ll get paid to get licensed, something you’ll have for a lifetime. You’ll know how to bust bugs at home, too.

**What your days will look like**

* Roll up your sleeves and get ready to learn how we take care of customers. You’ll become an expert in applying our company products so they’re safe and effective.
* Are you a good driver? As a technician, your office is the cab of your Terminix truck. You’ll use it on calls and take it home, too. Same goes for your Terminix phone. We trust our technicians.
* You’ll be responsible for building relationships with customers, scheduling and confirming their appointments, helping with sales to current customers, and expanding our product to new customers.
* Does technology scare you? That’s okay. We provide training and support to ensure you’re comfortable using state-of-the-art tools. You’ll also need to have strong communication skills so that you can email, text, call, talk, and write effectively. Oh, and sometimes there’s paperwork.
* There’s an opportunity to grow into a role you’re passionate about and fits your skillset — whether that’s management, a move to sales, or another opportunity at Terminix.

**Some non-negotiables**  
There are some things you’ll just need to have or know to join Terminix Nation as a Pest Control Technician.

* High school diploma or GED; or one to three months related experience and/or training; or equivalent combination of education and experience.
* Solid reading, writing, and verbal communication skills and the ability to present information in both internal and external settings.
* Some basic math skills — add, subtract, multiply, and divide in all units of measure, using whole numbers, common fractions, and decimals. You’ll need to be able to follow instructions for mixing on product labels.
* With the help of Terminix (and with the company footing the bill), you’ll need to maintain the licenses/certificates as required by federal, state, and/or local regulations. And you’ll need a valid driver’s license.

**Straight talk about the physical demands of our work**  
We’re not going to sugarcoat it. The essential functions of this job have some physical demands (of course, reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the essential functions.) Here’s what we mean:

* You’ve got to be able to move up to 10 lbs. regularly and 11–20 lbs. frequently, whether that’s lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, or otherwise repositioning objects.
* You’ll move around a lot — regularly sitting, climbing, balancing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, and crawling. You’ll go up and down stairs, ladders, scaffolding, ramps, and poles. And you’ll need to keep your balance when walking, standing, or crouching on narrow, slippery, or moving surfaces. (You’ll definitely get your steps in.)
* You must be able to safely operate a motor vehicle and make sure it and all other equipment is kept clean.
* The vision to perform detail-oriented activities at distances close to the eyes or within arm’s reach.
* Sometimes you’ll need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE), like an OSHA-compliant respirator, and you’ll need to be okay with regularly working in confined spaces, narrow aisles, or passageways (you know, where critters live).

**Work conditions**  
Pests don’t always live in nice places — and that’s where we do our work. But don’t worry – we’ll prepare you with all you need to do the work as safely and as comfortably as possible.

* You’ll need to be able to work both inside and outside in your local climate in company-provided weather gear.
* You’ll sometimes be working around mechanical parts, vehicles, electrical current, heights and scaffolding, fumes, dust, and chemicals, and we’ll train you how to handle all of these conditions safely.
* This is kind of a no-brainer — you’ll be around animals and insects.
* And you’ll have to be okay with working in tight, confined spaces, narrow aisles, or passageways — like you might find in crawl spaces. We work where the critters live.

To join Terminix Nation, you’ll need to meet state and federal regulations and company safety requirements.

This position offers a base pay plus commission.

The New York City Public Schools (NYCPS) Office of Community Schools (OCS) supports all schools as places where children have opportunities to learn, gain skills, create joy, and have the experiences that allow children to ignite curiosity and discover their passions and talents. OCS is committed to bringing equity and using a “whole child, whole community” approach – looking holistically at students, families, and communities to ascertain their most pressing needs and decide together which services will best address those needs. The Students in Temporary Housing (STH) team within OCS seeks to increase the capacity of schools and community partners providing tailored social services, healthcare, expanded learning opportunities, and similar support for students and families affected by homelessness.  



The Shelter Based Community Coordinator (SBCC) works under the supervision of the STH Regional Manager, within the Office of Community Schools (OCS) and in the School Culture, Climate and Well-Being team.The SBCC will be placed in shelters across the city based on need. The SBCC’s shelter location is subject to change based on needs. The STH Regional Managers are responsible for supporting a cohort of NYCPS personnel in both shelters and schools. Specifically, SBCCs will greet families as they enter shelter, conduct an initial needs assessment, identify and facilitate tailored support for students and families, and support students and families to access those supports. SBCC’s will act as the escalation point for all support in the shelter(s) they are assigned to, building resources and capacity with the shelter to advance the educational needs of these students.  



SBCCs will serve alongside team members inside the shelters and within the schools, such as Client Care Coordinators, Shelter Case Managers, Shelter Directors, social work and guidance staff, attendance team members, health and mental health providers, teachers, school safety officers, and other personnel.
