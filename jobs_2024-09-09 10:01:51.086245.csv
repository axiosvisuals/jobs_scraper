It is believed that Tito was born in the small beach village of Todos Santos, on Mexico’s Baja peninsula - or maybe it was just outside of Haleiwa, on the North Shore of Oahu. Then again, it might have been the town of Balboa, on the Pacific coast of Panama. Truth is, no one’s quite sure where he’s from! Whenever he’s asked, Tito simply leansback, scratches his chin & replies (in his own language that we call “Tito-Speak”), “I come from da beach, brah. No matter where I am, I’m always at da beach!” Spoken like a true hedonist. It’s that love for the hedonistic beach lifestyle & good times that’s at the heart & soul of Tito’s Burritos & Wings. At Tito’s Burritos & Wings, our slogan is, “It’s all good,” & that motto applies to the whole philosophy we built our business on. In other words, we are 100% committed to giving our customers nothing but goodness; the tastiest food, prepared & served in a casual & easy-going manner, always at a good value. We use only the freshest ingredients in everything we prepare, every order is custom-made the way that YOU want it. It might take a few minutes longer, but we’ll make sure it’s worth the wait. If you’re eating here, kick back & enjoy the music or watch our “wish I was there” TitoVision TV, always tuned to “da beach.” It is our wish that you enjoy everything that Tito’s Burritos & Wings has to offer, & that you leave with an “It’s all good!” feeling. PS: You might see Tito around the shop every once in a while, but sightings are indeed rare. After all, you can’t be a true hedonist & a workaholic at the same time!","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Tito's-Burritos-&-Wings","","","","","","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/3993e2b23f72186e7950b3a3bdb6354f","","",""
