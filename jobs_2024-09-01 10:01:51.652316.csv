Liberal Studies at New York University invites applications for a **Postdoctoral Faculty Fellow** position



to begin September 1, 2025, pending administrative and budgetary approval.



The Liberal Studies Core is a dynamic liberal arts curriculum that provides a global and interdisciplinary



foundation for nearly 100 NYU majors. The curriculum emphasizes conceptual and spatial frameworks to



trace the movement of ideas and the interconnectivity of material culture, through the study of different



texts, histories, exchanges, structures and systems, languages, arts, and writing from early antiquity



through contemporary times. Small seminar-style classes and close faculty-student interaction ensure the



benefits of a liberal arts college within a large urban research university. We are especially interested in



hiring qualified candidates who can contribute through their research, teaching and service to the diversity



and excellence of the Liberal Studies community.



Liberal Studies Postdoctoral Faculty Fellows teach two courses each semester in the Core Curriculum.



Fellows work closely with an assigned Faculty Mentor, they attend pedagogy workshops that explore



innovative approaches to interdisciplinary global teaching, and they have the opportunity to lead faculty



development workshops or host program wide events in their area of scholarly, creative, or pedagogical



expertise. Fellows are appointed for two years, renewable for a third year based on performance and



programmatic need; they are non-tenure track and non-renewable beyond the third year.

Candidates with specialization in TESOL/ESOL/ESL and/or environmental writing are strongly

Salary is $60,000 p.a. plus University benefits. Fellows will be provided with offices, computers, and



professional development funds.

  



Liberal Studies sees diversity, equity and inclusion and belonging as essential to education and the



development of leadership in a globally interconnected world. These values inform LS as a collegial and



respectful environment for students, faculty and staff—with particular attention to improving the student



experience. Liberal Studies strongly encourages applications from women, racial and ethnic minorities,



and other individuals who are under-represented in the profession, across color, creed, race, ethnic and

**A Day in the Life of a Caregiver**

In the simplest terms, a caregiver is a person who provides care for another. When it comes to our team, caregivers play a vital role. Our caregivers are the driving force for positively improving the lives of seniors in our community. They make a direct impact in providing care to seniors who wish to age in the safety and comfort of their home instead of an assisted living facility, an independent living facility, a senior living community, or a nursing home.


Every client will have different needs that they require assistance with, but we make sure to match our clients and caregivers for the optimal fit. Care provided could include assisting with fun hobbies and games that a client enjoys.

Breguet, at the crossroads of culture and innovation All the splendour of truly exceptional horology Symbolizing a proud historical and cultural heritage, as well as avant-garde technology, Breguet has consistently stimulated genuine fascination through its capacity for innovation. From the tourbillon to the gong-spring, many of the inventions by Abraham-Louis Breguet (1747-1823) have left their mark on watchmaking history since 1775. As the enduring benchmark for watchmaking in the great European courts, Breguet has made its way through the ages among illustrious figures such as Marie-Antoinette, Napoleon Bonaparte, Tsar Alexander 1st and Winston Churchill, to mention a few. Acquired by the Swatch Group in 1999, the House of Breguet continues to strengthen its position as an essential stakeholder in today’s watch industry. Its considerable investments in research and development regularly generate new and original innovations representing the very heart of tomorrow’s haute horlogerie. In the wake of this remarkable heritage and knowledge, Breguet unveils new exceptional timepieces each year, with Grandes Complications standing alongside sublime finishes, such as in the case of the Classique Tourbillon Extra-Plat Squelette 5395 model. For this exceptionally thin piece, the house has opted for an extra-thin three-millimeter thick skeleton design for its tourbillon movement. An undertaking that is as much technical as it is artistic with emphasis on craftsmanship.
