We are a medical testing facility that specializes in comprehensive cardiovascular and pulmonary medical evaluations for first responders throughout New Jersey. Our practice was built out of the Captain Buscio Program, a foundation created by Donna Buscio after her husband, Captain Dominick Buscio of the Jersey City Fire Department, unexpectedly passed away at 39 from a heart attack.

Our cardiovascular and pulmonary tests help current and retired members of the police force, state troopers, firefighters, and EMTs to be aware of their cardiovascular health and help to identify any health concerns. Employers do not mandate our tests, and the results do not affect our patients' employment. Currently, we have six different locations across New Jersey and have hopes to open more soon.

**What we do**

We administer tests to evaluate heart and lung functionality. We offer seven different tests for our patients over a five-hour appointment time slot. Our patients are able to come back two weeks after their appointment to review their results with our team of board-certified medical professionals.

The community of scholars will be drawn from the full range of intellectual approaches represented at the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics.

Scholars may have the opportunity to perform a modest amount of teaching in our multidisciplinary courses, according to a plan that they may develop in conjunction with their mentor(s). While teaching, a Scholar may hold a secondary appointment as a Lecturer in an appropriate department, pending sufficient course enrollments and the approval of the Dean of the Faculty.

The Family Treatment/ Rehabilitation Program (FTR) located in Manhattan, Brooklyn and The Bronx offers intensive preventive case management services to families at risk of removal of children to foster care due to neglect and abuse.

Using Solution Based Casework, we actively work with parents to help them develop a more active, consistent and productive role in their child’s educational and social development; we encourage families to build connections to positive supports in their community who will help them sustain their progress.

**DEPARTMENT:** Enhanced Family Foster Care (EFFC)
  
  

**SCHEDULE:** Full Time / Hybrid
  
  

$1,000 HIRING INCENTIVE
  
  

**AGENCY BACKGROUND:**  

MercyFirst is a not-for-profit human and social service agency that has been serving children and families in need since we were founded by the Sisters of Mercy/Hermanas de las Misericordia in 1894. Today our agency continues to address the emotional and physical needs of children and families in Brooklyn, Queens and across Long Island through innovative treatments and life-changing interventions. We provide community-based prevention and family foster care services, group homes in the community for struggling children and families within the child welfare and juvenile justice systems, and short-term residential services for unaccompanied migrant children. Each year, MercyFirst serves more than 3,000 children, teenagers and families overcome enormous obstacles, re-imagine their futures, and develop their full potential.
  
  

**PROGRAM BACKGROUND:**  

Enhanced Family Foster Care (EFFC) combines and replaces the previous separately contracted Family Foster Care (FFC) and Treatment Family Foster Care (TFFC) programs. EFFC recognizes that all children in care have experienced some level of trauma, that their needs may change over time, and that their strengths must be supported so they can reach their full potential. As a blended model, EFFC:
  
  

* Responds to the needs of the child and family - Allows children, parents, and families to receive therapeutic services and support, accessing a full menu of options with less separation into different programs. Families in EFFC placements receive enhanced case management as well as a full array of services, treatment, and supports to help them thrive.
* Increases placement stability for the child: By allowing for the flexibility to increase and decrease services and supports based on the child's behavioral and treatment needs. EFFC supports the formation of a trusting and secure attachment relationship between the child and foster parent. Placement stability provides the opportunity for the foster parent and birth parent/family to build relationships with a shared goal of meeting the child's needs.

*Our firm, with its 35 years of experience managing money and tax strategies for clients, is comprised of a senior investment professional, a seasoned investment/tax professional, and two junior advisors. Our CEO has a unique bio that talks of taking out his first investment at the age of 14. We have developed a sophisticated allocation model that uses multiple, non-correlated asset classes that have academically and historically mitigated risk and volatility, while exposing our clients to options they can’t always access. We seek out and align our company with the industry’s experts and specialists, to create a team around our clients to help realize their financial objectives and dreams. We bring those “Best in Class” industry heavyweights to them!*

*The underlying premise in the office is attributed to Confucius, “Choose a job you love, and you will never work a day in your life.” We created an interesting and pleasurable atmosphere, whereby we do not consider our jobs in the office as work; rather, our passion. It is believed that this culture has certainly attracted a cast of characters (our clients) that we enjoy helping achieve their financial goals and we like to have fun doing it. Many of those clients have been with us for years as we have formed inseparable relationships, leading to a rather admirable retention rate. Though we do work diligently and are always juggling many spinning plates, we balance that with an atmosphere of joviality and flexibility.*

**Job Description**

Our approach stated above has created a more complex service model with many more moving parts than a typical financial planning operation. Because of this, we need an incredibly organized, enthusiastic, forward thinking, go-getter to “drive the traffic” of its fast-paced environment. This culminates in commandeering the day-to-day operations of our firm.

This person must be willing to grasp our concepts and can connect the dots, versus working through a task mechanically. We are looking for someone who is passionate about client service, excited about working with our multiple investment platforms, and has a keen ability to close the many circles and loose ends that come from any service business. That traffic is comprised of fielding in-coming client calls and requests, handling (distributing to others where appropriate), to bring to completion the task that often includes all the various regulatory documentation. This often has multiple steps, and you must possess intense organization.

This person manages and coordinates all day-to-day operations for the CEO of the company to help manage client accounts. You are the glue that holds the team together by ensuring all accounts are ultimately managed flawlessly and buttoned up, and importantly “completing the circle” of the task. You will be responsible for building relationships with the clients and product sponsors. You will have the latitude to make changes as you see fit to make the referenced processes more efficient. Ultimately, over time the qualified person should be mature enough to manage the operations on their own, allowing the investment professionals to be out of the office and in front of clients and/or potential clients.

**Responsibilities include, but are not limited to:**

-Support the team with administrative tasks to help run the accounts smoothly (e.g., phone call triage, paperwork filing, paperwork preparation, account reviews.

-Meeting support - coordinating client and internal schedules, scheduling meetings, recaps, meeting material compilation, post-meeting follow up.

-Put together weekly recap reports and share with the team to ensure everyone is up to speed with the latest issues, concerns, or visions.

-Assist the team across integrated projects to ensure all work is executed timely and accurately.

-Help create and maintain files and database system.

-Oversees all on-going projects; including working closely with the CEO to allow him to be unearthed from the voluminous amount of service requests.

-Build relationships with clientele alleviating their requests before passing them along.

**Daily Basics:**

- Prepare and process new account forms, transfers, wires, check requests, etc.

-Receive/return all phone calls.

-Continuously update documentation in CRM.

-Handle all incoming and outgoing mail/UPS.

- Inventory and order office supplies

**Qualifications:**

-Preferably has prior knowledge of the financial planning industry.

-Extreme organizational skills

-Understands the ramifications of being in a service business.

-Consistently reliable and is a team player; works well with others.

-Accountable, quick learner who is proactive and demonstrates the ability to seek solutions to problems but knows when to ask for help/guidance.

-Ability to juggle multiple projects simultaneously and prioritize tasks across them and work independently in a fast-paced environment.

-Possess the ability to see multiple step tasks, be completed in their entirety.

-Upon learning the landscape, deductively be able to logically reach out to our various support departments in the Home Office and Product Sponsors

-Professionalism and a positive, can-do attitude throughout all tasks big and small

-Values organization and paying close attention to detail.

-Eager to learn &amp; take on new responsibilities, removing them from moving back to the investment professionals.

-Exhibits strong communication skills via phone and email communication.

-Proficient in Microsoft Office (Excel, Word, Google Docs)
