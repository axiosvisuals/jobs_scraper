**Position Summary:**  

We have an exciting opportunity to join our team as a Research Coordinator.
  

  

The Division of Epidemiology at NYU Langone Health is seeking a Research Coordinator for a new five-year study, Community-Based Evaluation of a Novel, System-Wide Harm Reduction Strategic Plan for People Experiencing Homelessness in New York City. Funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and led by Co-Principal Investigators (MPIs) Dr. Bennett Allen and Dr. Kelly Doran, this project is a community-partnered, mixed-methods research study to examine the implementation and impact of a large-scale harm reduction services portfolio (the DHS Harm Reduction Strategic Plan) into New York City single-adult shelters. The study will use epidemiological methods to estimate the impact of the harm reduction portfolio on fatal and nonfatal overdose and other drug-related health outcomes, machine learning methods to identify key sociodemographic subgroups of individuals for whom the interventions are most and least effective and identify optimal combinations of harm reduction services to reduce overdose and other health risks, and qualitative methods and in-depth interviews with shelter staff and clients to understand the implementation and sustainability of shelter-based harm reduction interventions, as well as client experiences of intervention reach and associated risk behaviors, to generate strategies to scale shelter-based harm reduction interventions in other jurisdictions. The study will be conducted in close collaboration with the NYC Department of Homeless Services.


The research team will work together with a Community Advisory Board that includes individuals with lived experience of homelessness. The study will identify challenges, assets, and innovations in harm reduction service delivery to generate durable lessons for the future that will be critical to reduce and prevent overdose among people experiencing homelessness in NYC and nationally.


The Research Coordinator will be responsible for providing support and project management in conjunction with the MPIs, government and community partners, research staff, and other investigators. The Research Coordinator will be critical for ensuring successful implementation of the study, filling a range of roles and meeting study goals while adhering to regulatory requirements and ensuring that deliverables are met effectively, on time, and are of high quality. The ideal candidate will be highly organized, adept in the conduct of research, and have research and community engagement experience. The Research Coordinator must be able to work autonomously, while maintaining good communication with the MPIs and study partners and collaborators. While the primary role for the Research Coordinator will be implementing the described CDC-funded study, we are seeking a candidate who would be excited to take on other roles as needed for different studies within Drs. Allen and Dorans respective portfolios through the Center for Opioid Epidemiology and Policy and the Health x Housing Lab.
