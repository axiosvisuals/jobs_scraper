Join the Mizuho team in Banking IT Support!
As part of the integration project to combine Mizuho & Greenhill banking businesses, there will be a significant increase in M&A deals in the Mizuho environment. Greenhill’s business has a significantly larger M&A banking footprint, and exists in multiple locations around the world. IT Banking needs to expand its support function to accommodate the increased business volume, and to ensure appropriate coverage for a global footprint.
A successful candidate should have 5-10 years of experience of supporting Investment Banking user technology platforms, ideally with exposure to the M&A/Advisory businesses. The role requires daily interaction with Bankers and related front-office business support functions (COO, risk & control, finance, etc.) as well as related infrastructure and development technology teams, and acts as the first point of contact for business support issues relating to the business applications.
Initially the role is that of an individual contributor in the Banking Technology team, but as the business expands, and requirements morph, the role may evolve into managing a distinct support function or capability for a suitably candidate.
Skill set* 5-10 years of experience in frontline application support at an Investment Bank or similar Financial Services firm (must have)
* Working knowledge of M&A/Advisory business would be a definite advantage
* Experience of Salesforce, or similar CRM tools would also be an advantage

*The expected base salary ranges from $105k-$170k. Salary offers are based on a wide range of factors including relevant skills, training, experience, education, and, where applicable, certifications and licenses obtained. Market and organizational factors are also considered. In addition to salary and a generous employee benefits package, successful candidates are eligible to receive a discretionary bonus.*

We thought it was important to share a bit more about what guides our decision-making and alignment among our team and partners.

Transparency

We are open with our customers and partners about our supply chain, our model, and why we do what we do. We have a real storefront (as opposed to a hidden back alley kitchen) and exist to tell stories freely about our partners, their vision and their food.

Quality

We are the dedicated operator for our brand partners, focused on delivering exceptional quality and experiences to our customers. Rather than licensing the brand to a disparate network of independent restaurants, Hungry House brings a maniacal focus on quality. When our partners win, we win.

Sustainability

At Hungry House, we’re building for the future. This means investing in waste reduction, composting, closed loop systems and finding ways to ensure that our planet remains hospitable to humans. It’s our responsibility as a business to ensure we are a part of working towards that future.

Diversity

As a female-founded company backed by diverse investors, we believe that diversity is not just a line item on some corporate manifesto, but rather a strategic advantage as we seek to partner with brands and people with their own unique stories. Hungry House is a platform for a multitude of communities to prosper, whether it be among our team members, our brand partners, our suppliers or other members of the community.

The duties of this position may change from time to time. Hungry House reserves the right to add or delete duties and responsibilities at the discretion of Hungry House or its managers.

A recently completed visitor survey reveals that 45% of visitors speak a language other than English at home. This fact underscores the importance of the mission and the challenges and opportunities QBG faces daily in creating programs, exhibits and landscapes that serve the needs of people who live in and visit one of the most ethnically diverse counties in the nation.

We thought it was important to share a bit more about what guides our decision-making and alignment among our team and partners.

Transparency

Quality

We are the dedicated operator for our brand partners, focused on delivering exceptional quality and experiences to our customers. Rather than licensing the brand to a disparate network of independent restaurants, Hungry House brings a maniacal focus on quality. When our partners win, we win.

Sustainability

At Hungry House, we’re building for the future. This means investing in waste reduction, composting, closed loop systems and finding ways to ensure that our planet remains hospitable to humans. It’s our responsibility as a business to ensure we are a part of working towards that future.

Diversity

As a female-founded company backed by diverse investors, we believe that diversity is not just a line item on some corporate manifesto, but rather a strategic advantage as we seek to partner with brands and people with their own unique stories. Hungry House is a platform for a multitude of communities to prosper, whether it be among our team members, our brand partners, our suppliers or other members of the community.

**Overview:**

Job descriptions are designed to provide Team Members with an opportunity to understand what specific duties, responsibilities and skills are required to be successful in their respective role within the company. The needs of the patient, Team Members and the Company are forever changing. Not every component of what is required can be defined precisely and the job description itself does not and cannot be all encompassing. All Team Members are expected to be flexible and willing to go beyond the minimum requirements outlined in the job description itself. Exhibiting a willingness to learn new tasks, supporting colleagues who may need assistance and living each of the company’s 5 Core Values will always be the key to success for our Team Members.

**Job Summary:**

Responsible for supporting every complex aspect of our Human Resources assets, including prospective, existing, and former Team Members, the Human Resources Manager has a direct and indirect impact on everyone: patient, current, past, and future Team Members, including members of the community we serve. The Human Resources Manager is the guardian of the Core Values, a healthy culture, and the relentless pursuit to create and maintain the company’s commitment to being an ‘employer-of-choice.’

Using genuine leadership skills and a kind demeanor, the Human Resources Manager takes ownership of every situation, performing well under stress and possessing the skills to communicate constructively and effectively with everyone.

Impactful leaders are acutely aware of the need for a healthy working environment and with a predictive sense of right and wrong; proactively take the necessary steps to address any ‘pain points’ and diffusing disruptive influences. The Human Resources Manager is a fearless champion of always doing what is right in any given situation with an innate sense of taking responsibility for their own shortcomings and learning from every opportunity.

The Human Resources Manager drives the hiring and retention processes, overseeing each component of talent acquisition, rehiring, the orientation processes, and off-boarding as needed. This role inherently supports growth and loyalty by recognizing top performers, assisting with performance reviews, and creating succession planning models intended to build bench strength within the organization. The Human Resources Manager works with the Director of Human Resources to clearly articulate Team Member responsibilities, creating and regularly updating positional job descriptions.

The department serves as a behind-the-scenes service to our Team Members where accurate payroll, benefits support, motivation, training, development, coaching, education, and morale are each as important as the other. The Human Resources Manager is accountable for supporting efforts to build and maintain a team of Human Resources professionals who emulate the behaviors set forth by Senior Leadership and align with the company’s business objectives.

**Personal and Professional Skills:**

Leaders must have excellent interpersonal skills required to maintain a positive rapport with clinical, clerical, inter-company Team Members, Regional, and Senior Leadership, local, state, and federal authorities and the community members.

Strong verbal skills are necessary to effectively communicate and highlight the objectives of the Company and provide hands-on Team Member education, training, and regular feedback regarding performance. Our Human Resources Manager is required to be dependable, knowledgeable, and able to work well in high pressure situations with the ability to diffuse or mitigate challenges as they occur.

This role requires a professional skillset that motivates and recognizes our internal top-performers, and proactively monitors, coaches, and guides any Team Members who are lacking or not meeting their potential. They ensure impartial fair treatment of everyone at every level, position, or tenure, without sacrificing standards. They demonstrate active listening by exhibiting positive body language, paying full attention to what others say, gauging body language and taking time for comprehension and asking questions with an open mind. Verbal and written skills are a pre-requisite for coaching sessions, Performance Improvement Plans, and timely reviews. Proficiency and a thorough knowledge with an ability to update, revise and interpret the handbook, and compliance with all policies and procedures must be maintained.

Required to sign a Confidentiality Agreement defines the role as one that has access to sensitive data and information. Investigations into the actions taken by anyone, regardless of position, may be required. Defending the company against claims, or establishing where fault occurred, whether valid or not, is expected. Ensuring that policies and procedures are communicated timely to protect the best interests of our patients, Team Members and company are essential. Holding themselves and others accountable to the same standards is fundamental.

The Human Resources Manager by oversees and makes recommendations for the modification for recruiting, hiring, and compensations structures that identify and support candidates to build a bench strength of future leadership, determining the need for internal and/or external hires. Executes regular monitoring of market conditions for staffing and the satisfaction of our workforce via surveys and other hands-on methods is measured by consistent improvement in both metrics.

As a leader, the Human Resources Manager must be able to navigate difficult and complex situations involving human interaction and, without any fear of retribution, be willing and able to communicate with impartiality and confidence to Senior Leadership any incident, trend or behavior that violates the company’s commitment to the five Core Values.

Are you looking for a opportunity where you can use your experience to propel your career into management? At New York Life, we will invest in you from the start to help you learn and grow as a financial professional first. We’ll train you in valuable skills, such as marketing, business development, and customer relationship management, and provide you with the tools you need to further your career. Then we’ll train you and provide you with access to the tools you need for a career in management.

**What we’re looking for**  
We’re looking for people who want to make a lasting impact on the financial well-being of individuals, families, and small businesses—motivated people who can answer yes to one of the following questions:

* Do you have sales or managerial experience in another industry?
* Have you previously run your own business?
* Do you have an MBA or other equivalent degree?

In the Accelerated Path to Management Program, you’ll start off as a financial professional, learning how to sell our products, building client relationships, and meeting specific requirements1 before transitioning into a management role.  
You’ll then undergo a six-month intensive training program designed to prime you for success as a manager. You will use that experience to understand how to recruit and coach others to success.

**What we offer**

**Your first year**  
You’ll learn firsthand about a financial professional’s role and day-to-day work by working as a financial professional for the first year of your career journey with New York Life. We will provide you with complete training, access to digital tools, and a comprehensive product suite.

**Training and resources**  
You will receive top-notch training that will give you an understanding and appreciation for the strength and value of  
New York Life. Beyond this training and support, New York Life will provide access to the resources you need to succeed day-to-day, including experts on hand to answer your questions and a suite of digital sales, prospecting and marketing tools that will help you attract and retain your clients with web, social and email content.

**Product Solutions**   
You will learn about our robust products and services that can help clients and their families achieve their financial goals.  
Together with its subsidiaries, New York Life provides a range of competitive insurance and financial products, including life insurance, annuities, long-term care insurance, disability income insurance, and investment products such as mutual funds through our broker-dealer, NYLIFE Securities LLC (member of FINRA and SIPC), a Licensed Insurance  
Agency. You will be required to hold securities licenses and FINRA registrations and affiliate with NYLIFE Securities as a registered representative before you can offer investment products.

**Your transition to a Field Manager role**  
After meeting specific requirements for the first 12 months as a financial professional, you will enter a specialized six-month Associate Partner training program. We’ll help you to lead and build your team of financial professionals.  
Throughout your career journey with New York Life, you’ll continue to have opportunities to grow and be promoted to increasingly senior levels of management.

**How we will compensate you**   
When you begin with New York Life as a financial professional2, you will receive income that is commission-based.3

If you meet the requirements and approvals to become an Associate Partner, you will receive a salary. The salary range for an Associate Partner is $60,000–$150,000 (in California, the salary range is $62,400–$150,000), plus you will be eligible for additional compensation related to the agents you recruit and develop (“R&Ds”). R&Ds are additional compensation that is designed to increase your income and to reimburse for any reasonable and necessary expenses we do not otherwise reimburse. You will also be eligible for medical, dental, and vision benefits, life, long-term disability, and accidental death and dismemberment coverages, a pension plan,4 and a 401(k) savings plan.5

New York Life will value and reward your hard work and success. You’ll have significant income potential over time, because our field managers’ compensation is directly aligned with their recruiting performance and the production level of their team of financial professionals. The average income among our 586 recruiters at all levels in 2021 was $270,890.6

The unique deeper learning model at HVA focuses on student independence, critical thinking, ethical leadership, intellectual curiosity, and intrinsic motivation. Serving 98% Black and Latino students, HVA consistently outperforms the district, city, and state by wide margins, and ranks at the very top of charter schools. 100% of HVA high school students earn admission to college each year, and 83% are the first in their families to attend college.

* Invest several hours per week in professional learning, including personalized instructional coaching, co-planning, department meetings, grade level meetings and other learning work
* Build strong, lasting relationships with students, inspiring them to hold themselves to a high standard of academics and character

### **Deeper Learning Institute**



Teachers are able to apply for the Deeper Learning Institute (DLI), a graduate program specifically for HVA educators. Attending DLI is an exceptionally unique opportunity to complete graduate work immersed in the study of deeper learning with a cohort of HVA colleagues. DLI is housed right here at HVA and courses are directly relevant to our teacher's daily practice. Completing DLI, a two year program, results in both a master's degree and certification in elementary (childhood grades 1-6 developmental level) and special education (students with disabilities).


### **Organizational Culture**



Our team is passionately committed to the vision and values of Harlem Village Academies. The ideal candidate will have a positive mindset, a very strong work ethic, an inner drive for excellence and will thrive working in an entrepreneurial and results-driven environment.
