------------



At Blank Street, we believe that rituals matter, and that great rituals make your life better. With coffee shops across the US and UK, we are working to transform the high street grab-and-go coffee transaction into an experience that is higher in quality, hospitality, and joy.


**What's Brewing…**
-------------------



Blank Street is seeking a highly talented and resourceful Supply Chain Analyst to support our dynamic supply chain team. As a member of the U.S. Supply Chain team, you will report to the Director of U.S. Supply Chain and play a critical role in managing our supply chain operations. This position requires a strategic thinker with a knack for data-driven decision-making, cross-functional collaboration, and forecasting. This position is ideal for those who excel in navigating and problem solving in fast-paced, often ambiguous scenarios and who are excited about learning the day-to-day operations of a fast-growing startup. This role is in-person at Blank Street's NY HQ office located in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.


**Our Values**
--------------


* **Magic is in the Details:** We value attention to detail in everything we do. We're always thinking about the small things that make a moment meaningful.
* **Move as One:** We value people who strive to be the best team player, not individual stars.
* **""My Home is your Home"" Hospitality:** We look for individuals who treat others the same way they'd treat a guest in their home. We care about presentation, hospitality, and having fun even when things are stressful.

**What You'll Own:**
--------------------


* **Sales and Operations Planning:** Lead the S&OP forecasting process by collaborating closely with Finance, Operations, and Strategy teams to align demand forecasts. Consider LTO/seasonal launches, and promotional activities. Continuously monitor and adjust demand forecasts to create a rolling 12-month supply chain procurement plan, communicating updates directly with key stakeholders such as coffee buyers and distributors.
* **Days on Hand Forecasting:** Analyze the daily consumption rates of each store's All-Day Breakfast and Pastry selections, accounting for potential demand shifts due to marketing activities, promotions, or increased foot traffic. Ensure accurate inventory orders to minimize out-of-stock (OOS) situations while reducing excess waste. Monitor Field slack channels for real-time insights and make timely inventory adjustments. Drive the ""Never Out of Stock"" initiative by ensuring 100% in-stock availability of critical inventory items by proactively managing inventory levels, anticipating demand fluctuations, and addressing supply chain disruptions to maintain seamless cafe operations.
* **On-Call Supply Chain Support:** Actively monitor Field-team-to-HQ Slack channels to triage and respond to concerns within an hour. Address issues like missing deliveries, incorrect items, or distributor access problems. Where feasible, take ownership of long-term solutions to prevent recurrence.
* **Distributor Catalog Management:** Manage online order catalogs for major distributors to ensure product availability for Field team orders. Track item OOS and swaps on distributor platforms and communicate promptly with the Field team to minimize downstream impacts. Ensure accurate inventory data across systems to prevent discrepancies between ordering platforms.
* **Inventory Management:** Develop and maintain a daily inventory tracking model to identify and address risky inventory positions proactively. Collaborate with the Field team to create optimized ordering guides, balancing working capital efficiency with limited storage capacity in stores.
* **Risk Management:** Proactively identify and mitigate supply chain risks by developing robust contingency plans for potential disruptions. This includes evaluating new vendors to reduce reliance on single sources, coordinating with suppliers to meet critical timelines, and partnering with R&D to find alternative ingredients.


**Who You Are:**
----------------


* **Analytical Skills -** Strong ability to analyze large data sets to identify trends, outliers, and patterns affecting supply chain performance.
* **Mathematical Modeling:** Proficiency in developing models for inventory optimization, transportation logistics, and cost analysis.
* **Attention to Detail -** Ability to manage multiple tasks simultaneously while maintaining a high level of accuracy and attention to detail.
