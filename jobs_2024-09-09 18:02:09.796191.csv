We’ve discovered a unique approach that significantly enhances the dining experience. **Our trial run with a Michelin-starred restaurant in NYC showed an astonishing 4,344% increase in bookings within just 2 hours**.

We're extending our Beta in NY and are **seeking 3 SDRs to help us acquire additional test users on a** **1-month project**. You’ll **work remotely at the hours of your choosing** to **invite New York residents & commuters to test our service**. In return, we ask for their feedback to help us improve our platform and the UX.

During this 1-month mission:

You will be part of a dynamic team, bringing our offer to market using creative on-the-ground strategies to engage potential users and encourage them to sign up. It will be a direct, face-to-face approach, that will include:

* Distributing cards with a QR code that links directly to the app's sign-up page to convert passersby into users.
* Visiting workplaces or office parks and encouraging employees to sign up directly.

**Top of Market Compensation & Growth Opportunities**

For this 1-month project we offer performance-based compensation, where your **earnings are tied to the number of sign-ups you generate**. On top of that, you’ll enjoy **perks like free meals at upscale restaurants**.

To clarify, you’ll have the **freedom to work from home and set your own hours**. We do not monitor or regulate how or when you work. However, please note that compensation is strictly tied to sign-ups—there is **no hourly pay for this 1-month project**. This model rewards those who dedicate at least 2 hours of work per day. On average, dedicating just 2 hours per day can earn you $2-3K, while **working 3-4 hours daily can easily result in $5-8K per month due to the attractiveness of our solution**.

Starting in **October 2024**, top performers will be offered a full-time contract with a monthly base salary of **$8K-$15K** (function of your performance), plus commissions and bonuses, as we prepare for our expansion.

**Please Note:**  
Do not apply unless you have at least **some experience** in a similar role.

**We encourage applications from students** who are eager to gain valuable experience and make a significant impact.

**Salary:** $ 27.47 (approximately $50,000 annually)

**Hours:** Monday through Friday - 35 hours per week


**Location:** On-site,Long Island City and Harlem

**The Organization:**


The Fortune Societys mission is to support successful reentry from incarceration and promote alternatives to incarceration, thus strengthening the fabric of our communities. We do this by believing in the power of individuals to change; building lives through service programs shaped by the needs and experience of our participants; and changing minds through research, education, and advocacy.

**Purpose of the Position:**


The DEST2nation study is a collaboration between Dr. Matthew Akiyama (Principal Investigator) of Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center and The Fortune Societys Center for Research, Inquiry and Social Justice (CRIS-J). Funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the study aims to 1) define a package of HIV status-neutral strategies focused on co-navigation, flexible, patient-centered testing and treatment options, and co-delivery of care, and 2) pilot the implementation of these strategies and prepare for testing them in a fully powered trial. Given the high HIV transmission risk upon return to the community, interventions to improve linkage to care and support for ART and PrEP engagement after incarceration are pivotal in efforts to end the HIV epidemic (EHE).


Under the supervision of the Project Manager, the Community Health Advocate (CHA) will work closely with the Einstein/Montefiore team to co-design and implement innovative status-neutral health interventions tailored to the needs of individuals impacted by the criminal legal system.


This role will be pivotal in synthesizing community feedback and ideas to construct a tailored, status-neutral intervention. The CHA will be instrumental in mobilizing and coordinating with community stakeholders, ensuring that their input and ongoing feedback shape the intervention throughout its phases. The CHA's responsibilities will include leading the execution of these strategies, continuously aligning the project's objectives with community needs, and ensuring the interventions' sustainability and adaptability. This dynamic position requires an individual capable of navigating complex interactions between research teams and community members, and turning community-centered designs into effective, real-world health interventions.

**Principle Duties and Responsibilities:**

* Actively participate in the co-designing of the intervention by organizing, attending, and co-facilitating stakeholder meetings, including sessions with the Community Advisory Board and other key stakeholders.
* Maintain meticulous records of all stakeholder meetings, ensuring detailed documentation and timely communication of the outcomes and action items to all relevant parties.
* Assist in synthesizing and disseminating key insights from stakeholder discussions to facilitate the continuous refinement of the intervention strategy.
* Provide comprehensive administrative support to ensure the smooth operation of the projects planning and execution phases.
* Implement the co-designed status-neutral intervention strategies, adjusting approaches based on stakeholder feedback and empirical outcomes.
* Engage with community members to solicit interest in participating in the study.
* Oversee and facilitate participant-led HIV testing processes.
* Serve as a liaison between clients and the Project Manager for study instrument (e.g., survey) completion and other procedural requirements.
* Ensure adherence to testing protocols and safety standards in collaboration with the Project Manager.
* Conduct detailed data entry and manage scheduling for project activities to ensure efficient workflow and adherence to project timelines.
* Synthesize and analyze data collected from various sources to inform ongoing project strategies and outcomes.
* Work closely with the Project Manager and the Einstein/Montefiore research team to monitor and report on project milestones and deliverables.
* Provide peer education and support, including (but not limited to) assisting clients in accessing medical care, insurance, and supportive housing.
* Perform additional duties as required by the project's evolving needs.

**Qualifications:**

* 1-2 years relevant work experience preferred.
* Prior health education experience preferred.
* Prior health education, specifically HIV and substance use, experience preferred.
* Comfort with administering surveys, including questions related to engagement in HIV risk behaviors and illicit substance use required.
* Comfort with handling testing samples required.
* Great communication skills required.
* Ability to work well on your own and be self-directed, but also keep supervisor updated and share information with a team.
* Approaches work with an attention to detail.
* Ambition to learn, develop health education skills, and seek out increased responsibilities.
* We seek talented, dedicated individuals from all walks of life who possess a strong commitment to this mission. Relevant personal experience is a plus.

**Core Competencies:**

***Mission, Culture and Fit*** Selected candidate must embody the values and mission of the Fortune Society. This includes meeting our participants where they are in the re-entry process, demonstrating our values through compassion and understanding; and affirming that none of us should be measured against the worse things we have done. Second chances are the Fortune Way.

***Communication*** - The CHA must possess exceptional writing, speaking, and listening skills, enabling clear, effective, and empathetic communication with participants, team members, and the broader Fortune community.

***Responsible Research Conduct*** The CHA will be thoroughly trained in study proStocols and ethical research guidelines. It is imperative that they adhere strictly to these standards to maintain the integrity and ethical conduct of the research.

***Data Collection and Entry*** The CHA is responsible for meticulous data collection and entry, ensuring accuracy and reliability in both Fortune's and the study's data tracking systems.

**Travel Requirements** Travel to Fortunes Long Island City office, Fortunes Harlem office, and designated project sites (e.g. other community-based organizations).


**Physical Demands (if applicable):**


To perform this job successfully, an individual must be able to perform each essential duty satisfactorily. The responsibilities and requirements listed are representative of the knowledge, skills, minimum education, training, licensing, experience and/or ability required. Reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the essential functions of the job.
