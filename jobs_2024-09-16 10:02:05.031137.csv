The Exit 4 Food Hall is the first of its kind in Westchester County offering local, freshly-prepared food and drinks. Here you can find a true dine-around experience among 9 different food stations — a throwback to one-stop dining. The food emphasizes locally-sourced and artisanal crafted items, with constantly changing menus featuring fresh and seasonal food. Our mantra is ""slow food....fast."" Exit 4 is also highly focused on providing a casual, fun and communal experience with an eclectic décor highlighted by one of a kind items with local ingredients prepared our way. We believe in sustainability and leaving the smallest carbon footprint possible-and a few examples of this in our everyday service is: serving our wine and beer on tap (no bottle waste); serving filtered water in our own glass, reusable bottles (no plastic bottle waste); and using Green Box (a box that serves as plates and gets smaller for left-overs) for our largest delivery/take-out item, pizza. We also make sure that any daily left-over food is distributed to our needy in the local community. We opened in February of 2016 to fill a need in our community. We support our community by giving the gift of food and supporting all local organizations. Please let us know about your experiences and how we can server you better.

### **About Us:**



We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.



We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.



Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day). ***This internship will take place from May - August (based on your summer schedule) and you will need to be able to work out of our SF or NY office during this time.***


### **About The Role:**



Mobile devices have reshaped personal computing—the power of a desktop now fits in our pockets. By giving everyone the building blocks to create their own tools, we'll solve more problems wherever we go. A delightful, intuitive mobile experience: that's our guiding light, and we need Android engineers to make it a reality.



During your 12-week internship, you will be paired with a mentor that will help guide you as you work closely with our team to build and ship impactful projects. These projects will drive valuable impact to our customers and engineers. From product engineering, mobile, to infrastructure and security, we have opportunities available on different teams. Take a look at what our past intern cohort worked on with our Blog post here and here and TikTok post.


### **What You'll Achieve:**


* Write clean, secure, tested, and documented code.
* You'll collaborate with the team to strategize, mold, and develop innovative features for our Android application.
* At our core, we prioritize crafting top-tier applications. Your role could involve enhancing the Android app's performance, reliability, and overall refinement. Additionally, you'll have the opportunity to optimize aspects of the app within the web stack.

### **Qualifications:**


* Pursuing a bachelor's or master's in computer science, engineering, or another related field. Targeting a 2026 full time start date and must graduate between Dec 2025 - Aug 2026.
* Previous mobile internship experience.
* Working towards a proficiency of one or more programming languages such as Kotlin, Swift, Java, Typescript, Node.js, Swift, Go, Python, or Rust.
* You find large challenges exciting and enjoy discovering problems as much as solving them.
* You are able to problem-solve and adapt to changing priorities in a fast-paced, dynamic environment.
* This internship will take place from May - September (based on your summer schedule) and you will need to be able to work out of our NY office during this time.

### **Skills You'll Need to Bring:**


* **Thoughtful problem-solving:** For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.
* **For a mobile internship:** You have a passion for Android or iOS development and are excited to work on large scale challenges with cutting-edge technology.
* **Put users first:** You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad.
* **Not ideological about technology:** To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.
* **Empathetic communication:** You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.
* **Team player:** For you, work isn't a solo endeavor. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same.

### **Nice to Haves:**


* You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Android SDK, Dagger, Swift, React, TypeScript, Postgres.
* You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.
* You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences.

Our customers come from all walks of life and so do we. We hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it makes our company stronger. If you share our values and our enthusiasm for small businesses, you will find a home at Notion.
