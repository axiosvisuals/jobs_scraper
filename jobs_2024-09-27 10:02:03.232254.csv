**Who exactly are UPS Tractor Trailer Drivers?**


First and foremost, they’re part of one strong, national team and are a key part of our operations. We refer to them as Feeder Drivers.

That includes $0 healthcare premiums, up to seven weeks of paid vacation, plus paid time off for holidays, sick leave and option days.

**About Us:**



Competitive triathletes and passionate bakers, Pam Weekes and Connie McDonald left their careers to open a small bread shop in New York City in 1995 — Levain Bakery.  

One day, they baked a BIG chocolate chip walnut cookie as energy for triathlon training. At Levain, a batch of these 6-ounce cookies flew off the shelves, and an icon was born. The cozy shop on West 74th Street became a neighborhood favorite and a destination for epicurious visitors from around the world, hungry for “the cookie.”  


From the start, Pam, Connie and team baked everything fresh on-site each day, donating the day’s leftovers to charity — and we still do, nearly 30 years later. Today, Levain has bakeries across the country (with more to come!), plus ecommerce gift boxes to treat cookie lovers in every state.  


Every day, we strive to embody our company’s five core values:
* Welcome All- *We are all in it together*
* Work Hard and Be Kind- *We pull our weight, we do our best, and take care of each other*
* Lead with Heart- *We operate with empathy and integrity*
