While the problems we solve at SIG are often different from academia, our problems demand the attention of brilliant minds that have an extraordinary attention to detail and a relentless pursuit of understanding.  

The general lifecycle of a quant project begins with an idea:* This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.
* As a Quantitative Researcher, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.
* Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.
* You will work side-by-side with technologists in order to backtest your results and put that trading signal into production.
* Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will continue to do research on that strategy in order to optimize its performance.
* As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.
* Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.


We have a comprehensive orientation program designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Education topics include an introduction to options pricing, exposure to our proprietary data sets, and opportunities to practice data analysis techniques. Beyond orientation, our trading floor serves as an unlimited source of discussion for learning and development. **What we're looking for**  

* PhD in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics
* Exceptional mathematical problem-solving skills
* Strong communication skills in a fast-paced and/or highly collaborative environment are essential
* Strong, practical computing skills; a specific language proficiency is less important than your ability to get computers to accomplish tasks efficiently and reliably
* Experience working on in-depth research projects
* Finance experience is not a requirement

  

By applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Systematic Trader position. There is no need to apply to both positions in order to be considered for both.  

Visa sponsorship is available for this position.  

The annual base pay range for this role is $200,000 - $225,000 + discretionary bonus + benefits. SIG considers factors such as scope and responsibilities of the position, work experience, education/training, key skills, as well as market and organizational considerations when extending an offer.

While the problems we solve at SIG are often different from academia, our problems demand the attention of brilliant minds that have an extraordinary attention to detail and a relentless pursuit of understanding.  

The general lifecycle of a quant project begins with an idea:* This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.
* As a Quantitative Researcher, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.
* Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.
* You will work side-by-side with technologists in order to backtest your results and put that trading signal into production.
* Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will continue to do research on that strategy in order to optimize its performance.
* As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.
* Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.


We have a comprehensive orientation program designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Education topics include an introduction to options pricing, exposure to our proprietary data sets, and opportunities to practice data analysis techniques. Beyond orientation, our trading floor serves as an unlimited source of discussion for learning and development. **What we're looking for**  

* Master's degree in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics
* Exceptional mathematical problem-solving skills
* Strong communication skills in a fast-paced and/or highly collaborative environment are essential
* Strong, practical computing skills; a specific language proficiency is less important than your ability to get computers to accomplish tasks efficiently and reliably
* Experience working on in-depth research projects
* Finance experience is not a requirement

  

By applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Systematic Trader position. There is no need to apply to both positions in order to be considered for both.  

Visa sponsorship is available for this position.  

The annual base pay range for this role is $200,000 - $225,000 + discretionary bonus + benefits. SIG considers factors such as scope and responsibilities of the position, work experience, education/training, key skills, as well as market and organizational considerations when extending an offer.  

SIG does not accept unsolicited resumes from recruiters or search firms. Any resume or referral submitted in the absence of a signed agreement will become the property of SIG and no fee will be paid.
