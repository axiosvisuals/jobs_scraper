No matter what position you are in, there are a few things that are critical to success – ensuring a safe work place, following company policies and procedures, maintaining confidentiality, upholding quality standards, and ensuring your uniform, personal appearance, and communications are professional. Guest Environment Experts will be on their feet and moving around (stand, sit, or walk for an extended time) and taking a hands-on approach to work (move, lift, carry, push, pull, and place objects weighing less than or equal to 50 pounds without assistance). Doing all these things well (and other reasonable job duties as requested) is critical for Guest Environment Experts – to get it right for our guests and our business each and every time.

**POSITION SUMMARY**

  



Our jobs aren’t just about giving guests a smooth check-in and check-out. Instead, we want to build and experience that is memorable and unique. Our Guest Experience Specialists take the initiative to deliver a wide range of services that guide guests through their entire stay. Their role goes beyond the traditional front desk to take ownership of the guest experience in the main areas of the hotel with a “guest first” mindset. They are empowered to move about their space and do what needs to be done. Whether processing operational needs, addressing guest requests, completing reports, delivering quality meals, or sharing the highlights of the local area, the Guest Experience Specialist makes transactions feel like part of the experience.

  



No matter what position you are in, there are a few things that are critical to success – creating a safe work place, following company policies and procedures, maintaining confidentiality, protecting company assets, upholding quality standards, and ensuring your uniform, personal appearance, and communications are professional. Guest Experience Specialists will be on their feet and moving around (stand, sit, or walk for an extended time) and taking a hands-on approach to work (move, lift, carry, push, pull, and place objects weighing less than or equal to 25 pounds without assistance; reach overhead and below the knees, including bending, twisting, pulling, and stooping). Doing all these things well (and other reasonable job duties as requested) is critical for Guest Experience Specialists – to get it right for our guests and our business each and every time.

Nuestro trabajo no consiste únicamente en servir comida en una mesa para que la disfruten nuestros huéspedes hasta el momento de pedir la cuenta. Además de eso, queremos crear una experiencia que sea memorable y única (dejando a un lado la comida y la bebida). Nuestros Expertos de servicio al huésped toman la iniciativa a la hora de ofrecer toda una serie de servicios orientados a que el huésped disfrute la experiencia. Ya sea cuando ponen las mesas, hablan con cocina, interactúan y sirven a los huéspedes o limpian las áreas de trabajo y de almacenamiento, los Expertos de servicio al huésped consiguen que las transacciones formen parte de la experiencia del huésped.

  

Al margen de cuál sea su puesto, hay una serie de cosas fundamentales para el éxito (crear un espacio de trabajo seguro, seguir las directrices y procedimientos de la compañía, mantener los estándares de calidad y asegurarse de que su uniforme, apariencia personal y comunicación sea profesional. Los Expertos de servicio al huésped están siempre en marcha (se ponen de pie, se sientan, andan durante largos ratos, se mueven por superficies con pendiente, que no siempre son uniformes y que a veces resbalan), revisan el menú (lo leen y verifican la información) y se implican en todo tipo de tareas (mover cosas, levantar, llevar, empujar y colocar objetos de menos de 50 libras sin ayuda; deben llegar a lugares altos y agacharse, y deben hacer movimientos que les obligan a doblar las rodillas, girarse, estirar y encorvarse). Es fundamental que los Expertos de servicio al huésped hagan siempre bien esas tareas (y otras tareas razonables que se les solicite) para que los huéspedes estén satisfechos y el hotel funcione.

At Ralph Lauren, we unite and inspire the communities within our company as well as those in which we serve by amplifying voices and perspectives to create a culture of belonging, ensuring inclusion, and fairness for all. We foster a culture of inclusion through: Talent, Education & Communication, Employee Groups and Celebration.  

**Position Overview**The **Analytics and Reporting Lead** will join a small team of business function process leads, IT domain leaders and the ERP vendor representatives known as the Program Initiation Team who will work together to take the first steps in this journey. The team will work closely together to achieve a set of the common objectives below ultimately leading to the initiation of the global program and the creation of all the articles needed to launch the project in 2025. This first, necessary step will ensure Ralph Lauren understands the key phases, impact, business resources and timeline required to begin the program. This is an opportunity to join one of the largest investments that the company will be making over the next decade, and we seek talent that is excited to help shape the future, being part of the journey and eventually taking this knowledge back into the business.


The purpose of this role is to work within a small team to manage the creation of a plan to implement the new ERP solution into RL. The role will involve working with the small team and the preferred ERP vendor to achieve the objectives below with the primary focus being to define the impact of the NGT ERP solution on the data and analytics capabilities and solutions currently within RL. In addition, the definition of an interim state and the migration package to support the gradual roll out is also required from this role. The objectives that this role will be responsible for include a, c, d and m focused specifically on the data analytics and reporting systems.


This role will be primarily focused on delivering the necessary work packages associated with the objectives to enable analytics and reporting to function as part of the NGT ERP implementation.

**Program Initiation Team objectives**

* Create a detailed and documented understanding of the current RL IT AS-IS application environment across all 3 regions. This includes all objects in scope for transition on both an interim and permanent basis. These objects include but are not limited to interfaces, data, reporting, access, third party systems as well as RL ERP and Edge systems.
* Create a detailed and documented understanding of the current RL IT AS-IS infrastructure environment across all 3 regions. This includes all infrastructure objects in scope for transition on both an interim and permanent basis.
* Creation of an interim state framework that outlines how the RL systems will need to be set up during the period of transition to the TO-BE status.
* Agree how the current systems will be maintained during this interim state identifying when investment will be reduced so that the existing platforms move into a maintenance only status.
* Definition of the migration package, toolset, scope and approach that will allow for the continued roll out of the new platform over the forthcoming years facilitating a smooth transition of the company as it gradually transitions over.
* Finalize the scope of the TO-BE ERP system, agreeing where the functionality will reside (ERP versus EDGE) within which system. This will also include mapping out the dependencies on the edge systems within RL at both a data object and interface level.
* Finalize infrastructure and related security solutions to support the TO-BE ERP system.
* Define the operational requirements to ensure that the new platform meets the needs of the business to meet the RTO/RPO agreements and that all the necessary reporting, alerting etc is in line with RL standards. This includes items such as automation in areas of data archiving, scheduling, alerting etc.
* Define the integration strategy and approach along with the detailed to create a seamless transition which provides flexibility and agility to provide a competitive advantage to the business going forward.
* Create an automated testing strategy identifying the approach and tools that RL should adopt to speed up the acceptance of the systems, increasing the quality, reducing the time to introduce new changes, enabling volume testing to simulate peak workloads. This approach will accommodate both RL generated functional and vendor system releases.
* Create an application documentation repository containing all information for both the AS-IS environment and the TO-BE systems going forward. The intent will be to create detailed information in an approved tool or framework that will be used ongoing throughout the project and beyond.
* Create an overview of the approach for data migration, outlining the plan, ownership, roles and responsibilities and any tools required to perform the cutover from the existing ERP systems including the interim state.
* Identify the impact of the new NGT ERP system on the data analytics and reporting capabilities within RL. Identify how the new solution will best integrate into the data analytics domain and outline the impact on current reporting solutions and how to remediate.
* Design and implement with the partnership of the NGT ERP SI and Information Security a clear Cyber Security framework for the Hybrid cloud design based on NIS and CIS standards.
* Create and implement the transition to support documentation with the TO-BE ERP system with clear RACI matrix between RL Technology I&O, Security, Applications, and the TO-BE ERP system provider.


As part of the transformation to the NGT ERP platform the existing 3 x ERP systems will be replaced. Not only do these systems provide the functional capability within the RL environment they also provide a significant amount of reporting that is used across the business for numerous reasons including day to day operational functions. With the replacement of the ERP, the impact of these changes needs to be fully quantified and a plan developed to provide the replacement data and/or information.


To support the development of the plan and subsequent investment case, a strategy to deploy the NGT ERP and create the subsequent reporting capability is required; therefore, the approach to be adopted is to catalogue the existing usage of data and analytics and determine the path forward. During the period of the NGT ERP deployment, there will be a significant period where the AS-IS environment and the TO-BE environment must co-exist together. This will require detailed reporting to be maintained across the two platforms, allowing the business to perform its regular reporting as well as maintain compliance with all regulatory requirements.


In addition, the rollout of the new platform will be performed on a regional basis, probably cutting over by country, therefore the migration to the new platform has to be considered very carefully across all channels. Defining the impact on the current reporting platforms and how this will be bridged is critical and creating an
agreed strategy and then the detailed plan is a major deliverable from this role. This role will work very closely with the RL IT application, business leads and vendor to define the approach for both of these areas.


Initially the role will focus on defining the current landscape, collecting all of the required information to describe the AS-IS environment. This will be across all 3 regions and will focus on the ERP systems, reporting, and data dependencies and structures. Agreement must be drawn up with the application domains to identify dependencies on reporting and analytics. Then the TO-BE environment must be considered, and a strategy and plan drawn up to support the analytics and reporting ongoing.


The strategy and plan must consider all aspects of the interim state and migration including reporting. Once the strategy is agreed the plan must create a series of work packages that specifies the level of effort required and then how the program will deliver the new capability This will include the definition of roles and responsibilities of how the service will be delivered and maintained. Working closely with the ERP vendor is crucial.


Support will be provided to plan and collect the information, managing the data collected and enabling the lead to focus on the activities, rather than the repository of information and the details to create the plan.


The role will also ensure that there are formal processes in place to sign off the data collected, with various gates being defined through the process to ensure that teams are bought into the approach. The migration lead will also be seen as an evangelist for the program, helping to educate, raise awareness, and grow confidence in those around them. They will become a focal point for the program and will generally help to raise the profile and understanding of the program within the company.

  


  

**Essential Duties & Responsibilities*** Work with all the IT, business, vendor teams to ensure the scope is clearly understood.
* Create a clear picture of the current AS-IS, documenting the data flows, reporting systems, data objects and dependencies and integration points for the current ERP systems by region.

	+ You’ll utilize balanced judgment in decisions about risks of both actions taken and not taken while innovating on ways to iterate faster in a well-managed way for the immediate team
	+ In addition to iteratively improving the platform, you’ll support internal customers in their everyday use of the platform to deliver initiatives that create business value

* ***Technology Driven***

* Your strong technical aptitude and understanding of big data practices will shape end-state architecture vision and help drive design decisions in partnership with engineering

* ***Integrated Problem Solving***


	+ You’ll strive for constant clarity in ensuring the “why” and “so what” behind behind all of your team’s work aligns to the product strategy
	+ You’ll incorporate considerations and inputs from many stakeholders, spanning business and technical domains, to inform holistic solutions and strategy

* ***Transformational Leadership***


	+ You’ll develop and communicate the vision, product strategy, and roadmap for batch data capabilities in Authorizations to senior leadership and stakeholders

Polaroid was founded in 1937 by one of the most seminal innovators of the 20th century, Edwin Land. His motto was, “don't undertake a project unless it is manifestly important and nearly impossible.” In 2008, Polaroid shuttered its last factory, but a group of diehard fans came together as The Impossible Project to save instant film. Over 10 years later that startup acquired what was left of Polaroid and today we’re again a small group of people passionate about changing the world through great products.
