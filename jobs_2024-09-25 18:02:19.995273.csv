**About Us:**



Founded in 2017 by Carolyn Witte and Felicity Yost, Tia is the modern medical home for women. We are trailblazing a new paradigm for women's healthcare that treats women as whole people vs. parts or life stages. Blending in-person and virtual care services, Tia's ""Whole Woman, Whole Life"" care model fuses gynecology, primary care, mental health and evidence-based wellness services to treat women comprehensively. By making women's health higher quality and lower cost, Tia makes women healthier, providers happier, and the business of care delivery stronger — setting a new standard of care for women everywhere.



Tia has raised more than $132 Million in venture capital funding to date, including a recent $100 Million Series B investment, one of the largest early-stage rounds ever for a healthcare company focused on women. Tia has ambitious plans to scale its ""whole-woman, whole-life"" model to more than 100,000 women by 2023. We'll do this by growing virtual and in-person operations in existing and new markets while expanding its service lines to care for women throughout their entire lives - from puberty to menopause. Since launching in 2017, Tia has grown to serve thousands of women aged 18-80 with blended in-person and virtual care in New York City, Los Angeles, Phoenix and soon San Francisco.



We're building a world class team to reimagine women's healthcare. We're an interdisciplinary team of clinicians, researchers, designers, technologists and operators who have seen firsthand how broken the healthcare system is for women. We're united by a powerful mission to enable every woman to achieve optimal health, as defined by herself, as well as a shared set of values and principles that define our business, products, and culture.



Tia is building a culture of **excellence** — in people, process and product. This is our northstar value;


*What is excellence, exactly?*



Excellence about constantly elevating yourself, it is the process of constantly striving to perform to the best of your abilities, and identifying your top potential through constant learning, experimentation and evolution. Excellence is not about achieving perfection, as that insinuates a pinnacle. Instead, in our terms, excellence is about the pursuit of constant improvement. We're looking for people who want to go on that hard journey of constantly setting new personal records, and organizational records.



We practice excellence at Tia by demonstrating the following types of behaviors: We chose (and actively choose) excellence as Tia's highest order value because it crystalizes into one word several behaviors that we hold dear, specifically:



* A drive to **constantly improve through experimentation**, reflection. and an insatiable growth mindset — said another way, we're energized by the possibility of invention, innovation, and iteration


* **Being present in and grateful for the journey** — not just the goal line. Perfection is static. Excellence is a process (more on this important distinction below)


* **Asking why, then why again** — because accepting ""this is just the way it is"" is not good enough


* **Grit & perseverance** — a maker mentality that involves ""rolling up your sleeves"", *but also* deep care for oneself and for others


* **A commitment to uncovering talents** to unlock ""rock star"" potential across every individual



Furthermore, excellence reflects the ""bigness"" and the ""boldness"" of Tia's mission and vision — a world in which every woman can achieve optimal health, as defined by herself.



Said another way, Tia's mission is NOT to make healthcare *incrementally better* for women. Instead, we've intentionally set out to create a fundamentally new paradigm for modern women's healthcare that's truly *excellent*. We believe that creating a company that operates in a culture of excellence will manifest in our product. Reaching this goal is not an overnight pursuit or a ""one and done."" We have not and will not ""get it right"" with the first swing. Rather, this higher order goal is a moving target — one we have not and will not ever fully ""achieve."" By design, we will never be ""done"" with this work, but instead, we will be continuously in pursuit of our mission. It is this continuous pursuit — the journey, not the finish line — that truly embodies excellence.


*This position may require attendance at company and team off-sites and is subject the Company's vaccine requirement, as permitted by law and subject to reasonable accommodation.*


*Tia is an equal opportunity employer. We are proud to foster a workplace free from discrimination. We strongly believe that diversity of experience, perspectives, and background will lead to a better environment for our employees and a better product for our users and patients. We strongly encourage people of color and members of the LGBTQ+ community to apply.*

**About Us:**



Warby Parker was founded with a mission: to inspire and impact the world with vision, purpose, and style.



We're constantly asking ourselves how we can do more and make a greater impact, and that starts by reimagining everything that a company and industry can be. We want to demonstrate that a business can scale while doing good in the world, without charging a premium for it. And we've learned that it takes creativity, empathy, and innovation to achieve that goal.



Since the day we launched in 2010, we've pioneered ideas, designed products, and developed technologies that help people see.

It is a requirement that all HCP receive the COVID-19 vaccination and annual seasonal influenza vaccination or obtain an exemption for medical or religious reasons. Wearing a face mask is required when an exemption has been granted. HCP in violation of these directives may face disciplinary action up to and including removal from federal service  

  

HCP for purposes of the influenza vaccination program are individuals who, during the influenza season, work in VHA locations or who come into contact with VA patients or other HCP as part of their duties.

Teachers may elect to lead an after-school extra-curricular club or coach a sport for an additional stipend. In the summer of the upcoming school year new teacher PD will begin on or around August 14, and the school year will begin in late August.
