About Clarks
  
Clarks, based in Somerset, England, has been at the forefront of innovative shoemaking since its foundation in 1825, when brothers James and Cyrus Clark made a slipper from sheepskin off-cuts. At the time it was ground-breaking: a combination of invention and craftsmanship that has remained at the heart of what the brand does now. In the Clarks archive of more than 22,000 pairs are shoes that have sparked revolutions and defined generations. From the original Clarks Desert Boot, first designed by Nathan Clark and launched in 1950, to the iconic Wallabee, each design has an instantly recognizable signature that makes it unmistakably Clarks.
  
**This season, we’re proud to introduce the Clarks Collective:** five incredible activists championing authentic social change. From mental health awareness and LGBTQ+ rights to greater racial equality, these trailblazers are committed to creating a brighter future for us all – bringing to life Clarks’ new global campaign, For the World Ahead. Through spotlighting their stories and supporting their chosen charities and initiatives, we’re ready to lead the way. After all, we’re originators, not imitators. It’s who we are, who we’ve always been. And to change the world of tomorrow, we’re doing things differently today.
  
Clarks International believes that the principle of equality of opportunity is fundamental to the company's operations. Our long held aim is to provide just and fair treatment for all employees. We will not discriminate on the grounds of sex, age, disability, marital status, colour, race, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation or gender reassignment.

Founded in 1991, Living Cities is a member collaborative of prominent foundations and financial institutions. We foster transformational relationships across sectors and connect leaders, stakeholders, and policy influencers committed to closing racial income and wealth gaps in America’s cities. We partner with cross-sector leaders in cities across the country to imagine and create an America in which all people are economically secure, building wealth, and living abundant, dignified, and connected lives. Our staff, investments, convenings, and networks support efforts that operationalize racial equity and inclusion in local government, create inclusive narratives, bring communities together to strategically address systemic racial inequities and build wealth among BIPOC communities through specific tactical pathways, i.e., entrepreneurship, homeownership, and access to capital.

Living Cities harnesses the collective and collaborative power of philanthropy, financial institutions, and local governments to close racial income and wealth gaps in U.S. cities. Our committed membership, leadership, staff, community network, partners, investments, and strategic direction all support our efforts to eliminate systemic barriers and inequities in entrepreneurship and business growth, access to capital, and homeownership for Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). Our shared vision is that people in U.S. cities are economically secure, building wealth, and living abundant and connected lives.

TEAMS AND INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITIES

The Homeownership program works with our members, cities, and partners to increase access to and preservation of homeownership to sustain and grow wealth.

The ideal candidate is adept at independent research, collecting and synthesizing data and information to identify trends, themes, and innovative approaches and ensuring the information is accessible to various audiences, internally and externally. Thus, the candidate has excellent written and verbal communication skills.

Business Ownership and Strategy

Living Cities' Business Ownership strategy focuses on creating equitable wealth-building opportunities via business ownership by increasing the flow of financial, knowledge and social capital to firms owned by Black, Latino, Indigenous and other people of color. We do this by building connections between national funders, Business Serving Agencies within city governments and Community Based Capital Allocators.

================


Garden (gardenintel.com) accelerates global technological development by fixing the patent system. We're building AI-powered search and analysis tools to make the patent process less painful and more effective for R&D organizations, inventors, prosecutors, and litigators. Our core product, Patentbreaker, is a groundbreaking 102/103 prior art search tool that automates the generation of claims charts for inter-partes reviews.


Leading companies, law firms, and research organizations are already seeing huge efficiency gains from our tools, and we were able to monetize a couple weeks into deploying. But this is just the beginning - our vision is to leverage AI, rich data, and scalable analysis to drive smarter R&D investment decisions across industries. The patent system today is overwhelmed by the explosion of filings, fragmented across service providers, and inaccessible to many inventors. We're here to change that. Our early traction has been incredible, with hundreds of users, a growing enterprise waitlist, and key advisors bought into our mission. Recently, we raised a $6.8m seed round from Spark Capital, Craft Ventures, and top angel investors.


We're a tight-knit, ambitious team of experts in NLP, patents, and product development. We’re incredibly customer obsessed, work in the office 5-6 days a week, and ship on tight timelines. We are a mix of research and product in our work, and seek to find members of our team that are excited by both in a burgeoning industry.


The opportunity is huge, the problem is urgent, and the team is top-notch. If you're an exceptional full-stack/backend engineer who wants a high-impact role at a fast-moving AI startup, we'd love to chat. At Garden, you won't just grow as an engineer - you'll help plant the seeds for a better innovation ecosystem.

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/U--haul","http://www.uhaul.com/","2727 North Central Avenue

At Charles Tyrwhitt our purpose is to “Make it easy for men to dress well” and we can’t do that without our team members. At this time, we’re on the lookout for an experienced Sales Associate who will be working with Arthur from our 6th Ave store location.

**What you will be doing**


You will be responsible for providing exceptional customer service and be the touch point for each and every customer. Our Sales Associates will be provided training to support our clients with styling and fit advice, as well as tailoring and custom product sales service. Your natural interest in providing exceptional service will mean you always put the customer first, providing a warm welcome to our shop, always representing the CT Brand.

**What we are looking for**


We are looking for a confident Sales Associate who can connect with our customers, deliver excellence in customer experience, and offer advice on current trends relevant to our clientele. Previous experience in a similar position is a huge advantage to this role. Interest in menswear is necessary, plus training is provided to help you understand our brand.

**What you can expect from us**


CT is a privately-owned business, so we're not a big corporate-style place to work. Our senior leaders are transparent and approachable, and we welcome ideas to make this a great place to work. We value our people whilst being product and customer obsessed.

* Quarterly bonus based on team sales performance
* Part-time paid sick leave!
* Uniform allowance
* PayActiv partnership - get wages already earned before payday
* Employee discount

  

This is an hourly (non-exempt) role based in New York City. The pay range for this role is based on experience and we might reasonably expect to offer $17.00 - $18.50 per hour.

**Who we are**


Once upon a shirt, Nicholas Charles Tyrwhitt Wheeler had the notion that he could make a better shirt at better value than anyone else in the world! He believed that all men; no matter their shape or size, where they may be in the world or indeed their budget; should be able to own a Jermyn Street quality shirt. A proper shirt. A CT shirt.


That was over 3 decades ago and whilst Charles Tyrwhitt (it rhymes with spirit by the way) is still famous for proper shirts, these days we are about so much more than collars and cuffs. Our purpose is to “make it easy for men to dress well”. We take care of the entire wardrobe, providing stylish solutions for every occasion. We make sure he gets what he wants, when and how he wants it.


Charles Tyrwhitt’s spiritual home and flagship store is located on London’s Jermyn Street, in the United Kingdom where our presence is well know. We also have a strong online presence in the US, with retail stores in 7 states and a New York head office. We also operate across Europe and Australia! Pretty impressive, eh? And as of 2022, we're proud to be recognized as a carbon-neutral retailer as we continue our journey to be a sustainable business.

**‘I am Proud and Free to be me!’**


Tyrwhitteers (our people) are a diverse, passionate and entrepreneurial group. We enjoy a fun, engaging and rewarding culture, where everyone is empowered by our 3 BE-liefs which are; “BE the BOSS”, “BE the CUSTOMER” and “BE the BEST”.

**The Opportunity**



CEO is currently seeking to hire an Job Developer for our local office, a role that's crucial to CEO's work to help individuals coming out of incarceration regain the skills and confidence needed for a successful transition to stable and productive lives.



Job Developers increase the range of employment opportunities available to our participants using participant interests, experiences, and their ambitions as foundation for participant job placements, and more broadly, for the identification and cultivation of potential employers for prospect portfolios.



The most rewarding part of being an Job Developer is the joy you feel upon making the ""right fit"" match between participant and employer. Your expertise and insight lead not only to successful matches in the now, but to participant longevity in the workforce which often drastically reduces the rate of recidivism.



As part of our mission, we strongly encourage individuals who have lived experience of incarceration or involvement in the justice system to apply for this role.


**Who We Are**



The Center for Employment Opportunities (CEO) provides employment services to people recently released from incarceration. Across the United States, 8,000-9,000 people participate in CEO each year, transitioning to employment that supports themselves, their families, and their communities.



What began as a demonstration project of the Vera Institute of Justice in the 1970s to address employment barriers facing the formerly incarcerated following release in New York City has grown into the leading reentry employment organization in the country, where over 30,000 formerly incarcerated individuals have secured full-time employment since 1996.


**Who You Are**


* You're deeply dedicated to social justice and perhaps are already working in the re-entry space
* You come to CEO with experience in workforce development, recruitment, or sales/account management, a role in which you needed to meet performance goals on a regular basis

* You have excellent interpersonal and written communication skills with the ability to adjust to particular personalities and interaction styles on the spot
* You're resilient and never give up, anticipating and addressing challenges along the way while keeping your eye on the end goal
* You're comfortable working under pressure and meeting deadlines despite opposition or setbacks
* You're able to look at a set of data or market research and use it to guide your practice and decision-making

***Relationship Cultivation and Maintenance***


* Research, conduct outreach to, and build relationships with prospective employers willing to hire CEO participants and who have hiring needs that match the skills, experience, and interests of our overall participant cohort
* Maintain relationships with existing employer partners
* Schedule and conduct daily prospecting, cold calls, and face-to-face meetings
* Serve as the liaison among employers, participants, and our criminal justice partners


***Job Placement***


* You are expected to produce up to 6-10 direct placements a month
* Screen and match program participants with employment opportunities, taking into consideration each participant's skills, work experience, interests, and goals and aspirations
* Customize participants' resumes to fit identified opportunities
* Manage a caseload of participants, support and coach them around applying for jobs, navigating the hiring process, and finding and securing right fit employment


***Administrative Support***


* Document all participant and employer contact, activities, and outcomes in our case management system (Salesforce)
* Perform other job-related duties and responsibilities assigned from time to time


**Compensation and Benefits**



The salary for this position is **$57,500**. In an effort to be both equitable and transparent, CEO's compensation philosophy considers a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, experience, internal equity, and home office location in making a final determination on our salary offer.



We recognize that salary is a part of the overall compensation package and also provide a comprehensive benefits package, including medical and dental coverage, as well as professional development opportunities and training, including regular training opportunities in Motivational Interviewing (MI). MI is one evidence-based skill that reentry and human service professionals can utilize when supporting participants to achieve their goals.



We also offer paid parental leave, participation in a retirement plan, sick and vacation leave, paid holidays and more. We are a workplace that promotes continual learning and teamwork, offering lunch and learns, team outings, holiday gatherings and more for our staff.


**More About Us**



The Center for Employment Opportunities believes that everyone deserves the chance to shape a stronger future for themselves, their families, and their communities.
