**Tasca Family Commitment**
===========================


Tasca Automotive Group was founded in 1943 by Bob Tasca, Sr. In 1953 Bob opened the original Tasca Ford in Bristol, Rhode Island. Just one year later this dealership was completely destroyed by Hurricane Carol. Bob relocated and ultimately opened up the new Tasca Ford at 777 Taunton Avenue in East Providence, Rhode Island. It was here that Bob and his team became the second largest Ford dealership in the world in the 1960's. This was also the birthplace of the Tasca Racing program and many historic muscle cars such as the Ford Cobra Jet, Tasca Street Boss, and Mystery race cars.  


  

  

Bob opened Tasca Lincoln Mercury in Seekonk, Massachusetts in 1972. TLM became the highest volume Lincoln Mercury dealership in the world in 1986, and repeated again in 1987 and 1988 while also winning the Ford President's Award for outstanding customer satisfaction. This fulfilled Bob's dream of saying ""None Bigger, None Better."" It was also at the Seekonk store that Bob launched the innovative Pre-Trade program, pioneering the concept of short term trade cycles and leasing. He was also joined in the business by his three sons, thus fulfilling another of his dreams to build a successful family business.  


  

  

In 2002 Bob opened his flagship dealership in Cranston, RI. Featuring Ford, Lincoln, Mercury, Mazda, and Volvo the Cranston location was one of the most high tech and largest facilities in the country. It featured amenities such as drive in service write up, an in house Italian café, drive through carwash, and spacious customer lounge. It was at this time that Bob was joined in the business by his grandsons and granddaughters, continuing his dream of a family business. When Bob Tasca, Sr. passed away in 2010 he left a proud legacy of honesty, integrity, and customer satisfaction.  


  

  

70 years and three generations later the Tasca Family continues to grow. We have been blessed over the past seven decades with great customers and great employees. We would like to thank the members of our team who continue to work so hard to satisfy our customers. We would also like to thank the thousands of families who have trusted us over the past 70 years. We humbly look forward to keeping our commitment that YOU WILL BE SATISFIED.

The work hours can be long and physically demanding, so employees may find the job tiring. The restaurant environment is likely to be noisy and busy, which can all be stressful.

Stamina and physical strength are also important, as employees are expected to lift and carry heavy items regularly (at least 25 lbs). Leaders may be expected to start work very early or work at night. Team morale and positivity are very important and a part of the Chick-fil-A culture.


Working at a Chick-fil-A® restaurant is more than a job – it’s an opportunity for teamwork and leadership development in a positive, people-focused environment.

Summer 2025 Bartley Fellowship - Arts Criticism Internship


Job Description:


The Wall Street Journal's Arts in Review section is seeking aspiring journalists—juniors, seniors or recent graduates with reporting and writing backgrounds at their school newspapers or elsewhere—for a 10-week paid summer internship. The in-person internship is an opportunity to get hands-on experience working alongside some of the best opinion writers and editors in the world.


Our internships—formally, the Bartley Fellowships—honor our section's former editor, Robert L. (Bob) Bartley. Opportunities will be awarded to young thinkers and writers who intend to pursue a career in journalism or cultural criticism.


The Arts interns are among several fellows selected each year through an application process that is overseen by senior editors. Bartley Fellows will be assigned to a department within the Opinion section—Arts in Review; Book Reviews; or Features (Op-Eds and Columns). The fellow(s) selected to work with the Arts team will assist in researching, fact-checking and editing content for the print and digital editions of the Journal, contributing to social media and digital production, and will be encouraged to write for the Masterpiece column. They may also submit ideas for articles or projects to editors in any part of the Opinion section.


Internships are paid, and generally take place during June, July and August, though start dates can be flexible.


If you are interested in applying for the Opinion, Books, Arts, and Social Media Bartley Fellowships, please submit separate applications for each position.


Guidelines and Application Deadline


Though a reporting and/or writing background is a plus, the fellowship is primarily an editing internship. Therefore applicants should have experience editing arts or arts-related copy for their college newspaper, literary magazine, or a comparable publication. Students from any discipline may apply, but preference will be granted to those concentrating in literature, history, a foreign language, classics, pre-law, music, theater, art history, studio art, architecture, philosophy, political science or archaeology—via coursework (though not necessarily a major) or sustained leisure-time activity.


An appreciation for both the Western and non-Western canons is desirable, as is an understanding of current issues in the arts. A demonstrated ability to multitask and meet daily deadlines is critical for success, as is attention to detail and a focus on accuracy. Applicants should be familiar with technology as it relates to journalism. Social media experience with a publication or brand would be a plus.


Applicants will be expected to demonstrate familiarity with our section’s content (student applicants without campus-wide access to the WSJ can purchase discounted subscriptions at https://www.wsj.com/studentoffer).


If you’d like to be considered, please submit the following in one single, complete PDF file:


* A cover letter
* Your résumé
* Links to or cited full text of your two best clips
* Your response to the following prompt in no more than 800 words:

Write a “Masterpiece” column. In these essays that appear every Saturday, a writer discusses a single work of art (painting, book, film, etc.) and explains why, in their view, it is of surpassing cultural significance. (Examples: https://www.wsj.com/news/types/masterpiece)


All materials must be received by December 2, 2024. Only complete applications that include a cover letter, résumé and prompt responses will be considered. Please do not include any additional materials, such as transcripts, recommendation letters, etc. In order to be considered, you must be a U.S. citizen, or a holder of a green card or visa that will allow you to work in the United States. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis and we endeavor to make selections by the end of January. Only finalists will be contacted.


About Arts in Review


Criticism of the arts are recognized at the Journal as Editorial Page functions, and as such operate under the umbrella of the Opinion section. Like the rest of the Opinion section, in our Arts reviews we believe in rendering clear, independent judgments that are as well argued as they are deeply informed.


In its Arts reviews, the Journal covers the full spectrum, from high art to TV, movies, theater and the many forms of popular music. Our approach is strictly art-for-art’s-sake: We review things because they are intrinsically interesting, not to fulfill a quota. We believe in the past and its traditions, but are keenly interested in the new—not in novelty for its own sake but in the ways those traditions are being extended and new ones invented. And we prize above all a lively, lucid prose style free from jargon of all kinds.


About Bob Bartley


Throughout his 30 years as The Wall Street Journal’s Editorial Page Editor, Bob Bartley inspired principled and original thinking that changed and shaped the society in which we all live. He also devoted attention to teaching and motivating talented young people, many of whom have gone on to careers in journalism at the Journal and elsewhere. The Bartley fellowships are consistent with that legacy.


Bob Bartley achieved many honors during his long tenure here, including a Pulitzer Prize and, shortly before his death in December 2003, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In awarding that medal, President Bush cited Bob as “one of the most influential journalists in American history.” The Robert L. Bartley fellowships will help to perpetuate not just Bob’s memory but, above all, the principles and priorities to which he devoted his distinguished career.


About the Opinion Section


Following the American newspaper practice, the heads of News and Editorial report independently to the publisher of the Journal and CEO of Dow Jones, Almar Latour. The Editorial staff is responsible for the Opinion content published on WSJ.com, the editorial and op-ed pages of The Wall Street Journal in print, and criticism of books and the arts, which are recognized at the Journal as an Opinion function.


While The Wall Street Journal’s news pages are committed to informing our readers, our editorials are dedicated to advocating a consistent philosophy and positions that emanate from it. That philosophy can be summed up as “free markets, free people.” We have stood for these fundamental principles even in times - and places - when they were not considered fashionable. While specific issues differ in various parts of the world, we view those issues through a consistent lens everywhere; for example, while protectionism is more popular in some parts of the world than others, our publications around the world are committed uncompromisingly to free trade.


We believe in the individual, in his wisdom and his decency. We oppose all infringements on individual rights, whether they stem from attempts at private monopoly, labor union monopoly or from an overgrowing government. Our section is not easily pigeonholed or predictable. We resist the label “conservative,” in the sense of preserving the status quo, because we think it too confining, too devoid of the optimism inherent in trusting individual wisdom and decency.


It is also important to state clearly what our section does not represent. It is not partisan. Unlike many American publishers, we do not endorse political candidates, and from time to time we have important disagreements with all leading political figures. We view issues through the lens of our philosophy and let our readers decide which person or party best serves to protect market capitalism and self-government.


We believe that the ultimate function of opinion journalism is the same as the rest of the newspaper, to inform. But in opinion journalism we have the additional purpose of making an argument for a point of view. We often take sides on the major issues of politics and society, with a goal of moving policies or events in what we think is the best direction for the country and world. Our experience over many years is that even those of you who disagree with us on particular issues - or even on broader philosophical grounds - nevertheless respect us for the clarity, consistency and eloquence with which we present our point of view. In stating our own views forcefully, we hope to raise and sharpen the level of debate and knowledge. And we hope that our editorials reflect not merely the passing whim of passing editors, but a body of thought shaped by a century of tradition.

------------



At Blank Street, we believe that rituals matter, and that great rituals make your life better. With coffee shops across the US and UK, we are working to transform the high street grab-and-go coffee transaction into an experience that is higher in quality, hospitality, and joy.


**What's Brewing…**
-------------------



Blank Street is seeking a highly talented and resourceful Supply Chain Associate to support our dynamic supply chain team. As a member of the U.S. Supply Chain team, you will report to the Director of U.S. Supply Chain and play a critical role in managing our supply chain operations. This position requires a strategic thinker with a knack for data-driven decision-making, cross-functional collaboration, and forecasting. This position is ideal for those who excel in navigating and problem solving in fast-paced, often ambiguous scenarios and who are excited about learning the day-to-day operations of a fast-growing startup. This role is in-person at Blank Street's NY HQ office located in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.


**Our Values**
--------------


* **Magic is in the Details:** We value attention to detail in everything we do. We're always thinking about the small things that make a moment meaningful.
* **Move as One:** We value people who strive to be the best team player, not individual stars.
* **""My Home is your Home"" Hospitality:** We look for individuals who treat others the same way they'd treat a guest in their home. We care about presentation, hospitality, and having fun even when things are stressful.

**What You'll Own:**
--------------------


* **On-Call Supply Chain Support:** Actively monitor Field-team-to-HQ Slack channels to triage and respond to concerns within an hour. Address issues like missing deliveries, incorrect items, or distributor access problems. Where feasible, take ownership of long-term solutions to prevent recurrence.
* **Distributor Catalog Management:** Manage online order catalogs for major distributors to ensure product availability for Field team orders. Track item OOS and swaps on distributor platforms and communicate promptly with the Field team to minimize downstream impacts. Ensure accurate inventory data across systems to prevent discrepancies between ordering platforms.
* **Inventory Management:** Develop and maintain a daily inventory tracking model to identify and address risky inventory positions proactively. Collaborate with the Field team to create optimized ordering guides, balancing working capital efficiency with limited storage capacity in stores.

Summer 2025 Bartley Fellowship - Book Review Internship


Job Description


The Wall Street Journal's Book Review section is seeking beginning journalists—juniors, seniors or recent graduates with reporting and writing backgrounds at their school newspapers or elsewhere—for 10-week paid summer internships in our New York City office. The in-person internships are an opportunity to get hands-on experience working alongside some of the best opinion writers and editors in the world.


Our internships—formally, the Bartley Fellowships—honor our section's former editor, Robert L. (Bob) Bartley. Opportunities will be awarded to young thinkers and writers who intend to pursue a career in journalism or cultural criticism.


The Books interns are among several fellows selected each year through an application process that is overseen by senior editors. Bartley Fellows will be assigned to a department within the Opinion section—Arts in Review; Book Review; or Features (Op-Eds and Columns). The fellow(s) selected to work with the Books teams will assist in commissioning reviews, researching, fact-checking and editing content for the print and digital editions of the Journal, contributing to social media and digital production, and will be encouraged to submit their own ideas for exhibitions or other cultural events to review. They may also submit ideas for articles or projects to editors in any part of the Opinion section.


Internships are paid, and generally take place during June, July and August, though start dates can be flexible.


If you are interested in applying for the Opinion, Books, Arts, and Social Media Bartley Fellowships, please submit separate applications for each position.


Guidelines and Application Deadline


Though a reporting and/or writing background is a plus, the fellowship is primarily an editing internship. Therefore applicants should have experience editing arts or arts-related copy for their college newspaper, literary magazine, or a comparable publication. Students from any discipline may apply, but preference will be granted to those concentrating in literature, history, a foreign language, classics, pre-law, music, theater, art history, studio art, architecture, philosophy, political science or archaeology—via coursework (though not necessarily a major) or sustained leisure-time activity.


An appreciation for both the Western and non-Western canons is desirable, as is an understanding of current issues in the arts. A demonstrated ability to multitask and meet daily deadlines is critical for success, as is attention to detail and a focus on accuracy. Applicants should be familiar with technology as it relates to journalism. Social media experience with a publication or brand would be a plus.


Applicants who are able to demonstrate familiarity with our section’s content will be especially attractive (student applicants without campus-wide access to the WSJ can purchase discounted subscriptions at https://www.wsj.com/studentoffer).


If you’d like to be considered, please submit the following in one single, complete PDF file:


* A cover letter
* Your résumé
* Links to or cited full text of your three best clips
* Your response to the following prompt in no more than 800 words:

Make a case for any book of your choosing on history, fiction or nonfiction. (Examples: https://www.wsj.com/news/types/bookshelf)


All materials must be received by December 2, 2024. Only complete applications that include a cover letter, résumé and prompt responses will be considered. Please do not include any additional materials, such as transcripts, recommendation letters, etc. In order to be considered, you must be a U.S. citizen, or a holder of a green card or visa that will allow you to work in the United States. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis and we endeavor to make selections by the end of January. Only finalists will be contacted.


About Book Reviews at The Wall Street Journal


Books criticism is recognized at the Journal as an Editorial Page function, and as such operates under the umbrella of the Opinion section. Like the rest of the Opinion section, in our book reviews we believe in rendering clear, independent judgments that are as well argued as they are deeply informed.


The Journal’s Book reviews are among the most timely, most widely read and most influential in American literary journalism. Our daily reviews are part of the Opinion section, and focus on nonfiction books of interest to ambitious readers of politics, business, science, religion and the issues of the day. Our weekend reviews, which make up a stand-alone six-page Books section in print, offer judicious criticism of the best of the week’s new titles in a broad cross-section of subject areas, from the fine arts and literary fiction to popular culture, narrative nonfiction, children’s books and more. In all we do, our goal is simple: to cut through the noise of hype and publicity to identify true excellence in publishing-and then match it with excellence in reviewing.


About Bob Bartley


Throughout his 30 years as The Wall Street Journal’s Editorial Page Editor, Bob Bartley inspired principled and original thinking that changed and shaped the society in which we all live. He also devoted attention to teaching and motivating talented young people, many of whom have gone on to careers in journalism at the Journal and elsewhere. The Bartley fellowships are consistent with that legacy.


Bob Bartley achieved many honors during his long tenure here, including a Pulitzer Prize and, shortly before his death in December 2003, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In awarding that medal, President Bush cited Bob as “one of the most influential journalists in American history.” The Robert L. Bartley fellowships will help to perpetuate not just Bob’s memory but, above all, the principles and priorities to which he devoted his distinguished career.


About the Opinion Section


Following the American newspaper practice, the heads of News and Editorial report independently to the publisher of the Journal and CEO of Dow Jones, Almar Latour. The Editorial staff is responsible for the Opinion content published on WSJ.com, the editorial and op-ed pages of The Wall Street Journal in print, and criticism of books and the arts, which are recognized at the Journal as an Opinion function.


While The Wall Street Journal’s news pages are committed to informing our readers, our editorials are dedicated to advocating a consistent philosophy and positions that emanate from it. That philosophy can be summed up as “free markets, free people.” We have stood for these fundamental principles even in times - and places - when they were not considered fashionable. While specific issues differ in various parts of the world, we view those issues through a consistent lens everywhere; for example, while protectionism is more popular in some parts of the world than others, our publications around the world are committed uncompromisingly to free trade.


We believe in the individual, in his wisdom and his decency. We oppose all infringements on individual rights, whether they stem from attempts at private monopoly, labor union monopoly or from an overgrowing government. Our section is not easily pigeonholed or predictable. We resist the label “conservative,” in the sense of preserving the status quo, because we think it too confining, too devoid of the optimism inherent in trusting individual wisdom and decency.


It is also important to state clearly what our section does not represent. It is not partisan. Unlike many American publishers, we do not endorse political candidates, and from time to time we have important disagreements with all leading political figures. We view issues through the lens of our philosophy and let our readers decide which person or party best serves to protect market capitalism and self-government.


We believe that the ultimate function of opinion journalism is the same as the rest of the newspaper, to inform. But in opinion journalism we have the additional purpose of making an argument for a point of view. We often take sides on the major issues of politics and society, with a goal of moving policies or events in what we think is the best direction for the country and world. Our experience over many years is that even those of you who disagree with us on particular issues - or even on broader philosophical grounds - nevertheless respect us for the clarity, consistency and eloquence with which we present our point of view. In stating our own views forcefully, we hope to raise and sharpen the level of debate and knowledge. And we hope that our editorials reflect not merely the passing whim of passing editors, but a body of thought shaped by a century of tradition.
