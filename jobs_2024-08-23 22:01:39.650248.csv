New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation

**Outposted Therapeutic Housing Units Program (OTxHU)**


Since 2016, Correctional Health Services (CHS) has been the direct provider of health care in the New York City jails. Deeply committed to human dignity and patient rights, CHS is part of the NYC Health + Hospitals system and is a key partner in the City’s efforts to reform the criminal-legal system. Our in-jail clinical services include medical, nursing, and mental health care; pharmacy services; substance-use treatment; social work; dental and vision care; discharge planning; and reentry support.


Given the high visibility of this initiative, we are seeking the highest caliber health care professionals in key clinical services to staff our Outposted Therapeutic Housing Units (OTxHU). To be located in three NYC Health + Hospital acute care facilities, the OTxHU is a pioneering approach to safely increasing access to high quality clinical care for patients in custody who have complicated health conditions. OTxHUs will bridge the gap in the continuum between care provided in the jails and inpatient hospitalization, with admission to and discharge from the OTxHU in accordance with a patient’s clinical needs. CHS will be the primary health care providers on these units and the NYC Department of Correction will provide security and custody management.


The OTxHU at NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue in Manhattan will be the first of this unique, groundbreaking project to open with a planned completion date as early as the end of 2024. This is an incredible opportunity to be part of a passionate and motivated team providing care to some of the City’s most marginalized, vulnerable people.

* To help support continuity of operations and care, staff selected to work in the OTxHU may also be required to work in CHS locations within the jails. Additionally, while CHS seeks the most qualified individuals for these positions, preference will be given to equally qualified, internal candidates.

SPEAR recently received Columbia University’s Award for Leadership in Clinical Education, given to the top 1/10th of 1% of practices. SPEAR was named six times to the Inc5000 list of fastest growing private companies in America, as well as having been named by SmartCEO magazine as a Future500 company five times.

In 2020, at the peak of the pandemic, the SPEAR Physical Therapy team dedicated themselves to the New York City community. This dedication was a testament to the unrelenting commitment that SPEAR providers have for their patients—the resilience the team demonstrated, and the innovative care provided to our patients–during the events of 2020 are what led SPEAR to be awarded “The Nation’s Top Practice” by the WebPT Ascend Conference. To be recognized during this historically difficult year was a proud moment for the organization and all our incredibly devoted team members.
  
  

In the years to come, SPEAR will continue its path of growth, with further expansion planned beyond the New York City Metropolitan region.

**Posting Summary**
Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, is seeking a Postdoctoral Associate for the department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.  

  

The Mickolajczyk laboratory (**https://sites.rutgers.edu/mickolajczyk-lab/**) is recruiting Post Doctoral Associates to engage in ongoing research projects relative to studying the mechanisms of pre-ribosome maturation by motor proteins and regulation and substrate-targeting by ATPase enzymes in ribosome biogenesis.  

  

The main project involves studying the mechanisms of pre-ribosome maturation by motor proteins, an essential process for generating new ribosomes that are properly folded and competent for protein translation. Force spectroscopy (optical and magnetic tweezers), single-molecule fluorescence, and bulk biochemical methods will be used to investigate how these motor proteins convert the energy from ATP hydrolysis into mechanical work in order to promote pre-ribosomal folding. The assays developed will be used to benchmark wildtype versus disease-derived mutants of motor proteins to investigate the molecular bases of ribosomopathies and other ribosome-dependent diseases. The Post Doctoral Associate will also have the opportunity to participate in ongoing collaborative projects, as well as to spearhead new projects within the lab.  

  

Among the key duties of this position are the following:* Engage in scientific communication, training of junior personnel, grant writing and manuscript preparation.
* Participate in the evaluation of existing procedures, suggesting revisions where necessary and proposing new procedures where required. Assists in the implementation of the programs and projects in special areas of interest to the laboratory.
* Contribute to the development of performance standards, selection of methodology and instrumentation and coordination of the analytical, biochemical, physiology and instrumentation functions with the research areas to ensure conformance with the goals and objectives of the department.
* Maintain accurate records of laboratory notebooks and research activity. Review literature and prepare manuscripts and abstracts for submission. Present findings at national meetings.

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/U--haul","http://www.uhaul.com/","2727 North Central Avenue
