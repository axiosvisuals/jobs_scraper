 **Associate Teacher Job Summary:**


An associate teacher, also known as an assistant teacher or teaching assistant, plays a vital role in supporting the lead teacher and facilitating effective learning in the classroom. The roles and responsibilities of an associate teacher may vary depending on the educational level and specific school policies, but here are some common tasks associated with this position:

 **Essential functions of the Associate Teacher job may include but are not limited to the following:**

  

* **Classroom Support:** An associate teacher assists the lead teacher in various classroom activities, such as preparing instructional materials, creating and printing homework, setting up equipment, and organizing the physical learning environment.
* **Student Supervision:** They help maintain classroom discipline and ensure the safety and well-being of students. This includes monitoring student behavior, managing conflicts, and addressing any immediate concerns that may arise.
* **Instructional Assistance:** Associate teachers support instructional delivery by working with small groups of students or individual students who may require additional attention or assistance while the lead teacher leads the whole group. They may reinforce concepts, provide clarification, or guide students through specific learning tasks based on data collected. Associate teachers also collect data while the lead teacher is teaching.
* **Grading and Assessment:** They may assist in grading student assignments, tests, and exams. This could involve scoring objective assessments, recording grades, and providing feedback based on data as well as under the guidance of the lead teacher.
* **Individualized Education Programs (IEPs):** In inclusive classrooms or special education settings, associate teachers may support students with individualized education plans. They collaborate with the lead teacher and other professionals to implement accommodations, modifications, or specific strategies to meet the students' unique learning needs.
* **Record Keeping and Documentation:** Associate teachers may be responsible for maintaining records, attendance, and other administrative tasks. This could involve accurately documenting student progress, behavior incidents, or any other relevant information as required by the school or district authorizer.
* **Communication and Collaboration:** They assist in fostering effective communication between the lead teacher, students, parents, and other staff members. This includes attending team meetings, parent-teacher conferences, and participating in collaborative planning discussions.
* **Professional Development:** Associate teachers often engage in ongoing professional development activities to enhance their teaching skills and knowledge. They may attend workshops, training sessions, or pursue additional qualifications to support their role in the classroom.
* **Substitute Teaching:** In some cases, an associate teacher is required to assume the lead teacher's responsibilities during their absence. This may be the case for the lead teacher in their classroom or another lead teacher in the grade level team. This involves implementing lesson plans, managing the classroom, and providing instructional support to ensure continuity in the learning process.

  

It's important to note that the specific roles and responsibilities of an associate teacher can vary depending on the educational context, grade level, and the needs of the students and school. The lead teacher and school administration will provide guidance and instructions to ensure effective collaboration and support within the educational setting.

Important Information
FINRA’s Code of Conduct imposes restrictions on employees’ investments and requires financial disclosures that are uniquely related to our role as a securities regulator. FINRA employees are required to disclose to FINRA all brokerage accounts that they maintain, and those in which they control trading or have a financial interest (including any trust account of which they are a trustee or beneficiary and all accounts of a spouse, domestic partner or minor child who lives with the employee) and to authorize their broker-dealers to provide FINRA with duplicate statements for all of those accounts. All of those accounts are subject to the Code’s investment and securities account restrictions, and new employees must comply with those investment restrictions—including disposing of any security issued by a company on FINRA’s Prohibited Company List or obtaining a written waiver from their Executive Vice President—by the date they begin employment with FINRA. Employees may only maintain securities accounts that must be disclosed to FINRA at one or more securities firms that provide an electronic feed (e-feed) of data to FINRA, and must move securities accounts from other securities firms to a firm that provides an e-feed within three months of beginning employment.  

As standard practice, employees must also execute FINRA’s Employee Confidentiality and Invention Assignment Agreement without qualification or modification and comply with the company’s policy on nepotism.
Search Firm Representatives
Please be advised that FINRA is not seeking assistance or accepting unsolicited resumes from search firms for this employment opportunity. Regardless of past practice, a valid written agreement and task order must be in place before any resumes are submitted to FINRA. All resumes submitted by search firms to any employee at FINRA without a valid written agreement and task order in place will be deemed the sole property of FINRA and no fee will be paid in the event that person is hired by FINRA.*FINRA is an Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action Employer*

**Who We Are**


Madwell is a Brooklyn-based creative collective built to disrupt the traditional agency model. Why? Because we believe successful marketing can be anything. And we love that.

**Duration:** 6+ Months ( Possible Contract to Hire)

**Location:** Princeton-NJ, Wilmington-Delaware, Manhattan-NY & San Francisco-CA (**Has to work on EST hours)Webex Dedicated Instance experience is Must**

* The Senior Unified Communications Engineer’s primary role will be providing architectural and infrastructure support to the telecommunications infrastructure team.

* The engineer will be part of client’s engineering team that owns the design, development, delivery, and experience of Unified Communications System platforms.
* The position is responsible for the design, selection, implementation, integration, management, user experience and retirement of Collaboration and Communication technology.
* The position works closely with client’s other IT teams and business partners to deliver consistently excellent user and technology experiences for our staff members and community.

**Additional details**

* **Activity wise =** engineering team - engineering first, escalations second
* **Project work primary**- call manager, cube router, anything on their tech list.
* 20% escalations on a bad week- tier 3 / 4 escalation/expertise, with ops or cisco TAC, etc
* **Troubleshooting skills are key**- both sides- do I know how to approach a problem, how to address it, manage vendor, push forward, get feedback in a timely manner, logs to ticket, following up with TAC, etc.
* Cisco Webex escalation less than stellar. Push cisco- need to be okay put
* **Technology standpoint**- **call manager is key**, cisco ios key, the expressway is VERY nice to have, networking skills/conceptual networking skills, if they have done call manager longer than **3-5 years of implementation** work they would have some general knowledge.
* Any other cisco apps are great. Would love to find someone who has already one a Cicso call manager to Webex calling dedicated instance (call manager in ciscos cloud) calling solution? The DI piece is the same, **Webex calling and Webex calling dedicated instance are NOT the same thing.** Did you set up dedicated instance or Webex calling. They might not know the difference between these until you clarify is it call manager in the cloud. That is in POC right now and they are moving into production late next year.
* **Experience:** used to have 10 years of experience. 8-10 years of experience as long as they have the product experience. Need install, architecture, operations, etc.
* Came out of cisco partner space. Great training ground for someone- you have to do it all. Install, operation, hand off, if they have partner space that is a bonus to Ron. If they are purely ops from there to now- not the right person. Must have Architecture and engineering experience,.
