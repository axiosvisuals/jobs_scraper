WCHS’s powerful educational program enables every student to graduate well-prepared for college and the world beyond it. Most importantly, all WCHS students mature intellectually, socially, and morally as a result of being an active member of a school community that endorses high expectations that challenge each student to achieve his/her full potential.

In order to fulfill its mission, WCHS is looking for exceptional teachers. Our teachers play very critical roles in realizing the core mission, philosophy, and unique youth-centered approach to the school’s educational design. WCHS teachers are not just classroom teachers, but school teachers—educators that are committed to facilitating the entire learning and instructional process and coaching young people to become independent learners, thinkers, and researchers.

**Prospective Williamsburg Charter High School Teachers:**

* Are committed to the idea that every child can succeed at high levels
* Believe that they have been called to teach and empower young people
* Demonstrate a commitment to providing students with a rigorous academic experience
* Are resilient, resourceful, relentless, and well-able to adapt to the many changes that can happen in an organization focused solely on doing what is best for students
* Excel at working in a highly collaborative, professional setting but can also work independently
* Understand the unique needs of the community they serve as well as the complex issues that affect urban youth and their families
* Are committed to inquiry-based teaching
* Engage a youth development approach in their interactions with young people by being sensitive to their developmental needs
* Are passionate and positive about school culture
* Feel full responsibility for students’ achievement
* Love ‘the details’ and realize that student success depends almost exclusively on them
* Are reflective and willing to improve upon their practice through professional development and support
* Effectively manage their time, resources, and technology
* Are convinced of the transformative power of education for all students, families, and educators

**Position Description**

The ideal Williamsburg Charter High School teacher will provide our students with rigorous instruction. They will be responsible for the following:

Teacher as Advisor

As students transition to high school, one of the things they could lose is the comfort of having a teacher who understands their background, challenges, and successes. Research has shown that this relationship is a key part of having students feel accounted for and by extension, accountable. In support of our students, our teachers are also Advisors to between 12-15 students for the duration of their high school career. This allows the teacher to become a part of the developmental process of their students and allows each family to have a primary contact within the school at all times. Advisors serve students and families by:

* Taking complete ownership of the academic, behavioral, and overall success of a group of 12-15 students
* Ensuring advisees are in attendance, punctual, excelling in all their classes, and seeking out appropriate support
* Creating an advisory period that acts as ‘home base’ for each student
* Being the academic expert on each advisee
* Acting as the liaise between the student, the family, and the school teams
* Teaching the advisory curriculum that has been created for their advisees’ grade
* Accompanying advisees on educational field trips as determined by the School Leader
* Contacting their advisee’s families a minimum of seven times a year and responding within 24 hours to all communications from their advisee’s families
* Developing and overseeing Individual Student Support Plan plans twice a year for each of their advisees
* Facilitating discipline-related required meetings on behalf of their advisees
* Performing any other advisor-related duties as requested

Ensuring Student Learning Through Data-driven Instruction:

* Prepare rigorous, student-centered lesson plans that will engage and motivate students to learn
* Plan standards-based units of study with clear, intended outcomes and goals in mind
* Provide meaningful feedback on student work to determine student progress and to make suggestions for improvement
* Proactively and relentlessly seek new ways to promote student learning
* Create thoughtful, standards-based assessments
* Work closely with school leaders and colleagues, using data to drive instruction and by extension, consistently raising student achievement and intervening with improvement plans and support for struggling students
* Have fun and pass the love of learning onto students!
* Design opportunities for students to use the world around them as a classroom through field trips and or/inviting guests into the classroom as appropriate
* Hold students to high behavioral and academic expectations and support students to succeed
* Model professional and collegial behavior for students
* Engage in the process of collaborative evaluation with school leaders
* Ensure that students are well-prepared for all New York State exams and WCHS interim assessments

Personal Commitment to On-Going Learning

* Participate in all assemblies, meetings, school-sponsored events, and professional development activities offered during or after work hours
* Participate in focus groups, evaluations, and committees as requested to assist with the constant improvement of the school as a whole
* Participate and support WCHS open-door classroom policy, allowing parents and teachers and other stakeholders to informally observe your work and actively seeking to observe the work of your colleagues for professional development

Positively Contributing to Student and Teacher Culture

* Arrive at school no later than 7:55 AM (to ensure that the classroom is clean, supplies are prepared and the instructor is ready to receive students) and leave no earlier than 3:10 PM (to hold necessary interventions, hold office hours, attend school meetings, and to ensure that students that need extra help are able to receive it). Even with these times parameters in mind, we ultimately seek educators that will simply do whatever it takes and will work relentlessly to ensure each student’s learning is maximized
* Teach four class periods per school day
* Serve two periods of School Service per week as determined by his/her supervisor (e.g., Study Hall supervision, cafeteria duty, hallway duty, monitoring of student entry and exit, etc.)
* Cover at least five periods per semester for absent teachers
* Proactively involve the student’s family in their learning through regular communications including (but not limited to): weekly informal communication via emails, notes, telephone calls, and meetings
* Realize that although student achievement is central to our work, Williamsburg Charter High School graduates are not just academically well-prepared, but also good citizens of their community. The cornerstone of our ideology is based on providing students with life skills and a sense of responsibility to their community in addition to an excellent education

We believe it should be easy for pet parents to do the right thing. At Pawlicy Advisor, personalized advice from the most trustworthy experts ensures pets get the best care possible.


Pawlicy Advisor is a fast-growing, venture-backed startup focused on helping pet owners around the country find the right health products for their pets, starting with pet health insurance. Pet insurance’s popularity is growing rapidly as pet owners seek protection from the high cost of veterinary care. Our pet insurance marketplace takes into account a pet’s breed-specific health risks to help people find the right policy for their pet. We also save pet owners money by analyzing pricing differences and premium increases over the lifetime of an animal.


We market to pet parents through a number of channels, but the partners we value the most are veterinarians. Vets love pet insurance because it increases that chance a pet parent will be able to afford the cost of treatment, but vets don’t know what providers to recommend and don’t want the liability associated with recommending a specific brand. Pawlicy Advisor helps thousands of vet offices across the US by simplifying the treatment financing conversation.

* *Although we are currently a remote company, we intend to establish permanent offices in San Francisco and NYC following our next major round of funding. This position is strategically placed in New York City close in proximity to our current team and leadership with the expectation of working from an office in NYC two days per week.*

*>>> New York City Area location is a job requirement <<<*

**Where is the Pawlicy Advisor team located?**


Pawlicy is headquartered in NYC and currently the majority of the team operates remotely with a few focused work places around the country. We meet up for company offsites on a regular basis where we fly the whole team out to a fun destination and spend a few days team building. Our last few involved paddle boarding, horse riding, and some early morning yoga. We can’t wait for the next one :)

**How large are you as a business?**


At the time this job post was written, we’re 28. By the end of 2024 we expect to be at approximately 35. Happy to talk more about it in person but below are few stats to get you excited:

* 1000’s of veterinarians are using our product every day to help educate their clients about treatment financing options
* We account for a meaningful percentage of the total new pet insurance selected in the US
* We’ve raised >$19M in venture capital to date

**How does Pawlicy Advisor make money?**


We're a licensed insurance agency so we get paid a commission by the pet insurance company when we help pet parents buy a plan for their pet. These commissions are already priced into the cost of pet health insurance so they’re not paying extra to work with us.

### **Organizational Structure**


This will be our most senior engineering position at Pawlicy Advisor.
