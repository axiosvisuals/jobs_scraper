**Corporate Overview**:  

Truist Securities is the full-service corporate and investment banking arm of Truist Financial Corporation (NYSE: TFC), one of the nation's largest banking organizations. Truist Securities, together with Commercial Real Estate and Treasury Solutions, comprise Truist’s Corporate & Institutional Group, offering lending, capital markets and treasury management solutions to businesses, institutions, not-for-profit organizations and government entities. Founded more than 100 years ago, we offer large-firm capabilities in a boutique culture and value our vibrant workplace that reflects the diversity of the many communities we serve. We pride ourselves on the career development of our teammates. You’ll work alongside senior-level management on real deals right from the start. We encourage and reward you to take an active role in helping our clients achieve their goals.

**Job Description****:**


Truist Securities’ Corporate & Investment Banking Asset Finance Group Analyst Program begins with up to seven weeks of classroom instruction that consists of an introduction to capital markets, products and services, accounting, corporate finance, systems, and financial modeling training designed to give Analysts all the tools they will need to be successful. After the classroom training, Analysts on this team will be placed within one of our five Asset Finance groups (Asset Based Lending, Asset Securitization, Project Finance, Structured Real Estate, Working Capital Solutions) and play a meaningful role in supporting senior investment banking professionals.


Our Asset Finance Group delivers a wide range of financing solutions. We combine market-leading structuring expertise with detailed industry insights and broad distribution capabilities to design a customized strategy that best meets our client’s needs. Analysts will work closely with senior Asset Finance professionals to help drive the growth of the business.


This opportunity will be specifically for the Asset Securitization Group (ASG) group.

**Asset Securitization:**

The Asset Securitization Group provides highly structured debt capital solutions to growing companies across a variety of industries. The transactions ASG executes involve: (1) arranging asset-backed revolving loans for our clients funded directly by Truist and other bank partners; and (2) helping the Bank’s clients issue bonds known as “asset-backed securities” to institutional investors. Analysts in ASG learn the basic principles of structuring these transactions and work directly with senior bankers on each phase of the engagement life cycle including pitching to new clients, closing live deals and managing existing client relationships. These engagements will involve a variety of day-to-day work functions such as using Excel to model cash flows and organize complex data sets into actionable material, compiling information on the asset-backed securities market from Bloomberg and other sources to create client-facing presentations, attending meetings and calls with clients, investors, and other banks, reviewing complex legal documentation to ensure it accurately reflects the terms of each transaction and appropriately protects investors, analyzing company financial statements to project future performance and assess default risk, and producing credit memorandums to present prospective deals to senior members of Truist’s risk organization. The ideal candidate will have a strong working knowledge of MS Office (Excel, PowerPoint, and Word), understand basic principles of financial statement analysis, possess solid written and oral communication skills, and be unflinchingly willing to learn.


The ASG Analyst position is typically a two-year position. At the end of the two-year period, Analysts may be asked to remain in the role for an additional year.

**Location****:**


Truist Securities is headquartered in Atlanta, GA, with offices throughout the U.S. in cities including Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, Orlando, New York, San Francisco, and Washington D.C.


The majority of ASG Analysts will be placed at the Truist Securities headquarters in New York


The starting salary for this position is $100,000.

**Minimum Requirements****:**

* Completed BA/BS degree with a scheduled graduation **December 2024 or May/June 2025**
* Proven analytical ability and attention to detail
* Solid leadership and interpersonal skills
* Superior written and oral communication skills
* Ability to work well in a fast-paced, team oriented environment

**Preferred Requirements****:**

* Business or STEM major
* Overall GPA of 3.0
* Strong interest in finance and investment banking
* Prior completion of Accounting or Finance coursework
* High degree of academic and extracurricular achievement
* Willingness to commit substantial time and energy to the program
