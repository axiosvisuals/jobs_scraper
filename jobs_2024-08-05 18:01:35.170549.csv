In support of the extraordinary care services and luxury living amenities we provide for our residents at The Bristal, we are seeking experienced, dedicated and upbeat **Lifeguards** to maintain a safe recreational and therapeutic environment for our residents in the outdoor pool.

In 1916, skillful master perfumers created a new fresh, refined and modern fragrance in a small perfumer’s laboratory in the old town center of Parma. Named Colonia, this first Italian eau de cologne expressed a new sensibility. What was most striking about it was its formula, produced exclusively with natural ingredients, and its bottle showcasing Art Deco lines. Its popularity reached its pinnacle in the 1950s during the golden age of Italian cinema, when the biggest names in the industry discovered the fragrance while in Rome for film shoots at the famous Cinecittà studios.


Going beyond the Italian border and transcending time and fashion, Colonia became the exclusive perfume of high society, an unmistakable symbol of Italian elegance.


The brand, which opened its first boutique in Milan in 1998, has since developed a wide range of products, including fragrances, colognes, beauty and shaving products, a home collection and leather accessories.

**ABOUT HACK.DIVERSITY**


Hack.Diversity is transforming the economy by breaking down barriers and building access for the next generation in tech. We recruit and place early-career professionals from marginalized backgrounds into software engineering, data analysis, and mechanical engineering roles at major companies, and work with those companies to build inclusive and equitable working environments. Founded in 2016 as a project of the New England Venture Capital Association, “Hack” has grown into an independent nonprofit organization and a movement of belonging in the tech workplace. As of 2022, we have connected almost 400 Fellows into jobs at more than 50 employers to date. At Hack, we believe in a world where success is not limited by access, and where the jobs of today and tomorrow create opportunity for ALL.

**ABOUT YOU**


You are a people-oriented, detail-focused, and passionate team player who genuinely enjoys nurturing partner relationships. You are resilient and have a growth mindset. If you experience one “yes” for every three “no’s,” you see that as valuable progress and become even more empowered to convert the “no’s.” You lead with inquiry, approach challenges with curiosity, seek to understand the perspective that differs from your own, and you see mistakes as an opportunity for growth and learning vs. failure. You would describe yourself as having a “can-do” attitude, and you recognize the importance of mutual feedback for growth. You believe that racial equity, diversity and inclusion are essential to success, and are motivated by what you see as a personal ability to drive meaningful systems change despite potential resistance. You recognize and prioritize self-care as a crucial mechanism to enable your continued efforts towards important, life-changing, and mission-driven work.

**ABOUT THE ROLE**


 Reporting to the Associate Director of NYC, the Partner Success Manager stewards a portfolio of 5-10 Host Company accounts with a minimum annual revenue of $250K.
