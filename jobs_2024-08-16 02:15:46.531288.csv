Park Lane New York, situated on Billionaires’ Row – home to the world’s most coveted addresses on  

Central Park South – has been completely reimagined as a departure from its neighbors and serves as a

Carnegie Hall, 5th Avenue shopping, and the Museum of Modern Art. The 47-story property features 610  

rooms – nearly half of which provide sweeping park-facing views – and 11,000 square feet of reimagined  

indoor and outdoor event space. A fitness center perched on the fifth floor offers state-of-the-art  

equipment and its own separate outdoor terrace. The reimagined hotel features three new food & beverage venues throughout the hotel including an 80-seat lobby bar with an outdoor promenade, an intimate restaurant on the hotel’s second floor, and CentralPark South’s only rooftop lounge atop the hotel.

**About Us:**



Competitive triathletes and passionate bakers, Pam Weekes and Connie McDonald left their careers to open a small bread shop in New York City in 1995 — Levain Bakery.  

One day, they baked a BIG chocolate chip walnut cookie as energy for triathlon training. At Levain, a batch of these 6-ounce cookies flew off the shelves, and an icon was born. The cozy shop on West 74th Street became a neighborhood favorite and a destination for epicurious visitors from around the world, hungry for “the cookie.”  


From the start, Pam, Connie and team baked everything fresh on-site each day, donating the day’s leftovers to charity — and we still do, nearly 30 years later. Today, Levain has bakeries across the country (with more to come!), plus ecommerce gift boxes to treat cookie lovers in every state.  


Every day, we strive to embody our company’s five core values:
* Welcome All- *we are all in it together*
* Work Hard and Be Nice- *we go above and beyond*
* Lead with Heart- *we do the right thing*
* Rise Up- *we are proactive*
* Savor It- *we are present and find the fun!*","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Levain-Bakery","http://www.levainbakery.com","New York","2 to 10","less than $1M (USD)","","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/1497c6aa21dc80b7a30bd7185f92e8ca","","",""

You have options when it comes to finding a new career. When you put on a Mosquito Joe uniform, you become part of the family—a group of people committed to excellent customer service and passionate about making the outdoors a place that’s fun for everyone.

  

No experience is needed. We will train you and help get you licensed so you can have a distinguished career as a pest control technician.

  

This job is college student friendly!

  

The duration of a mosquito season varies by location. This allows you to maximize your work/life balance and spend time on other passions.

  

We are not a standard, run-of-the-mill pest control company. We have it so much better. We only treat outdoor pests like mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas – no crawl spaces, no attics, and no scary sheds to deal with.

  

Instead, you get to work outside, drive a sweet company ride, and get a quick workout. You will make some bugs take a long nap and leave the customer to make fun memories outside again!

  

This truly is one of the best mosquito control jobs on the planet and if you are ready to work outdoors while traveling locally, and love helping people, apply today! You could be the next neighborhood hero!

 **Your Mission if You Choose to Accept It - Responsibilities as a Mosquito Control Technician…**

* **Conquering Mosquitoes –** Yep, you are there to wage war on mosquitoes and other pesky insects that can ruin outdoor fun. Our customers depend on you to remove and repel these enemies from their yards and property.
* **Doing It with Style –** As the face of the Mosquito Joe brand, you bring professionalism by following our Mosquito Joe process. In addition, you go above and beyond to deliver an unforgettable customer service experience.
* **Communicating with the Local Office–** You are the boots on the ground but will be in close communication with the office. This is key for making sure you have the right supplies to do the job and ensuring you know which property to treat!

 **This Mosquito Control Job is For You If…**

* You love being outside.
* You would rather be physically active than stuck behind a desk.
* You enjoy variety. Every property is different, with different problems to solve.
* You value working independently and are ready to use your excellent communication skills when you have the opportunity. (You might work solo or with a partner. You might meet the homeowner, or you might not.)
* You enjoy seasonal work. This is the type of job where you work hard for a few months of the year and can do something else the rest of the time.

 **To Succeed in this Role as a Mosquito Control Technician…**

* **Always bring your A-game.** Remember, you are always on a public stage. You might think no one is home or watching, but you might impress someone with your pest control professionalism!
* **Take the training seriously.** You will learn the proper guidelines for using the products, and we will even help you get licensed where required.
* **Stay on schedule.** We will give you the schedule and timing for the day (usually around 15 appointments).
* **Do it right the first time.** You do not want the customer to call you back out to do it over.
* **Leave the whining at home.** Some days the work will be hard. It will be hot. You will not want to work. Then your work ethic will kick in, and you will show up with a smile.
* **Think observantly and creatively when assessing each unique property.** Every property is different, with different problems to solve.

 **Job Requirements…**


There are a few minimum requirements for our Mosquito Control Technician:

* You must be able to lift and carry a backpack, which weighs 65 lbs. (This will be your strength training workout.)
* You must be able to walk with a 65 lb. backpack for a lengthy period of time. (This will be your cardio workout. You can cancel your gym membership)
* You must wear protective gear and a uniform. (You will be protecting yourself while looking good in uniform)
* You must be able to handle the summer heat. (It is like being paid to go to the sauna.)
* And finally, you must not have moral qualms about being a pest assassin.

 **Benefits & Pay…**

Naturally outgoing, detail-oriented, and unapologetically persistent are just a few of the words we'd use to describe the ideal ***System Integrity Specialist.***The people that do best in this position are often the people called out for being able to start a conversation with just about anyone but known to never take no for an answer. If this sounds like you, then there may be an opportunity for you at **Encore Fire Protection!**  

Encore is an industry leading, full service fire protection company serving all of Northeast from offices in Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, New York, and New Jersey. At Encore, we believe that the key to success is our diverse and talented team of employees. *As part of Encore's mission to be the best fire protection company the industry has ever seen, we have recently joined forces with Checkmate Security Systems Inc., based out of Babylon, NY. This partnership not only allows us to expand our footprint and find top talent in the New York area, it also allows us to work with industry leaders who strive for same level of excellence as we do*.  

The next person we add to our team has to be a proven team-player that can equally work on your own. They have the confidence in details and small intricacies but the ability to also see the bigger picture. They are extremely organized and have notable time management skills to make them thrive in a fast-paced environment with tight deadlines.

  

This is not your typical inside sales role. You will be paired with an outside sales executive. And you will be expected to spend time in the office working with internal resources to accurately quote, develop proposals, and communicate with customers (on the phone and over email), but the similarities end there.

 **Here's what you can expect:**  

* Work with customers to build long standing relationships
* Collaborate with other departments, such as Operations, to ensure that the customer is getting our unique experience
* Be the customers advocate and point of contact for questions and things they need including pointing them in the right direction of who can assist for any requests
* Review past inspection reports to accurately determine system deficiencies and work with customers to quote and service the system
* Perform administrative duties such as writing and send contract renewals, filling out proposals and forms, etc.

**That will account for about 70% of your time.** The rest of the time you will be encouraged to get out of the office to meet customers face to face, build rapport, and survey life safety equipment so that you can effectively quote and sell contracts.  

Salary range: $60,000 - $75,000 base salary plus commission plan, commensurate with experience

 **Requirements:**  

While having the technical experience in fire alarm and/or sprinkler systems is a must, here are a few other requirements to be wildly successful in this role:* You must have some formal sales experience that extends beyond retail or hospitality. Experience selling a service (as opposed to a tangible product) is a plus.
* We are prepared to teach you about alarm and sprinkler systems but you must be ready to commit to learning. This can be a hard pill to swallow for the naturally competitive person who is driven to want to produce out of the gates, we know that, and so we want to be upfront about it.
* You must be good on the computer. To us, ""good"" means that are proficient with the Microsoft Suite (Outlook, Word, and excel) without question. In addition, we use Hubspot and an industry specific program called ServiceTrade. Prior working experience with these programs is not a requirement, but you must be prepared to adopt and self-teach on each of these platforms.
* You must be a people person! You have to build great relationships with your customers and be their advocate as well as a voice of reason.

 **Benefits:**  

As a company, Encore is hyper-focused on developing a culture that thrives on success and is energized by the fact that we get to make peoples' lives better and safer each day. One of the ways we do this is by generously rewarding all those who contribute to our continued growth. But we also believe that not all rewards are monetary. Here are just a few a few perks that a successful individual in this role can expect:* Full-time position with an attractive salary and a results-driven commission plan
* We dress for the objective which means most days we wear jeans but occasionally we wear suits. As long as you know which situations require which (or aren't afraid to ask), you'll be all set!
* Speaking of attire, we offer all employees Encore gear twice a year
* Snacks and coffee everyday and weekly ""to-order"" office lunches and breakfast
* Freedom to express ideas - a culture of willingness to test, try, modify, adopt, enhance, improve and *CHANGE* as needed
* Access to leading edge web-based productivity tools
* Participation in Fidelity 401(K) that includes employer match
* Medical, Dental, and Vision benefits through Blue Cross
* Company-paid life insurance policy of $50,000

In this role, you’ll help ideate and produce engaging content with broad appeal that we distribute to both content platforms and our local publishing network. You'll brainstorm fresh story ideas each week, write and edit new stories, update existing pieces, and work closely with our content strategy leads to fill out and refresh our content library.


We’re looking for candidates with excellent news judgment and storytelling skills who are seasoned editors, adept at identifying new angles with the potential to drive page views and spotting opportunities to repurpose existing content with new pegs. Because many of our stories are built around data rankings and analysis, we’re looking for candidates with experience editing and/or creating these stories (or a willingness to learn, if not).

### **About the company and the team**


Stacker is a new media company excited by the future of journalism. Every day, our efforts center on developing new and more sustainable ways to produce, distribute, and fund great storytelling that contextualizes our world and drives impact for news publishers big and small. We do this through a number of ways—from our tech-forward storytelling method and freely accessible newswire, to offering a structured avenue for non-publisher organizations to participate and contribute to quality journalism.


The syndication desk is a key arm of our newsroom and business model overall. The team focuses on growing audiences across third-party platforms with content that is highly engaging, stokes nostalgia, encourages conversation, and is often informed by data, from movie rankings using Metacritic scores to determining the most popular fast-food restaurants based on data from the American Customer Satisfaction Index. We also produce deeply researched lists on topics ranging from one-hit wonders to the history and origins of slang terms.


As a bootstrapped company, we’re a resourceful team focused on building an inclusive, equitable culture around shared values of integrity, ownership, and collaboration. Building for the future is reflected in the way we work: we are remote-first, embrace flexible schedules, and offer competitive benefits and perks including unlimited vacation, an employee equity program, health & dental coverage, and 401(k) matching.


We’re always looking for curious, media-minded thinkers to join the team. We encourage women, people of color, veterans, people with disabilities, and gender-nonconforming candidates to apply.

### **Responsibilities**

* Tackle first edits on stories, including fact-checking. Ensure every story is accurate, grammatically sound, complete and fair, as well as clear and engaging. (All stories also go through our copy desk, but this is the more substantive first round of edits.)

* Develop skills to produce data-based rankings from a range of sources.

* Assign stories to freelancers and consistently provide feedback to them.
* Manage elements of the editorial calendar, including assigning and overseeing deadlines.

* Help recruit and maintain a diverse network of freelance contributors.

**Requirements**


Must haves:

* 3+ years of professional editing experience, including a strong record of working with writers (in-house and freelance) on story scope, deadlines, and content strategy.
