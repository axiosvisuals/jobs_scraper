We are a team of systems engineers and community builders who are on a mission to help crypto eat the world. After recently raising $225M in series A funding led by Paradigm, we are growing our team.


### **The Role**



The Ecosystem team accelerates the growth of the Monad ecosystem by supporting committed teams that are building ambitious products on Monad.



As an Ecosystem Associate, you'll conceptualize, implement, and manage growth initiatives for early- to mid-stage builders across all verticals (DeFi, gaming, NFTs, etc) to become thriving ecosystem projects. You will use both creativity and data-driven evidence to identify which strategies and support verticals to prioritize. You will manage, maintain, and improve internal and externally-facing systems and processes. You are ready and willing to tackle any challenge, no problem too small. You are someone who is self-sufficient, organized, and ambitious with existing experience in L1/L2 ecosystem development.



This role is crucial to Monad's success, and offers a unique opportunity to impart massive impact on the trajectory of the Monad ecosystem.


### **Who you are**


* Two or more years of experience in ecosystem growth at an L1/L2 blockchain or similar (e.g. portfolio support at a venture firm), onboarding and growing successful projects from the ground up
* You are biased toward action while respecting team-oriented priorities
* You are no-ego, adaptable, entrepreneurial, detail-oriented
* You are an excellent speaker and writer
* You are personable and able to manage expectations across many stakeholders and multiple on-going relationships

### **Bonuses**


* Experience working at an early-stage startup
* Strong existing relationships in the industry
* Fluency in multiple languages

### **What you'll be doing**


* You'll develop and execute new initiatives that grow the Monad ecosystem
* You'll work alongside Business Development, DevRel, Marketing, and Operations teams to execute on initiatives
* You'll collaborate with a range of counterparties, builders, investors, exchanges, infrastructure providers—to promote the growth of the Monad ecosystem
* You'll manage initiatives like grants programs and hackathons that bring builders to Monad and encourage them to compose with other Monad ecosystem apps

### **Why work with us**


* **Huge opportunity.** EVM is ubiquitous but existing EVM-compatible chains are very slow. Monad's core innovations offer developers the best of both worlds (portability and performance) and are a game-changer for mass user adoption in crypto.
* **The right team.** Pushing the performance limits of blockchain requires unique low-latency engineering talent. Our team has nearly ten years of experience staying at the top of brutally efficient high-frequency trading markets. We're assembling a similarly world-class team in BD, Growth, DevRel, and Marketing. Check out our team here.
* **Culture**. We're a lean team working together to achieve very ambitious goals. We are united in our culture of collaboration, low egos, and high-quality outputs. As an early member of our team, you'll help continue to shape our culture.
* **Impactful work**. Your work will be deeply impactful, making decentralized computation orders of magnitude cheaper and more plentiful, ultimately paving the way for new dapps that improve many people's lives.
* **Compensation**. You'll receive a competitive salary and equity package.
* **Resources and growth.** We're well-capitalized, with backing from leading venture funds like Paradigm, Electric Capital, Greenoaks, Dragonfly, and Coinbase Ventures, and from leaders in the space like Cobie. We keep a lean team, and this is a rare opportunity to join. You'll learn a lot and grow as our company scales.

### **Salary and Benefits**

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/U--haul","http://www.uhaul.com/","2727 North Central Avenue
