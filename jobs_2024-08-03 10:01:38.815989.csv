Naturally outgoing, detail-oriented, and unapologetically persistent are just a few of the words I'd use to describe the ideal ***System Integrity Specialist.***The people that do best in this position are often the people called out for being able to start a conversation with just about anyone but known to never take no for an answer. If this sounds like you, then there may be an opportunity for you at **Encore Fire Protection!**  

Encore is an industry leading, full service fire protection company serving all of Northeast from offices in Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, New York, and New Jersey. At Encore, we believe that the key to success is our diverse and talented team of employees.  

As part of Encore's mission to be the best fire protection company the industry has ever seen, we have joined forces with City Fire Equipment Co. based out of East Hanover, New Jersey. This partnership not only allows us to expand our footprint and find top talent in the NJ area, it also allows us to work with industry leaders who strive for same level of excellence as we do.  

The next person we add to our team has to be a proven team-player that can equally work on your own. They have the confidence in details and small intricacies but the ability to also see the bigger picture. They are extremely organized and have notable time management skills to make them thrive in a fast-paced environment with tight deadlines.

  

This is not your typical inside sales role. You will be paired with an outside sales executive. And you will be expected to spend time in the office working with internal resources to accurately quote, develop proposals, and communicate with customers (on the phone and over email), but the similarities end there.

 **Here's what you can expect:*** Work with customers to build long standing relationships
* Collaborate with other departments, such as Operations, to ensure that the customer is getting our unique experience
* Be the customers advocate and point of contact for questions and things they need including pointing them in the right direction of who can assist for any requests
* Review past inspection reports to accurately determine system deficiencies and work with customers to quote and service the system
* Perform administrative duties such as writing and send contract renewals, filling out proposals and forms, etc.

**That will account for about 70% of your time.** The rest of the time you will be encouraged to get out of the office to meet customers face to face, build rapport, and survey life safety equipment so that you can effectively quote and sell contracts. **Requirements**
While having the technical experience in suppression systems is a must, here are a few other requirements to be wildly successful in this role:* You must have some formal sales experience that extends beyond retail or hospitality. Experience selling a service (as opposed to a tangible product) is a plus.
* We are prepared to teach you about alarm and sprinkler systems but you must be ready to commit to learning. This can be a hard pill to swallow for the naturally competitive person who is driven to want to produce out of the gates, we know that, and so we want to be upfront about it.
* You must be good on the computer. To us, ""good"" means that are proficient with the Microsoft Suite (Outlook, Word, and excel) without question. In addition, we use Hubspot, Zendesk, Slack, and an industry specific program called ServiceTrade. Prior working experience with these programs is not a requirement, but you must be prepared to adopt and self-teach on each of these platforms.
* You must be a people person! You have to build great relationships with your customers and be their advocate as well as a voice of reason.

 **Benefits**
As a company, Encore is hyper-focused on developing a culture that thrives on success and is energized by the fact that we get to make peoples' lives better and safer each day. One of the ways we do this is by generously rewarding all those who contribute to our continued growth. But we also believe that not all rewards are monetary. Here are just a few a few perks that a successful individual in this role can expect:* Full-time position with an attractive salary and a results-driven commission plan
* We dress for the objective which means most days we wear jeans but occasionally we wear suits. As long as you know which situations require which (or aren't afraid to ask), you'll be all set!
* Speaking of attire, we offer all employees Encore gear twice a year
* Snacks and coffee everyday and weekly ""to-order"" office lunches and breakfast
* Freedom to express ideas - a culture of willingness to test, try, modify, adopt, enhance, improve and *CHANGE* as needed
* Access to leading edge web-based productivity tools
* Participation in Fidelity 401(K) that includes employer match
* Medical, Dental, and Vision benefits through Blue Cross
* Company-paid life insurance policy of $50,000
