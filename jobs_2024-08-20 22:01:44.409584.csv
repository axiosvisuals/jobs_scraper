Meals on Wheels insures that older New Yorkers receive nutritionally balanced meals. Six meals are delivered weekly, Monday through Friday; a “weekend” meal is delivered on Friday. Healthy Seniors Select Meals on Wheels is funded by the New York City Department for the Aging and City Meals-on-Wheels. It is operated in collaboration with University Settlement, United Jewish Council of the LES, the Chinese American Planning Council and Encore Community Services.

**Date Posted:**  

 8/20/2024  

**Location:**  

 Stamford, CT  

**Date Available:**  

 2024-2025 School Year **The filling of this position is based upon continued funding in the Board of Education budget.**  

  

**Note: Teachers dually certified in TESOL, Bilingual Education or ESL, with experience in Sheltered Instruction or fluency in a language other than English, will be given preference for all Stamford Public School positions.**  

  

**General Statement:**  

The Connecticut State Board of Education (CSBE) believes that high-quality, comprehensive and effective English as a Second Language (ESL) and bilingual education programs are essential to acquire English language proficiency and academic proficiency for students who are English Learners (ELs). EL teachers work under Section 10-17e(3) of the C.G.S. This statute defines an ESL program as ""a program that uses only English as the instructional language for eligible students and enables such students to achieve English proficiency and academic mastery of subject matter content and higher order skills, including critical thinking, so as to meet appropriate grade promotion and graduation requirements.""  

  

EL teachers are specially trained instructors who teach individuals who are not native speakers of English. In Stamford, an EL teacher may work with students qualifying for bilingual or English as a Second Language (ESL) services. EL teachers work to make the core curriculum comprehensible for ELs while building language proficiency in English. EL teachers work primarily providing direct services, such as ESL instruction, but may provide indirect services, such as consultation with classroom teachers and push-in to mainstream classrooms, to eligible students who have proficiencies ranging from scale of 1-5 on the LAS. The primary role of the EL teacher is to enable eligible students to access academic curriculum and gain linguistic proficiency in English.  

  

Educational programs for ELs are regulated by the Every Student Succeeds Act, Title I and Title III. The EL teacher receives supervision from building administration and technical supervision and assistance from the Coordinator of English Learners (EL).

+ Collaborate to support EL students identified as needing additional support on the EL Monitoring Report
+ Assist in the annual assessment of identified EL students as mandated by State and Federal statutes
+ Communicate with parents/guardians of EL students
+ Assist the Coordinator of EL in maintaining records and reports as requested by local, state or federal agencies
+ Work with building administration to develop reasonable schedules for servicing students

Do you want to join one of the world's fastest growing sports technology companies? Genius Sports is at the epicenter of the global network connecting sports, brands and fans through official live data. Our mission is simple. We champion a more sustainable sports data ecosystem that benefits all parties.

  


We're looking for enthusiastic and ambitious people to join our talented team.



If you see yourself becoming part of a global family building the future of sports entertainment together, then come and grow with us. We put trust in our people to deliver the difference for our clients around the world. It's why many of the world's largest leagues & federations such as the NFL, English Premier League, FIBA and NCAA choose to work with Genius Sports.

  


**Background:**



For many decades, the way fans experience and enjoy sports changed very little. Sports fans would travel to stadiums/arenas to participate in the live experience or carved out a few hours to sit down in their living room (or the local pub) to tune into the game. While the internet and mobile devices have made it easier to consume sports from anywhere, technology has, for many years, limited innovation around new ways to engage with sports.



Today, computers have caught up with our imagination driving shifts in consumer behavior that are redefining the way fans enjoy sports almost overnight. This has paved the way for a new era of intelligent sports, one where fan experiences are more intelligent, interactive, individualized, and immersive than ever before:

  

**Intelligent:** Over the past several decades, data, statistics, data science, and increasingly machine learning/AI have changed the way players train, the way teams get built, and the way tickets/games are priced, and the way fans watch sports.


**Immediate:** When it comes to sports, moments matter. Placing a bet a second too late matters. Watching a highlight after all your friends have told you about it matters. Today's fans expect near-real time information and experiences.


**Immersive**: Sports experiences will become more immersive on the web, on our phones, on our smart TV's, and on smart glasses. It will no longer be enough to be watching the action; fans will want to experience and participate in it from the court, pitch, or field.

  

**Job Description:** Product Manager, Widgets & Websites



As a Product Manager, Fan Engagement - Widgets & Websites, you will support the VP of Product and collaborate with cross-functional teams to enhance and optimize our fan engagement offerings across these two key product areas. Your primary focus will be on managing the development and maintenance of innovative widgets and a platform that allows for the creation of websites for Genius's clients.  

  

This role is based in our recently opened, global center, **New York City** office.

* Stay informed on market trends, competitive products, and industry advancements **to keep our offerings cutting-edge** and relevant.

* Proven track record in managing B2C or B2B2C product roadmaps, including defining, executing, and communicating strategies that drive engagement and retention.
* Track record of internal and customer-facing product roadmaps including definition, execution, and communication/socialization as well as experience developing other key product management artefacts (product briefs, epics, user stories, wireframes, etc.)
* Experience optimizing and evolving current products while envisioning, planning, launching and growing new products into the market
* A proven ability to apply data-driven insights from market trends, customer feedback, and the competitive landscape to make informed product decisions about product priorities, strategy, and direction
* A combination of critical thinking and pragmatic decision making to yield the best short-term as well as long-term product results
* A sense of urgency and ability to act quickly and decisively possessing self-confidence to be assertive when taking a position or making a recommendation
* Excellent verbal and written communication and interpersonal skills, with the ability to influence at all levels of the organization
* Demonstrated success working in a matrixed environment at scale partnering across all functions, business groups, and geographies

**About You**

* **B2B Startup Experience** - You have a proven track record of leading product development in a B2B / B2B2C startup environment, working closely with founders to drive strong execution and expansion through the product.

With the increase in youth directly impacted by the shelter and homelessness crisis in New York City, BCNY is dedicated to increasing equitable access to its free, high quality youth programs that foster brave spaces where boys and young men can connect, have fun and build lifelong friendships with peers and mentor. Part of that mission is our commitment to BCNY’s expansion sites in the Bronx and Brooklyn that engage members within their communities with the same youth-centered ethos the organization is known for. Our dedicated and highly skilled staff and our professional advisory council have made BCNY a leader in youth programming across the field and we invite you join our team as we partner with boys and young men as they journey through their childhoods and our clubhouses.
