The Center for Justice Innovation (formerly the Center for Court Innovation) is a non-profit organization that works with communities and justice systems to advance equity, increase safety, and help individuals and communities thrive. The Center's goal is to identify and resolve as early as possible the challenges that bring people into the criminal and civil legal systems. It does this in a number of ways—by developing and running programs that reduce the need for incarceration and enhance economic opportunity, conducting original research to identify what works, and sharing what we learn from our programming and research with those seeking to transform the justice system around the world.


The Center is an 800-employee, $100 million nonprofit that accomplishes its vision through three pillars of work: creating and scaling operating programs to test new ideas and solve problems, performing original research to determine what works (and what doesn’t), and providing expert assistance and policy guidance to justice reformers around the world.


Operating Programs


The Center’s operating programs, including the award-winning Red Hook Community Justice Center and Midtown Community Court, test new ideas, solve difficult problems, and attempt to achieve systemic change within the justice system. Our projects include community-based violence prevention programs, alternatives to incarceration, reentry initiatives, and court-based initiatives that reduce the use of unnecessary incarceration and promote positive individual and family change. Through this programming, we have produced tangible results like safer streets, reduced incarceration, and improved neighborhood perceptions of justice.


Research


The Center's research teams are staffed with social scientists, data analysts, and lawyers who are academically-trained or have lived experience and who conduct research in the U.S. and globally on diverse criminal-legal system and justice issues. Their work includes evaluating programs and policies; conducting exploratory, community-based studies; and providing research translation and strategic planning for system actors. The Center has published studies on topics including court and jail reform, intimate partner violence, restorative justice, gun violence, reentry, sixth amendment rights, and progressive prosecution.

Our story began in 2011 when a group of office workers at a major logistics company in Chicago had a lunch problem. Nearby options were limited and the team was spending too much time and money traveling to their favorite restaurants. They had an idea: bring Chicago’s local restaurant culture inside the office to sell food. It was an immediate hit. When they discovered people from other companies sneaking into their office, they knew they were on to something.  

  

Fooda pioneered the concept of rotating popup restaurants inside offices. Today, we operate in 45 cities with over 100 million meals served and continue to grow rapidly.

more than 800 preventable deaths every day around the world. For each death, 30 women experience a life-threatening complication or life-long disability. Most global maternal deaths can be prevented by ensuring that everyone has timely access to quality, respectful, and equitable maternity care.  

Motivated by the belief that maternal health is a human right, Every Mother Counts (EMC) works to advance evidence-based strategies to address the global maternal health crisis and improve maternal health outcomes and the experience of care for all. EMC supports community-centered care and workforce development by raising awareness, investing in community-led solutions, and advocating for critical systems change.  

Founded by Christy Turlington Burns in 2010, the organization was born to inform, engage, and mobilize new audiences to take action and raise funds that support maternal health programs around the world. Today, EMC has an $8.6M operating budget and invests in organizations rooted in the communities where they are based as EMC firmly believes that local teams are critical to identify and develop effective, appropriate solutions to improve maternal health. The organization supports community-based partner organizations in underserved and historically marginalized communities that are delivering high-impact, cost effective, person-centered initiatives. Most critical to EMC’s mission is their prioritization of the needs of mothers. The organization strives to ensure that each person is informed of their birthing options, has a voice in their own care, and has access to quality care.  

Since its inception, EMC has invested more than $42M to make pregnancy and childbirth safe, respectful, and equitable for everyone, everywhere through grants and public education that support models of care across 9 countries including the United States, Guatemala, Haiti, Tanzania, and Bangladesh, and awareness raising worldwide. As maternal death rates have been steadily on the rise in the United States, despite spending more money per capita on maternal health than any country in the world, EMC doubled its grantmaking in the U.S. since 2020.  

In addition to investments in community-led models of care, EMC is committed to diversifying the healthcare workforce, and advocating for systems change. Through collaboration with key policymakers, practitioners, and community members, the team identifies priority maternal health issues. EMC’s program and policy efforts are complemented by our compelling storytelling, which is at the core of the organization’s founding. Some of EMC’s most impactful films include:* No Woman, No Cry
* Giving Birth in America series
* Con Madre
