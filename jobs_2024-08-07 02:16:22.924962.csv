The world of work is changing…short commutes, flexibility, and convenience are the minimum standards employees want when it comes to how they want to work!



At IWG, we are leading the way. We’ve built the world’s largest workspace network so that our customers can work from wherever, and however, they want… in over 120 countries across the globe!



Join us and help us bring more freedom to people and businesses, while expanding our network. You’ll be able to enjoy a great work life balance and competitive benefits, while growing your career path along the way.

  


**The opportunity**



As a Community Associate, you’ll work closely with new and existing customers across a myriad of industries, working to create and maintain your own community within your center, where you will help take care of all the administrative and support needs for your customers…so that your customers can focus on running their business.

  


**A typical day at IWG**

You arrive a few minutes before your center opens to make sure everything is ready and check there’s nothing the cleaners have missed.



Customers arrive all throughout the morning. One asks you for a changed WiFi code. Another wants to know if his important package has arrived. A woman needs directions to her meeting room… and can you help her set up the projector and show her where to find a great cup of coffee. You’re off to help her get set-up, as soon as you connect the incoming call to another customer. You may sure that all of the services are properly charged, so that invoices are accurate.



It’s time for a quick coffee break, relax and enjoy a few minutes to yourself.



The mail arrives. You sort through it while dealing with a whole host of other customer requests, remembering to email the customer from earlier to let him know his package is waiting for him in his mailbox. And that’s lunch.



A new wave of customers arrive throughout the afternoon. You help a customer with printing and another with their invoice. A customer in a team room say it’s too hot in their office, no problem you are on it and open a ticket in our service portal.



You’ve earned yourself another quick coffee break, relax and enjoy a few minutes to yourself.



Early afternoon, you sit down with the Community Manager to discuss the organization of next week’s networking event in your center. You plan and write the e-invites to customers, then create, print and put-up posters on the noticeboards around the center. To your excitement, the Community Manager is coming around the corner with a prospect (someone interested in joining the IWG community), you share a few details about what makes this space so amazing for your customers and encourage them to join the network soon so they can participate in next week’s networking event – then you head back to finish putting up your posters.



The day is coming to a close. Time to gently ask the large group in meeting room 3 to start wrapping up. You direct them to the nice restaurant you know around the corner, so they can grab a bite and continue their discussion. You ensure everything’s nice and tidy, it’s time to head home.

  



**About you**



We’re looking for someone who knows how to manage multiple tasks while providing customers with the best possible service. You also need to be:


* A good communicator, with the ability to build strong professional relationships and empathize with people’s needs (Ideally 1+ years of customer service experience)
* Happy taking ownership of problems and finding ways to solve them
* Positive, enthusiastic, and able to adapt to fast-changing situations
* Experience and confidence using MS Office and other basic IT equipment
* Legally eligible to work in the Country you are applying within and at least 18 years old

  



**What we offer**



On top of a competitive total compensation package, you’ll enjoy:


* Work life balance (no standard nights/weekends)
* Generous paid time off plans (sick and vacation)
* 11 Paid Company Holidays per calendar year (in addition to your PTO accrual)
* Competitive 401K Program, with a Company match

Relationships are paramount to life at Method, and we invest heavily in building and maintaining relationships with clients, journalists and each other. We work hard to deliver incredible results for our clients. We encourage new ideas, and we always celebrate wins together – both for clients and our teams.  

Method is made up of an award-winning team. Not only does the agency win awards, our people are consistently recognized for their excellence. We believe that begins with the recognition they get internally. Our leadership invests significant resources into employee mental health, wellbeing, education and development — and we praise outstanding performance regularly.  

Curious about what it’s like in real life? Here’s what some of our former graduate associates, now full-time employees, have said about their experience at Method:  

*“Method provides the best opportunity to grow and learn that I have ever been a part of. I had done internships before where I felt like I was on my own trying to figure things out and never really learned anything. That’s not the case at Method. Method is a fast-paced, challenging environment that will provide you with experiences to help develop your talent. Not to mention you will be working with some of the most talented PR professionals that are happy to help you out. Method will get you on track to a promising career.”* *“Graduate associates play an integral role at Method and help reinforce the foundation of every team they are on. They’re in a unique position to learn from some of the best in the business, as they get to rub shoulders daily with our all-star leadership team and incredible clients. This isn’t a position for college graduates who want to make coffee.”* *“Being a Graduate Associate at Method was the best way I could’ve transitioned from bright-eyed college student to actual PR professional. Co-workers across offices and at different levels were willing to take the time to personally train me and ensure I understood The Method Way. I was assigned real work that goes directly to the client. From the beginning I felt like a vital team member, and that feeling has continued to grow as I’ve been promoted to a full-time employee.”* **About the Company**
