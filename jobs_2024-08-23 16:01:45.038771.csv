**Job Summary**

theCoderSchool is looking for passionate Code Coaches(CS Tutors) to teach our next generation how to change the world! You will meet incredible kids, teach them how to code (and how to think like a coder!), and be rewarded with an amazing experience. This is a part-time position for **6-15 hours/week** (same times weekly), depending on your schedule and availability. These hours can generally be sometime between 3-8 pm weekdays or late morning on weekends.

**Responsibilities**

A Code Coach is a mentor who teaches kids how to code. At theCoderSchool, we have three basic teaching styles - your assignment will depend on schedule, ability, and desire.

* **Private and Semi-Private Tutoring.** One-to-one or one-on-two coding lessons for kids. Younger kids will be taught in Scratch or Snap, while older kids gravitate towards Python/Javascript or other advanced languages like Java, C++, Unity. The kids will generally create apps that you decide with them, and generally follow our curriculum.
* **App Team.** Our more experienced Code Coaches will manage a team of kids who will collaborate doing fun group exercises to improve their presentations skills with an objective to prepare their presentations for our regular Coder Fairs.
* **Code Class.** Traditional curriculum based classes with a larger student to teacher ratio, where all students follow a set specific curriculum.

**This position rocks because you will:**

* Meet, mentor, and grow amazing kids who are ready to be out next generation of coders!
* Meet and communicate with parents - many of whom will be techies themselves, who work at some of the best companies and startups in the New York area.
* Give back to the community and help grow our next generation by sharing your knowledge of technology
* Have the flexibility to teach what you're most comfortable with, and learn new things along the way

Requirements

What do we want from you? Read on.

* ***PASSION***. All caps! This is all about giving back to the kids. We need to see goose bumps when your student ROCKS a code challenge.
* **Great Communicator**. There will be plenty of chatting with parents, and of course patience is a virtue when it comes to kids!
* **Street Cred**. Our college-level Code Coaches will have Comp Sci or Engineering or similar major at a nearby accredited school. Our Veteran Code Coaches will have relevant industry experience.
* **Coding Skills**. Strong grasp of basic procedural programming. General knowledge of other languages is assumed - Javascript, PHP, HTML/CSS, Python, Java are most helpful. Deep technical skills aren't required - we prefer you communicate well and find answers along with students than know everything upfront.
* **Teaching Experience.** Experience teaching kids in any subject is a plus, as is experience with Scratch or Snap.

The Janowitz Laboratory at CSHL is seeking a highly motivated, creative, and interactive postdoctoral researcher with strong experimental and analytical skills to help discover molecular mechanisms that cause the whole-body response to cancer. We employ pre-clinical and clinical research to develop and test new treatment strategies combining body reprogramming and anti-cancer medications and to discover fundamental biological interactions between tumors and host organ systems.

We are looking for candidates interested in developing their own research question in alignment with the interests and skills present in the laboratory and institution. A potential focus could be the intersection of nutrient processing and the neuroendocrine response to cancer as part of a fully funded research program.

The selected candidate will be provided significant resources, including access to state-of-the-art laboratory space and core facilities. The post enables researchers to discuss complex science in a relaxed and diverse atmosphere defined by constructive thought exchange. Opportunities to learn about model systems of disease, advanced microscopy, genetic engineering, new sequencing techniques, bioinformatics, translational science, statistical analyses, communication of science, and funding applications will be provided.

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington).

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/U--haul","http://www.uhaul.com/","2727 North Central Avenue
