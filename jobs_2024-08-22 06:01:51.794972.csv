The Center for Justice Innovation (formerly the Center for Court Innovation) is a non-profit organization that works with communities and justice systems to advance equity, increase safety, and help individuals and communities thrive. The Center's goal is to identify and resolve as early as possible the challenges that bring people into the criminal and civil legal systems. It does this in a number of ways—by developing and running programs that reduce the need for incarceration and enhance economic opportunity, conducting original research to identify what works, and sharing what we learn from our programming and research with those seeking to transform the justice system around the world.


The Center is a 900-employee, $100 million nonprofit that accomplishes its vision through three pillars of work: creating and scaling operating programs to test new ideas and solve problems, performing original research to determine what works (and what doesn’t), and providing expert assistance and policy guidance to justice reformers around the world.

**Operating Programs**


The Center’s operating programs, including the award-winning Red Hook Community Justice Center and Midtown Community Justice Center, test new ideas, solve difficult problems, and attempt to achieve systemic change within the justice system. Our projects include community-based violence prevention programs, alternatives to incarceration, reentry initiatives, and court-based initiatives that reduce the use of unnecessary incarceration and promote positive individual and family change. Through this programming, we have produced tangible results like safer streets, reduced incarceration, and improved neighborhood perceptions of justice.

**Research**


The Center's research teams are staffed with social scientists, data analysts, and lawyers who are academically-trained or have lived experience and who conduct research in the U.S. and globally on diverse criminal-legal system and justice issues. Their work includes evaluating programs and policies; conducting exploratory, community-based studies; and providing research translation and strategic planning for system actors. The Center has published studies on topics including court and jail reform, intimate partner violence, restorative justice, gun violence, reentry, sixth amendment rights, and progressive prosecution. The research teams strive to make their work meaningful and actionable to the communities they work with, policymakers, and practitioners.

**Policy & Expert Assistance**


The Center provides hands-on, planning and implementation assistance to a wide range of jurisdictions in areas of reform such as problem-solving courts (e.g., community courts, treatment courts, domestic violence courts), tribal justice, reducing incarceration and the use of fines/fees and reducing crime and violence. Our current expert assistance takes many forms, including help with analyzing data, strategic planning and consultation, policy guidance, and hosting site visits to its operating programs in the New York City area.

**Center Support**


A dedicated support team within the Center ensures the smooth functioning of operations across various domains, including finance, legal, technology, human resources, fundraising, real estate, and communications. Comprising 15% of the organization's staff, these teams provide essential infrastructure support and innovative solutions aligned with the Center's mission and values.

**THE OPPORTUNITY**


The Center is seeking a dynamic and compassionate professional to join the Center’s People team as an Employee Relations Specialist. The Employee Relations Specialist handles employee complaints, disputes, and performance matters, ensuring fair treatment and compliance with organizational policies and employment laws. The role also works in a preventative manner by providing training to managers and supervisors on topics including performance management and communication techniques, and by serving as a resource to managers and supervisors as well as to the People Department team. This is a role within the Center’s People Department. However, for an interim period, the position will report to the Deputy General Counsel.

* Be a resource to managers and all staff on Employee Relations processes, policies, and best practices and ensure the proper implementation;
* Provide excellent customer service to staff by being proactive and responsive to employee inquiries;
* Develop and lead training and other supports to managers on topics such as giving feedback and communication techniques;
* Visit program site locations to connect with our staff to deepen relations with staff;
* After the role transitions to the People Department, continue to coordinate and consult with the Legal Team on investigations and other employee relations matters, as appropriate;
* After the role transitions to the People Department, assist with other projects as needed;
* Additional tasks as necessary.

**Qualifications:** The ideal candidate will have:

* A Bachelor's degree required;
* A minimum of 5 years as an HR Generalist or related HR experience required, including 3-4 years of experience conducting investigations in response to employee complaints particularly in relation to Equal Employment Opportunity, Anti-Harassment and Discrimination and Violence-Free Workplace policies;
* Excellent interpersonal communications skills, a collaborative approach to problem-solving, exceptional organizational and analytical skills, and the ability to work in a fast-paced environment are required;
* Strong ability to work independently, prioritize work, efficiently complete tasks with multiple simultaneous projects, maintain confidentiality and discretion, and exercise good judgment; and
* Excellent verbal and writing skills.

**Position Type:** Full-Time.

**Position Location:** Hybrid with approximately three days onsite per week at our midtown Manhattan location with occasional travel within the five boroughs to other sites and Newark, New Jersey.

**Compensation:** The compensation range for this position is $75,000 - $90,000 and is commensurate with experience. The Center for Justice Innovation offers an excellent benefits package including comprehensive healthcare with a national network, free basic dental coverage, vision insurance, short-term and long-term disability, life insurance, and flexible spending accounts including commuter FSA. We prioritize mental health care for our staff and offer services like Talkspace and Ginger through our healthcare plans.

A chef will find the same blue aprons and green tape in each of our kitchens—symbols of a common striving for excellence. Outside the kitchens, every action we take must reflect the generosity, nurturing and finesse within. As members of the TKRG family, we have the responsibility to ensure this consistency. Beyond it all is a mission, perhaps summed up best by Chef Keller himself. “To make people happy, one guest at a time,” he says. “That is what cooking is all about.”
