Requirements/Responsibilities
  
Do you have what we're looking for?
  
  

There are really 5 crucial that we look for in our team members. We believe that out of these 5 things, most other qualities or requirements will flow naturally.
  
  

1. Reliable - We are looking for individuals that we can count on. We need to be able to trust that you will arrive punctually to each shift you’ve been assigned, and that you will accomplish the tasks assigned to you.
  
2. Integrity - We want a committed team that we can trust to handle ALL guest interactions with the utmost care. We also understand the importance of teamwork, which means there needs to be a level of trust that is deep and genuine with the attitude of a servant’s heart. You must be trustworthy in all circumstances in order to gain the trust of individuals.
  
3. Hungry - (I’m sorry, but this doesn’t relate to food;) We are looking for individuals who have a passion for growth. Hungry team members take efforts to improve themselves during and outside of work, they have plans for bettering themselves. Hungry team members are always striving to do and accomplish more even when others don’t see anything that needs to be done. In other words, you push hard and strive to be the best you can.
  
4. Humble - Humility is the lynchpin of being on a team. If you can’t admit weaknesses, confess mistakes and ask for help from others, this will be a difficult job for you. Everyone makes mistakes, but it’s how we humble ourselves so others can address us, and how we learn from them that matters.
  
5. Smart - This refers to both being smart intellectually, but more importantly, to emotional intelligence. It means that you are wise in communicating, and understand the impact that your words, attitude or body language can have. It means understanding people and knowing what or what not to say, and when or when not to say it.
  
  

These are some of the main qualities that we are looking for in our team members. As I have said before, teamwork is so important to everything done in the restaurant. If you are not looking for a place that will challenge you to grow, incur great communication, and push you to put others first, you will not enjoy working here. We are heavily invested in character development and striving to bring out the best in each of our team members.
