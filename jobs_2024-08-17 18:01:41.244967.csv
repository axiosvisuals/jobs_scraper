Boundless Adventures is an outdoor aerial adventure park, which is an obstacle course in the trees. Climbers get harnessed up and go on a self-guided adventure, with staff present on the ground for assistance and encouragement. We have nine courses at four levels of difficulty with courses that are between ten and forty feet in the air. The obstacles range from simple bridges to difficult hanging platforms that climbers must jump across. This is a rain or shine facility, closing only for thunderstorms and/or more extreme weather. Our Spring and Fall season are weekend admission only, with the possibility for larger group bookings on the weekdays. We are open full time, seven days a week in the Summer. We open to the public in April and close for the season around Thanksgiving. We use five point harnesses and the CLiC-iT safety system to keep our climbers safe.

The Role

As a park monitor, your role is to ensure the safety and well-being of the guests. This position is not unlike being a lifeguard, with a few key differences. For one, you are just as much a coach as a cop. Many of our guests may have never done something like this before; you need to be on the lookout for people who need help or encouragement, as well as those who are breaking the rules.

Guests are also able to tap out any time, and do not have to continue on a course should they become too tired or afraid. When that happens, your job is to climb up to them and get them down quickly and safely. Additionally, you must be able to speak publicly. Part of the process of getting people up and into the trees is the safety briefing. Before we allow our climbers on to the course, each must attend a safety briefing where a monitor demonstrates how to use the safety equipment and conveys all of the rules to the climbers.

Qualities

Prospective applicants should have the following qualities and/or the desire to improve or acquire these qualities through their work.

● Open-Mindedness

● Comfort in nature

● Comfort at heights

● A reasonable degree of fitness

● Communication skills

● Public speaking skills

● At least ten hours a week they’re willing to work

● A strong work ethic

Climbing and Belay experience is a plus.

This is an entry level position. The company is prepared to teach prospective employees all necessary skills to perform the monitor role.

Compensation

Pay starts at 15 dollars an hour. Training is paid for. Higher levels of proficiency and training earn a higher rate.

Scheduling

We offer flexible scheduling. During the spring and fall, out hours depend on group bookings and school schedules. Prospective staff should be willing to work nights, weekends, and holidays. We offer flexible scheduling, with shifts ranging from 4-9 hours. Prospective staff should be aware that staff with more open availability will most likely receive more hours. Being available for spring, summer and fall is a big plus.

Training and Duties

We have 3 levels of certification for our monitor position. The 1st level, M1, are staff who are trained to harness and brief guests, monitor the main platform and Junior Explorer Courses, and guide guests. The second level, M2, have all the same responsibilities as an M1, but are also trained in rescue techniques, so they can lower guests off the course if the need arises. M3s, our most senior monitors, are asked to help lead, teach, and help maintain the courses. Both our M2 and M3 levels receive compensation commensurate with their duties.

M1 trainings is about 16 hours, M2 training is an additional 16 hours. M3 is awarded based on performance and experience.

We are a team of systems engineers and community builders who are on a mission to help crypto eat the world. After recently raising $225M in series A funding led by Paradigm, we are growing our team.


### **The Role**



Monad Labs is looking for a **Workplace Operations Associate** to assist with all aspects of our in-office operations. You will have cross-departmental responsibilities that require strong communication skills, organization, and collaboration with C-suite, Recruiting, the greater Operations team and more. We are looking for a highly motivated and results-oriented individual who thrives in a start-up environment and can juggle multiple work streams.


### **Who you are**


* Resourceful and self-motivated
* Team oriented, collaborative, and a good communicator
* Adaptive; able to make meaningful contributions in a fast-paced environment
* Proactive, organized and detail oriented
* A natural people-person with ""host-mentality"" - internal and external POC for all aspects of work experience and office needs

### **What you'll be doing**



You will own all aspects of in-office and workplace administration, including cross-departmental initiatives.

In this role, you will oversee day-to-day operations of both existing and new office spaces, including but not limited to:

* **The right team.** Pushing the performance limits of blockchain requires unique low-latency engineering talent. Our team has nearly ten years of experience staying at the top of brutally efficient high-frequency trading markets. We're assembling a similarly world-class team in BD, Growth, DevRel, and Marketing. Check out our team here.
* **Culture**. We're a lean team working together to achieve very ambitious goals. We are united in our culture of collaboration, low egos, and high-quality outputs. As an early member of our team, you'll help continue to shape our culture.
* **Impactful work**. Your work will be deeply impactful, making decentralized computation orders of magnitude cheaper and more plentiful, ultimately paving the way for new dapps that improve many people's lives.
* **Compensation**. You'll receive a competitive salary and equity package.
* **Resources and growth.** We're well-capitalized, with backing from leading venture funds like Paradigm, Electric Capital, Greenoaks, Dragonfly, and Coinbase Ventures, and from leaders in the space like Cobie. We keep a lean team, and this is a rare opportunity to join. You'll learn a lot and grow as our company scales.

### **Salary and Benefits**



Minimum full-time salary of $90,000 - $100,000 (\\*\\*This is not a guarantee of compensation or salary; a final offer amount may vary based on factors including, but not limited to, experience, domain expertise, and geographic location).
