**POSITION DETAILS**


York College, founded in 1966, is a center of academic excellence in the heart of Jamaica, Queens. One of the eleven senior colleges in The City University of New York, the College’s mission is to enrich students' lives by fostering an environment where they’ll grow into passionate and engaged learners.


York’s academic programs are housed in three schools: The School of Arts & Sciences, The School of Business and Information Systems, and The School of Health Sciences and Professional Programs. Over sixty baccalaureate programs from across a variety of disciplines, including accounting, aviation management, business, computer science, journalism, social work, teacher education, a dual BS/MS degree in Occupational Therapy, and one of the top-ranked nursing programs in New York State, provide students with opportunities to study liberal arts, sciences, and professional programs. The College also offers five graduate programs: Aviation Management, Clinical Trials Management, Pharmaceutical Science and Business, Physician Assistant, and Social Work.

Uptown Coffee Bar is a new coffee shop in West Nyack, across from the Palisades Mall. UCB has a fun urban/multicultural vibe and friendly service. We pride ourselves on having a diverse team of friendly, creative, and open-minded people.

Candidates for the barista role should have an outgoing personality and appreciation for urban/multicultural culture. We are also looking for people with an interest in helping the company come up with exciting new menu items and engaging social media content. The ideal candidate would have previous experience working in a fast-paced foodservice environment. Starbucks or Dunkin’ experience is a big plus.

The barista role pays $16/hour + tips. We are currently looking for candidates who are available to work 4 or 5 days late mornings (10:30am) afternoons until close (6:30pm) four to five days per week.

**Job Responsibilities**

· Take customer orders efficiently and accurately

· Efficiently prepare drinks and other menu items (e.g. teas, refreshers, pastries)

· Keep the bar and customer areas organized and well-stocked

· Maintain a clean and safe work environment

· Interact and engage with customers in a friendly and authentic manner

Unlike other coffee shops, UCB will have an entrepreneurial culture in which baristas will have the opportunity to help the management of UCB come up with exciting new menu items, promotions, and social media content

**Qualifications**

* Availability to work 4-5 days per week late mornings until close (10:30am-6:30pm)
* A friendly and outgoing personality
* Ability to work efficiently in a fast-paced environment
* Flexibility to work early mornings, evenings, weekends, and holidays as needed
* Previous experience at an established coffee shop such as Starbucks or Dunkin’ is a big plus
* Ability to speak Spanish is also desirable

**Overview of Uptown Coffee Bar**  
The coffee scene in Rockland County is mediocre at best. Although there are places that sell decent coffee, the customer experience at most local coffee shops is bland and uninspired.

The new Uptown Coffee Bar is the first coffee shop that embodies an urban and multicultural vibe. This comes to life via a stylish decor, sophisticated urban/multicultural playlist, and friendly service from a diverse staff. In addition, UCB will leverage social media to actively engage customers about topics such as music, sports, and streetwear. UCB is about more than coffee... It will be a lifestyle brand that customers will find more fun and relevant than competitors like Dunkin' and Starbucks.

The Uptown Coffee Bar menu will feature coffee drinks, teas, refreshers, pastries, and breakfast sandwiches. The quality of the coffee/food will be a step up from other coffee shops and the selection will include a broader selection of trendy items and multicultural foods/beverage choices.

**What you will do**

As a Capital Equipment Valuation Engineer Intern, you’ll be taking and combining engineering and financial aspects to value and strategically advise on clients’ machinery and equipment assets. In a role where there is no typical day, you’ll need to be able to jump between analytics, modeling, client presentations but also travel out to plants to interview financial managers, production engineers, and CFO’s responsible for their manufacturing operations.

You’ll need to be adaptable and be able to split your time between different roles and responsibilities such as performing on-site manufacturing diligence, interacting with clients and working in a corporate environment. Your work will vary by engagement – one day you could be working on a project to value a chemical plant and the next day you might be helping to analyze the value of telecommunication satellites or preparing client presentations and proposals. On top of this, you’ll need to be comfortable with a hybrid role, encompassing analytical solutions in both engineering and finance.

* A strong academic record, including, without limitation, course work that EY deems relevant to this position (GPA minimum of 3.2).

* **Preferred qualifications**
* A genuine interest in financial strategy and a constantly updating understanding of current trends and issues.
* Strong MS office skills, especially when modeling using Excel.
* Strong analytical and problem-solving skills, supported by the confidence to work effectively in a high-energy, fast-moving environment.
* The ability to influence colleagues and communicate complex concepts simply and effectively to non-technical audiences.
* Exposure to discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation methodology.
* Access to reliable transportation to/from the EY office and client sites.
* A driver’s license is strongly recommended as ride share and public transportation options may not be available in all locations.

In addition, our Total Rewards package includes medical and dental coverage, pension and 401(k) plans, and a wide range of paid time off options.

We work with talent to break the information and process asymmetries holding them back from doing more, making more, and being more. We’ve raised over $15M from world-class investors like Maveron, Resolute Ventures, Bloomberg Beta, Kevin Durant and Rich Kleiman’s Thirty Five Ventures, Palm Tree Crew, and more.

Free Agency brings Hollywood-style career management to knowledge workers, starting with the tech industry. We provide concierge services and digital products to help people find incredible jobs, make more money, and become high-performing leaders. Unlike solutions in recruiting, we’re entirely paid by the talent we work with, which enables us to provide them with dedicated Talent Agents to manage “the business end” of their career. Talent success becomes our success.

To date, we’ve helped hundreds of professionals negotiate over $340 million in offers, and work with talent building the cutting-edge future in the startup and tech industry.

**About the job:**

We are seeking actors and on-screen talent in NYC to be long-term personas for social media accounts. You’ll read scripts (anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 minutes) for (mostly) short form videos.

Content will be related to the tech & startup industry, including topics in career, job search, and AI, so you should be comfortable with complicated topics and understanding the content of your scripts. These will mostly be recorded on phones, though we have professional A/V equipment and will still be taking extra steps when it comes to audio and lighting.

**Requirements:**

* Frequent availability to shoot in-person in NYC, starting as soon as possible
* Must have experience setting up your own shoots (lighting, prosumer mics, etc.)
* Must have a professional demeanor, dress business casual
* Non-union

**Compensation:**

$20-$25 per hour.

**Please ensure your application materials include a headshot and reel.**

**Why Free Agency matters:**

Job search and career progression are broken. Candidates haphazardly apply to jobs, meet only a few companies, settle during offer negotiation, and generally don’t optimize the process of moving along in their careers. As a result, Free Agency believes that everyone is undercompensated.

That doesn’t just have to do with the money we make, but also the teams we’re a part of, the type of work we get to do, and the alignment to mission along the way. All of this has an impact on our own satisfaction, health, and financial wellness, but we don’t give it the attention it deserves.

By aligning incentives with individual talent, Free Agency is enabled to build first-of-their-kind products & services and define a new category of career management.
