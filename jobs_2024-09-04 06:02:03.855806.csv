==========================


Tandem is a generational opportunity to rethink how we bring new therapies to market, and our path to doing so is significantly de-risked – we have:

* **Exponential organic growth:** We have product-market fit and are growing rapidly through word-of-mouth. Tandem supports thousands of patients every week and is doubling physician user count every month. We will reach millions by 2025.
* **An AI-first business model:** Our approach is distinctly enabled by AI, but our business will get stronger (not commoditized) as foundation models improve. We are building durability through two-sided network effects that will compound over time.
* **Top tier investors:** With the traction to support conviction in our model, we raised significant funding from investors (including Thrive Capital, General Catalyst, and Bain Capital Ventures) to build an exceptional team of engineers and operators.

**Our number one problem is scaling to meet demand**. We are looking for individuals who are high horsepower, high throughput, and hyper resourceful to help us increase capacity and grow. We move fast and need to move faster.

*All roles are in person in New York. You can learn more about working with us in the last section of this page.*

**About the role**
==================


As a Data Scientist on our team, you will not only define and predict our company’s core metrics, you will drive them. This is a role of immense range, stretching from developing advanced analytical models to owning end-to-end strategic project implementation. Your work will be hyper cross-functional, sometimes driving forward technical projects in partnership with an engineer, other times leading an operations workstream. You will also engage directly with Fortune 100 customers to understand their needs and present on Tandem’s performance and relevant insights.


This is a demanding role, with a high level of autonomy and responsibility. You will be expected to ""act like an owner"" and commit yourself to Tandem's success. If you are low-ego, hungry to learn, and excited about intense, impactful work that drives both company growth and accelerated career progression, we want to hear from you.

**If you join, you will:**
--------------------------

* Drive strategic projects that require deep data analysis, with accountability for end-to-end execution and business outcomes – this may include:


	+ Sourcing and using industry and market data to shape Tandem’s go-to-market and growth strategy
	+ Leveraging our internal workflow data to predict operational throughput and bottlenecks and prioritize new workflow automations as we scale
	+ Prototyping new modeling approaches to AI problems (e.g., outcome prediction and optimization for insurance-related processes) in collaboration with our Engineering team
	+ Building out a unified user interaction model to define Tandem’s consumer and provider product roadmaps
* Create and rapidly iterate on externally facing data products for Tandem’s key partners and actively participate in priority client engagements
* Establish tandem’s core data sources and metrics to empower everyone on the team to answer complex questions about Tandem’s business in real time
* Work directly with our CEO and leadership team as a critical partner in making business decisions as we balance speed of growth and long-term profitability

**We’re looking for you if you:**
---------------------------------

* Advanced degree in a quantitative field or 2+ years of work experience in an analytics-heavy, business-focused role
* Strong technical background with exceptional ability to do data analysis using SQL and Python, as well as pick up new tools on the fly
* Comfort with zooming in and out of problems, jumping between high-level thinking and granular methods of problem solving
* Strong written and verbal communication that allows you to be an effective participant in both internal debates and external relationships
* Track record of moving quickly, finding shortcuts, and going to unreasonable lengths to deliver on goals
* High NPS with your former teammates


This is a list of ideal qualifications for this position. If you don't meet every single one of them, you should still consider applying! We’re excited to work with people from underrepresented backgrounds, and we encourage people from all backgrounds to apply.

**Working with us**
===================


Tandem is based in New York, with our full team working out of a beautiful and spacious office in SoHo.


We run as a high-trust environment with high autonomy, which requires that everyone is fully competent and operates in line with our principles:

* **Commit to audacity.** ""Whether you think you can, or you think you can't – you're right.”
* **Do the math.** Be rigorous, assume nothing.
* **Find the shortest path.** Use hacks, favors, and backdoors. Only take a longer road on purpose.
* **Spit it out.** Be direct, invite critique, avoid equivocation – we want right answers.
* **Be demanding and supportive.** Expect excellence from everyone and offer help to achieve it.
* **Do what it takes to be number 1.** We work hard to make sure we win.

**We provide competitive compensation with meaningful equity.** Everyone who joins early will be a major contributor to our success, and we reflect this through ownership and pay.

**We also provide rich benefits to ensure you can focus on creating impact:**

* Fully covered medical, vision, and dental insurance.
* Memberships for One Medical, Talkspace, Teladoc, and Kindbody.
* Unlimited paid time off (PTO) and 16 weeks of parental leave.
* 401K plan setup, FSA option, commuter benefits, and DashPass.
* Lunch at the office every day and Dinner at the office after 7 pm.

*Our salary ranges are based on paying competitively for our company’s size and industry, and are one part of the total compensation package that also includes equity, benefits, and other opportunities at Tandem. Individual pay decisions are ultimately based on a number of factors, including qualifications for the role, experience level, skillset, geography, and balancing internal equity.*
