**Overview**



The Care Coordinator is a critical role designed to facilitate and enhance telemedicine services, including Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) and Chronic Care Management (CCM), for patients residing in Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNF). This position serves as the pivotal link between the patients in the SNF and the remote clinical team of a third-party provider, focusing exclusively on managing and coordinating telemedicine care programs. The Care Coordinator does not perform duties within the SNF itself but rather works on behalf of a third-party company to ensure effective and successful delivery of care through telemedicine services.

  


**Responsibilities**



Act as the primary liaison between SNF patients and the remote clinical team, coordinating telemedicine services such as RPM and CCM.



Facilitate the creation and implementation of patient-centered care plans by working closely with remote healthcare providers, specifically tailored to telemedicine frameworks.



Ensure continuous monitoring and assessment of patient conditions, coordinating the flow of vital data between the SNF and the remote clinical team.



Educate and support both patients and SNF staff on the effective use of telemedicine programs, promoting optimal management of chronic conditions and healthcare outcomes.



Advocate for the patient’s needs, ensuring they receive comprehensive and effective care through the telemedicine programs.



Bridge communication and operational gaps between SNF staff and the remote clinical team to ensure seamless delivery of telemedicine services.



Manage and maintain patient records, ensuring accurate and timely communication of health data between the SNF and the remote clinical team.



Monitor and evaluate patient progress within telemedicine programs, working collaboratively with all parties to adjust care plans and interventions for better health outcomes.


**Qualifications**



Certification as a Medical Assistant or in a related healthcare field.



Experience in telemedicine, RPM, or CCM programs, with a strong understanding of care coordination within these settings.



Demonstrated ability to communicate effectively and coordinate between patients, healthcare providers, and facility staff.



Strong organizational and multitasking skills, with the capacity to manage complex care programs and detailed patient data.



Proficiency in electronic medical records (EMR) and telemedicine platforms, with a high level of digital literacy.



Knowledgeable in medical terminology, chronic condition management, and the specific requirements of telemedicine care delivery.



Independent worker with team collaboration skills, committed to enhancing patient care and outcomes through effective telemedicine coordination.


**Ideal Candidate**



The ideal candidate is a dynamic and empathetic professional, skilled in navigating the nuances of telemedicine and adept at coordinating care between remote clinical teams and patients in SNFs. This role is perfect for someone passionate about leveraging technology to improve healthcare delivery and patient outcomes in a telemedicine setting.

  


**To Apply**: Please submit your resume and a cover letter that highlights your experience with telemedicine programs, specifically RPM and CCM, and your proficiency in care coordination within these frameworks.

The world of work is changing…short commutes, flexibility, and convenience are the minimum standards employees want when it comes to how they want to work!



At IWG, we are leading the way. We’ve built the world’s largest workspace network so that our customers can work from wherever, and however, they want… in over 120 countries across the globe!



Join us and help us bring more freedom to people and businesses, while expanding our network. You’ll be able to enjoy a great work life balance and competitive benefits, while growing your career path along the way.

  


**The opportunity**



As a Community Manager, you’ll be responsible for the smooth running of your center. You’ll motivate your team to create a great working environment to ensure customer satisfaction and retention.

  


**A typical day at IWG**



You start the day with a quick review of the daily report, to plan the day and make sure everyone’s prepared.



With one eye always on reception, you see members turning up and the first meeting rooms guests arriving. You welcome them and take them to their meeting room, show them the facilities and help them set up their Wi-Fi connections and screen sharing app for their presentation.



Later you have a meeting to learn more about a new member and get to understand his business needs. You think about the other businesses in the center and how you might be able to introduce him to a couple that may be of interest at the networking event later in the week.



It’s time for a quick coffee break, relax and enjoy a few minutes to yourself.



A large company is taking a whole floor of the center and is moving in next week. You run through the move in detail with your Community Associate, ensuring the welcome kit is prepared, and all badges and keys are ready for handing over.



Shortly before your lunch break, a couple walk in enquiring about coworking membership. Your colleague from sales is on their lunch break so you offer them a coffee and give them a tour of the center, explaining all the benefits of IWG membership. You are then off to lunch.



Later in the afternoon you review billing to ensure all customers are current and walk the space to ensure everything is show ready for a tour in the morning. You notice a few light bulbs out in the café and put a ticket in the service portal for replacement. You take a few pictures of your show offices and post sales ads for your vacant office.



You’ve earned yourself another quick coffee break, relax and enjoy a few minutes to yourself.



Before heading out you review paid time off requests for next month to ensure you have appropriate coverage and prepare for a 1:1 coaching conversation with one of your team members the next day. You do a final walk around the building, speaking with members, asking how their day went as they start to wind down and head for home.

  



**About you**



We’re looking for someone who has the experience and aptitude to manage a smooth-running operation. You’ll need to be an accomplished multitasker, able to pre-empt issues before they become problems, and keep a team motivated and focused on service excellence. You also need to be:

* Experienced with leading others
* Comfortable with providing sales support
* Happy taking ownership of problems and finding ways to solve them
* Positive, enthusiastic, and able to adapt to fast-changing situations
* Experience and confidence using MS Office and other basic IT equipment
* Legally eligible to work in the Country you are applying within and at least 18 years old

  


**What we offer**



On top of a competitive total compensation package, you’ll enjoy:


* Work life balance (no standard nights/weekends)
* Generous paid time off plans (sick and vacation)
* 11 Paid Company Holidays per calendar year (in addition to your PTO accrual)
