Are you looking for a opportunity where you can use your experience to propel your career into management? At New York Life, we will invest in you from the start to help you learn and grow as a financial professional first. We’ll train you in valuable skills, such as marketing, business development, and customer relationship management, and provide you with the tools you need to further your career. Then we’ll train you and provide you with access to the tools you need for a career in management.

**What we’re looking for**  
We’re looking for people who want to make a lasting impact on the financial well-being of individuals, families, and small businesses—motivated people who can answer yes to one of the following questions:

* Do you have sales or managerial experience in another industry?
* Have you previously run your own business?
* Do you have an MBA or other equivalent degree?

In the Accelerated Path to Management Program, you’ll start off as a financial professional, learning how to sell our products, building client relationships, and meeting specific requirements1 before transitioning into a management role.  
You’ll then undergo a six-month intensive training program designed to prime you for success as a manager. You will use that experience to understand how to recruit and coach others to success.

**What we offer**

**Your first year**  
You’ll learn firsthand about a financial professional’s role and day-to-day work by working as a financial professional for the first year of your career journey with New York Life. We will provide you with complete training, access to digital tools, and a comprehensive product suite.

**Training and resources**  
You will receive top-notch training that will give you an understanding and appreciation for the strength and value of  
New York Life. Beyond this training and support, New York Life will provide access to the resources you need to succeed day-to-day, including experts on hand to answer your questions and a suite of digital sales, prospecting and marketing tools that will help you attract and retain your clients with web, social and email content.

**Product Solutions**  
You will learn about our robust products and services that can help clients and their families achieve their financial goals.  
Together with its subsidiaries, New York Life provides a range of competitive insurance and financial products, including life insurance, annuities, long-term care insurance, disability income insurance, and investment products such as mutual funds through our broker-dealer, NYLIFE Securities LLC (member of FINRA and SIPC), a Licensed Insurance  
Agency. You will be required to hold securities licenses and FINRA registrations and affiliate with NYLIFE Securities as a registered representative before you can offer investment products.

**Your transition to a Field Manager role**  
After meeting specific requirements for the first 12 months as a financial professional, you will enter a specialized six-month Associate Partner training program. We’ll help you to lead and build your team of financial professionals.  
Throughout your career journey with New York Life, you’ll continue to have opportunities to grow and be promoted to increasingly senior levels of management.

**How we will compensate you**  
When you begin with New York Life as a financial professional2, you will receive income that is commission-based.3

If you meet the requirements and approvals to become an Associate Partner, you will receive a salary. The salary range for an Associate Partner is $60,000–$150,000 (in California, the salary range is $62,400–$150,000), plus you will be eligible for additional compensation related to the agents you recruit and develop (“R&Ds”). R&Ds are additional compensation that is designed to increase your income and to reimburse for any reasonable and necessary expenses we do not otherwise reimburse. You will also be eligible for medical, dental, and vision benefits, life, long-term disability, and accidental death and dismemberment coverages, a pension plan,4 and a 401(k) savings plan.5

New York Life will value and reward your hard work and success. You’ll have significant income potential over time, because our field managers’ compensation is directly aligned with their recruiting performance and the production level of their team of financial professionals. The average income among our 586 recruiters at all levels in 2021 was $270,890.6

During this preview period of up to six months, any sales you make will continue to accrue until you either make enough sales to become a full-time agent under a Training Allowance Subsidy (TAS) Contract or the passage of six months, whichever is earlier. If you do not become a full-time agent, all commissions on any sales you made will be paid to you at the end of six months. If you become a full- time agent under a TAS Contract, you will be credited with the commissions you accrued under the Introductory Contract.

We are well on our way — but there's still an exciting journey ahead. Join us at the heart of trust.**


Our People and Community strategy is bold, clear, and meaningful: we're becoming a Destination Employer. We want people to think ""That's where I want to work one day!"" before joining Trustpilot; to feel privileged and proud to be a Trustie during their time with us; and, after moving on, to know the years they spent at Trustpilot were the very best of their career. At the heart of this is a distinct focus on building a sense of community — by creating meaningful connections in our offices around the globe, by developing and delivering a five-star workplace experience, and by bringing Trusties together for social moments that matter.



As a Community & Office Manager, you will look after our New York City community and office. You support the operationalisation and implementation of our Community & Office Strategy in New York City. You have the support of our Global Community & Office Lead, who's based in Denmark, and, on occasion, will be required to support them with wider US community and office tasks. This role offers an exciting opportunity to be fully immersed in our vibrant New York office, working five days per week in the office fostering collaboration and community.


**What you'll be doing:**


*Create meaningful connections, through:*

* Meaningful relationships – forging relationships cross-functionally within your local community; welcoming new starters on day one, assisting them to settle in; and meeting and greeting visitors.

*Develop and deliver a five-star office experience, through:*


* Slick operations and clear communication – defining, delivering, and communicating a clear service proposition; overseeing the day-to-day operations of the office; collaborating with key stakeholders on requirements; maintaining and continually improving the office environment; keeping a close eye on office feedback to make sure we're meeting and exceeding expectations; ensuring the office is an inclusive workplace.
* A safe and secure workplace – keeping our Trusties safe and secure in the office; making sure we comply with local health and safety regulations; mitigating security risks.
* Accurate budget management – inputting into budget forecasting; managing the office budget daily; and making sure invoices are paid on time.


*Bring Trusties together for social moments that matter, through:*


* Celebrations and events – organising and running local celebrations, like Trustpilot's summer and winter parties, and leading the local social committee – running the budget, delegating to committee members, and making sure activities happen; coordinating community-wide get-togethers at the end of each quarter; supporting Trusties with the logistics of their in-office events.


Additionally, you will regularly support continuous improvement project work as part of your role.


**Who you are:**


* Previous experience in a similar office management or hospitality/hotel-focused role.
* Comprehensive planning skills and demonstrated ability to handle multiple projects simultaneously.
* An empathetic individual who shows concern for the well-being of others.
* Positive with a solution-orientated, pragmatic attitude.
* Able to embrace the pace and likes it when things move fast.
* A natural communicator with a creative streak, who's a critical thinker, accurate, with attention to detail.
* Super-social and a strong collaborator.
* Capable of taking initiative, owning responsibilities, and being accountable for tasks.
* Clear and precise communication skills in English.


**What's in it for you:**


* A competitive base salary ranging from $75,000 - 83,500 gross per year. This range doesn't include any variable pay such as bonuses, awards made under Trustpilot's equity program, or other benefits.
* 20 vacation days + 2 personal days +10 paid holidays per year
* Two (paid) volunteering days a year to spend your time giving back to the causes that matter to you and your community

* Discounted club membership at Life Time Fitness
* 24/7 Employee Assistance Plan and full access to Headspace, a popular mindfulness app to promote positive mental health
* Paid parental leave for employees who have been employed for over 6 months with full scope of benefit after 12 months
* Regular opportunities to connect and get to know your fellow Trusties, including company-wide celebrations and events, ERG activities, and team socials
* A friendly, open office complete with a foosball table, roof deck with wifi (rooftop meeting anyone?!) and unlimited snacks and drinks
* Communal lunch, extra treats, and events during the month — think ice cream carts, coffee bars, and massages, to name a few

At Google, we follow a simple but vital premise: ""Focus on the user and all else will follow."" Quantitative User Experience Researchers make this possible.
  

  

Google User Experience (UX) is made up of multi-disciplinary teams of UX Designers, Researchers, Writers, Content Strategists, Program Managers, and Engineers: we care deeply about the people who use our products. The UX team plays an integral part in gathering insights about the attitudes, emotions, needs, and behaviors of people who use our products to inspire and inform design. We collaborate closely with each other and with engineering and product management to create industry-leading products that deliver value for the people who use them, and for Google’s businesses.  

  

As a Quantitative User Experience Researcher (Quant UXR), you’ll help inform your team of UXers, product managers, and engineers about user needs. You’ll play a critical role in creating useful, usable, and delightful products. You’ll work with stakeholders across functions and levels and have impact at all stages of product development.
  

  

You will investigate user behavior and user needs using empirical research methods such as logs analysis, survey research, path modeling, and regression analysis. Quant UXRs vary in background and use skills from computer science, quantitative social science, econometrics, data science, survey research, psychology, human-computer interaction, and other fields. You’ll combine skills in behavioral research design, statistical methods, and general programming to improve user experience.  

  

The Quantitative UXR community at Google will help you do your best work. You’ll have the opportunity to work with and learn from UXRs across Google through regular meetups, mentor programs, and access to internal research tools.



User experience is at the forefront of how we create intuitive, innovative, and beautiful products that people love. We strive to learn and understand our users’ needs, behaviors, and emotions to gather insights that inform product strategy and design. Our UX teams include designers, researchers, content strategists, and engineers who are passionate about quality, usability, and simplicity. We work on collaborative teams to solve complex challenges and craft experiences that highlight our products’ unique capabilities and personalities. Our work touches billions while exemplifying a key principle that is core to Google’s philosophy: “Focus on the user and all else will follow.”
