**About the Company:**  

At SPEAR, we spend each day inspiring, caring for, and elevating the New York City metro area. Together, we have built a passionate and empathetic team motivated to become the best version of itself. We respect, lead, and challenge each other to always improve ourselves, our teammates, and the health of our communities.
  
At our core, we develop people. By providing each other the ideal opportunities and tools to flourish—both personally and professionally—we have fostered a culture rooted in growth. And we have fun doing it!
  
This focus on professional development and organizational expansion has resulted in our collective achievement of several honors and recognitions from top medical, academic, and business communities. SPEAR recently received Columbia University’s Award for Leadership in Clinical Education, given to the top 1/10th of 1% of practices. SPEAR was named six times to the Inc5000 list of fastest growing private companies in America, as well as having been named by SmartCEO magazine as a Future500 company five times. SPEAR was also chosen to appear in Chase Bank’s National Ad Campaign, Mission Main Street, as a thriving small business committed to serving community interests. SPEAR was the first private practice to ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange when on May 4th, 2016, during small business week, the executive team was featured on MSNBC.
  
  

In 2016, SPEAR Physical Therapy was chosen as the American Physical Therapy Association Private Practice Section’s “Nation’s Top Practice,” recognizing the company for its dedication to innovation and excellence.
  
  

In 2020, at the peak of the pandemic, the SPEAR Physical Therapy team dedicated themselves to the New York City community. This dedication was a testament to the unrelenting commitment that SPEAR providers have for their patients—the resilience the team demonstrated, and the innovative care provided to our patients–during the events of 2020 are what led SPEAR to be awarded “The Nation’s Top Practice” by the WebPT Ascend Conference. To be recognized during this historically difficult year was a proud moment for the organization and all our incredibly devoted team members.
  
  

In the years to come, SPEAR will continue its path of growth, with further expansion planned beyond the New York City Metropolitan region.

A cooperative education experience, commonly known as a ""Co-Op"", provides academic credit for a structured job experience during a school term (semester, trimester, etc.) and can begin as early as a student’s junior year.

Our hope is this program grows to have more than one student for a period of up to six months each term, during the Fall and Spring Semester. For students who are undecided in their career direction, but still interested in the consulting industry, to the greatest extent possible, H2M may create a rotation schedule so the student can work with multiple disciplines in the organization. Whereby, giving Co-Op students an opportunity to hone in on their discipline.
  
  

**General guidelines:** With general guidance of the departmental/discipline manager, the Co-Op student will report for day-to-day activities to a Project level employee or above.
  
* The student will be paid on an hourly basis and will not be eligible for any H2M benefits.
* The position will be full-time, 40 hours a week, Monday to Friday. Since this position is eligible for overtime pay at time and one half of their regular rate only chargeable work should be allocated for this purpose.
* It is the responsibility of the co-op student to ensure that their program and university needs are being met.


**General job responsibilities will include:**  

* General administrative tasks.
* Perform various calculations to support design projects and solve complex problems.
* Assist project managers with construction drawings and specifications.
* Perform/observe field work as needed
* Computer drafting using AutoCAD and Revit.
* Tabulate and analyze data, generate tables and charts

**The Role**



We are seeking a Product Designer to lead the vision and execution of our enterprise products. Our goal is nothing short of creating a remarkable, differentiated product experience — in an industry that has seen little to no innovation in decades. Among other workstreams, your primary responsibility will be to lead design within an ecosystem of enterprise products that provide data, insights, and tools for our real estate partners.

**Responsibilities**


* Problem solve, think big, and explore divergent concepts/ideas while understanding how to converge and build iteratively towards your vision.
* Influence the shape of the enterprise product with research and data while executing design work using high quality wireframes, mockups, user journeys, and cross-platform interactive prototypes.
* Advocate for design by sharing your work and presenting cross-functionally, while being able to precisely articulate design rationale.
* Inspire the entire team (including your cross-functional partners) by bringing new ideas to the table.
* Create a unified, end-to-end experience through close collaboration with the Product and Engineering Teams.
* Contribute to a cohesive customer journey through close collaboration with Brand Design, Marketing, and Sales, particularly as it relates to the visualization of data.

  


**Requirements and Qualifications**


* 5+ years of experience working in UX, UI, HCI related fields with experience working on mobile.
* Experience designing on multiple platforms (e.g., iOS, Android, Mobile Web, Desktop).
* Excellent oral and written communication skills.
* Highly proficient with design tools (e.g., Figma, Photoshop, Illustrator).
* Highly proficient with interactive prototyping tools (e.g., Framer, Principle, Origami, Invision Studio).
* Proven track record with building complete design systems.
* Excellence in design craft.
* Ability to work with a low-ego, highly collaborative, cross-functional team.
* Excited about working in a fast-paced, dynamic startup environment.

Using Solution Based Casework, we actively work with parents to help them develop a more active, consistent and productive role in their child’s educational and social development; we encourage families to build connections to positive supports in their community who will help them sustain their progress.

* **Check Ego at the Door:** It’s not about you. Don’t let your ego get in the way of doing what’s best for the team. Worrying about who gets credit or taking things personally is counterproductive. Make sure every decision is based solely on advancing team goals and doing what’s best for the customer.

* **Debate, then Align:** Healthy, vigorous debate creates better solutions. Debate concepts without making personal attacks. Check your ego and push for the best solution, rather than your solution. Once a decision is made, however, get fully aligned by putting your complete support behind it.
* **Fix Problems at the Source:** Address issues by discovering the root cause rather than simply tackling the symptoms. It’s better to invest time in developing a long-term solution rather than simply applying a “Band-Aid.”
* **Get the Facts:** There’s always more to the story than you think. Learn to ask questions and gather the facts before jumping to conclusions and making judgments. Be curious about additional information that might yield a more complete picture.
* **Make Quality Personal:** Demonstrate a passion for excellence and take pride in the quality of everything you touch and everything you do. Have a healthy dislike for mediocrity. Good is not good enough. Always ask yourself, “Is this my best work?”
* **Walk in your Customer’s Shoes:** Understand your customers' world. Know their challenges and frustrations. See the world from their perspective. The better you understand them, the more effectively you can anticipate and meet their needs.
* **Get Clear on Expectations:** Create clarity and avoid misunderstandings by discussing expectations upfront. Set expectations for others and ask when you’re not clear on what they expect of you. End all meetings with clarity about action items, responsibilities, and due dates.
* **Listen to Understand:** Listening is more than simply “not speaking.” Give others your undivided attention. Be present and engaged. Minimize the distractions and let go of the need to agree or disagree. Suspend your judgment and be curious to know more, rather than jumping to conclusions.
* **Speak Straight:** Speak honestly in a way that helps to make progress. Say what you mean, and be willing to ask questions, share ideas, or raise issues that may cause conflict when it’s necessary for team success. Be courageous enough to say what needs to be said. Address issues directly with those who are involved or affected.
* **Find a Way:** Take personal responsibility for making things happen. Respond to every situation by looking for how we can do it, rather than explaining why it can’t be done. Be resourceful and show initiative. Don’t make excuses or wait for others to solve the problem. See issues through to their completion.
* **Show Meaningful Appreciation:** Recognize people doing things right, rather than pointing out when they do things wrong. Regularly extend *meaningful* acknowledgment and appreciation — in all directions throughout our organization.
* **Keep Things Fun:** While our passion for excellence is real, remember that the world has bigger problems than the daily challenges that make up our work. Stuff happens. Keep perspective. Don’t take things personally or take yourself too seriously. Laugh every day.
