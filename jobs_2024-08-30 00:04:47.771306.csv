Please answer all Pre-Screening Questions to be considered for this position.

**Who We Are**

Grayson Executive Learning is a boutique coaching company that specializes in providing high-level academic coaching to students with ADHD and executive function deficits. Our research-based approach helps students struggling with ADHD and executive function deficits to effectively manage deadlines and succeed in school. We use the work our clients are assigned by their teachers and professors to teach them how to effectively manage their time as well as plan ahead and organize themselves to meet the demands and expectations placed upon them. We equip our students with the tools, skills, and knowledge to continue to succeed in school and other areas of their life long after services end. We are a company that truly cares about people and creating positive and lasting change.

**Who We Serve**

We specialize helping high school and college students who have ADHD or executive function deficits. Our clients are not fulfilling their potential in school due to difficulties with time management, planning, organization, procrastination, prioritization, task initiation, and poor study skills. The work we do is incredibly important and the positive impact our coaches have on our clients literally changes lives.

**About the Position**

* This is a 100% remote position and offers flexible scheduling.
* Using our proprietary research-based approach, coaches work 1:1 to help students learn to effectively meet deadlines and succeed in school.
* Teach strategies and help students develop skills in the areas of time management, planning, organization, overcoming procrastination, as well as advanced study skills.
* Engage students in thought-provoking questions and conversations that organically facilitate positive behavior change without telling students what to do.
* Provide case management and coordinate services with teachers, therapists, psychiatrists, and special education advocates.

**Compensation**

We believe in compensating our coaches well and starting compensation is between $45-$60/hr depending on related experience and education.

**Hiring Process:**

In addition to meeting our qualification criteria, we are strictly looking for educational professionals for whom going above and beyond and producing at the level of excellence is all they know. Our clients expect a lot from our coaches and we are not a good fit for an individual who feels uncomfortable being held accountable to excellence.

Our hiring process is as follows:

* Submit your resume, cover letter, and application
* Qualified candidates will be contacted via email to schedule a screening interview (done over Zoom)
* Candidates that advance past the screening interview will be invited to a final interview
* We check references and conduct background checks prior to employment

**Responsibilities**

* Candidates are required to be available Monday-Thursday to coach 5-15 hours per week
* Although early afternoon hours may be available, candidates must be available weekday afternoon and evenings after 4:30 pm
* Coaches must also have high speed internet access that can reliably support video conferencing as well as a quiet place for rendering coaching sessions

**Personal Qualities**

We are looking for educational professionals:

* Who are genuinely interested in making a difference in the lives of young people with ADHD
* Who possess tremendous empathy and kindness for those who struggle
* Whose core values include a commitment to excellence, high standards in professional competency, and a very strong work ethic
* Who want to work for a company where they will be treated with respect, be appreciated for their skills and talents, and wish to be part of a small but growing company whose primary existence is to create positive change in the lives of students with ADHD
* Who are highly personable and able to build rapport with students who are respectful but may possess poor social skills
* The secret keyword is: change
* Who are highly trainable, possess a growth mindset, and are willing to follow a structured coaching program in the exact manner as they are trained
* Due to the extensive training and investment we make in each coach, we are only looking for educational professionals seeking long-term employment with us. We are not a good fit for individuals that are primarily looking for a short-term position or something to hold them over between jobs.
* Who have good time management and organizational skills, are punctual, and reliable

**Qualifications**

* Bachelor's degree or higher in education or a related field (Master’s preferred)
* 8 years of experience is preferred
* Background as a:
* Special education teacher

**Who We Are**

Grayson Executive Learning is a boutique coaching company that specializes in providing high-level academic coaching to students with ADHD and executive function deficits. Our research-based approach helps students struggling with ADHD and executive function deficits to effectively manage deadlines and succeed in school. We use the work our clients are assigned by their teachers and professors to teach them how to effectively manage their time as well as plan ahead and organize themselves to meet the demands and expectations placed upon them. We equip our students with the tools, skills, and knowledge to continue to succeed in school and other areas of their life long after services end. We are a company that truly cares about people and creating positive and lasting change.

**Who We Serve**

We specialize helping high school and college students who have ADHD or executive function deficits. Our clients are not fulfilling their potential in school due to difficulties with time management, planning, organization, procrastination, prioritization, task initiation, and poor study skills. The work we do is incredibly important and the positive impact our coaches have on our clients literally changes lives.

**About the Position**

* This is a 100% remote position and offers flexible scheduling.
* Using our proprietary research-based approach, coaches work 1:1 to help students learn to effectively meet deadlines and succeed in school.
* Teach strategies and help students develop skills in the areas of time management, planning, organization, overcoming procrastination, as well as advanced study skills.
* Engage students in thought-provoking questions and conversations that organically facilitate positive behavior change without telling students what to do.
* Provide case management and coordinate services with teachers, therapists, psychiatrists, and special education advocates.

**Compensation**

We believe in compensating our coaches well and starting compensation is between $45-$60/hr depending on related experience and education.

**Hiring Process:**

In addition to meeting our qualification criteria, we are strictly looking for educational professionals for whom going above and beyond and producing at the level of excellence is all they know.

Our hiring process is as follows:

* Submit your resume, cover letter, and application
* Qualified candidates will be contacted via email to schedule a screening interview (done over Zoom)
* Candidates that advance past the screening interview will be invited to a final interview
* We check references and conduct background checks prior to employment

**Responsibilities**

* Candidates are required to be available Monday-Thursday to coach 5-15 hours per week
* Although early afternoon hours may be available, candidates must be available weekday afternoon and evenings after 4:30 pm
* Coaches must also have high speed internet access that can reliably support video conferencing as well as a quiet place for rendering coaching sessions

**Personal Qualities**

We are looking for educational professionals:

* Who are genuinely interested in making a difference in the lives of young people with ADHD
* Who possess tremendous empathy and kindness for those who struggle
* Whose core values include a commitment to excellence, high standards in professional competency, and a very strong work ethic
* Who want to work for a company where they will be treated with respect, be appreciated for their skills and talents, and wish to be part of a small but growing company whose primary existence is to create positive change in the lives of students with ADHD
* Who are highly personable and able to build rapport with students who are respectful but may possess poor social skills
* The secret keyword is: change
* Who are highly trainable, possess a growth mindset, and are willing to follow a structured coaching program in the exact manner as they are trained
* Due to the extensive training and investment we make in each coach, we are only looking for educational professionals seeking long-term employment with us. We are not a good fit for individuals that are primarily looking for a short-term position or something to hold them over between jobs.
* Who have good time management and organizational skills, are punctual, and reliable

* 8 years of experience is preferred

----------------


**Execute game-changing advertising strategies that tie engagement to the bottom line.** As a Media Strategist, you'll manage the execution of digital advertising campaigns across clients ranging from leading nonprofits to political and advocacy groups to major brands (and everything in between).



This may be the right role for you if you're someone who is equally strategic, creative, and analytical. Switching seamlessly from a client presentation, to writing an insightful analysis of campaign performance, and rolling up your sleeves to launch new creative are no big deal for you. You're used to spending most of your day speaking in acronyms — terms like DSP, CPA, IVT, ROAS, and AVOC are major parts of your vocabulary — and you know how to explain them to clients and teammates.



You will use your depth of paid media experience to inform your work but also tap into your digital curiosity and passion for innovation to bring new ideas and thinking to the team.


**The company**
---------------



Blue State is a purpose-driven agency. We partner with leading causes, brands, and campaigns and create real change. From Google and UNICEF to Amnesty International and Oxfam, we transform how brands and causes raise money, influence policy, build platforms, and grow communities of supporters. Led by the most creative and analytical minds from the political, nonprofit, and brand worlds, Blue State is a part of WPP Digital and has 150+ employees in the US and London.


**The team**
------------



As part of the Paid Media team, you'll work closely with a cross-disciplinary group of Blue State employees who are passionate, geeky, and care about their clients and causes. Blue State fosters an environment where everyone has an opportunity to shape new approaches, grow and learn from their colleagues, and take advantage of a personal development fund to stretch their skills even further. You'll have the opportunity to work with some of the most inspiring charities, ambitious brands, and passionate advocacy and social change campaigns.


**A day in the life**
---------------------


* **Build, manage, and optimize media campaigns across multiple platforms,** primarily using Facebook Business Manager, Google and Bing Ads, Google Campaign Manager 360, and the Verizon Media DSP. (Other digital channel expertise is a plus.)
* **Analyze ongoing and historical performance data** to identify opportunities for improvement, make strategic recommendations, and generate reporting and insights to drive optimization.
* **Have a strong POV on measurement, attribution, and conversion tracking,** and apply that knowledge to strategic recommendations and ongoing campaign management.
* **Participate in client-facing interactions** — you'll be the subject-matter expert for the platforms you manager
* **Work collaboratively with other internal or external teams,** including media planners, strategists, account directors, designers, and analysts, to produce campaigns, creative ideas, audience and target recommendations, and experimental designs.

**Some things we're looking for**
---------------------------------


* 2-4 years experience in a hands-on paid media buying role using a mix of digital channels (Social, Search, Display, Video, Native, OOH, etc) - with preference to experience in executing, managing, and reporting on media campaigns with a mix of objectives/goals.
* Ability to effectively manage multiple clients and projects on time, within budget, and meet performance goals.
* High proficiency with digital advertising platforms — you ultimately want to become a master of paid social, paid search, and/or programmatic trading — as well as Google Analytics and other measurement platforms
* Exceptional attention to detail, especially with regards to campaign setup and trafficking, QA, and reporting.
* Ability to adapt to new situations, solve problems on the fly, and communicate with those around you. Teamwork and scrappiness required.
* A testing evangelist - no result is ever a problem as long as we can learn and improve in future.
* Humble in victory, constructive in defeat. We champion and expect empathy, communication, collaboration, and respect.


The salary range for this position is $70-$85 an hour; compensation will be commensurate with experience.



At Blue State, diversity is a necessity, not a nice-to-have. We encourage those from underrepresented communities — women, people of color, LGBTQIA+, immigrants, those with disabilities and people at all the intersections in between — to apply. Even if you don't think your current skill set checks every box, but this role seems to align with your strengths, we want to hear from you.



Blue State is committed to creating an inclusive and accessible application and interview process. If you would like to request a reasonable accommodation for a disability, including the use of AI tools throughout the hiring process, please contact us at recruiting@bluestate.co with the **subject line: Accommodation Request** to get started.
