 **Our vision**  

We’re starting by helping independent restaurants succeed online.  

But it’s not just restaurants that need our help. All local service-based businesses are struggling with these same problems. Huge technology corporations are taking their customers, bleeding their profits, and making it hard for them to survive.  

So, once we nail the solution for restaurants – we’ll scale it into every other local business type.  

In the future we envision, we’ll build the technology that tens of millions of local business owners need to succeed in the digital age.* **Our team**

  

Our team grew from 40 people to 90 people in 2023. We’ve got top talent from the most successful companies in SMB software like Shopify, HubSpot, DoorDash, ProCore, and ServiceTitan.  

We’re scaling even faster in 2024 to keep pace with our customer growth.  

**Our traction**  

In just over 3 years we've generated tens of millions in revenue, served millions of guests, and have processed hundreds of millions of orders.  

More importantly, we’ve helped thousands of restaurant owners save their businesses - and not only survive, but thrive. **Why we’re looking for you**  

As a Launch Specialist you will be the first to welcome a newly-signed partner to the Owner platform. Strong communication skills are a must to ensure alignment on expectations so that the restaurant has the highest quality website launch, as soon as possible. Strong organizational skills are also vital because you’ll be balancing a portfolio of partners, all in different stages of the onboarding journey.  

This is a fast-paced, KPI-focused role so attention to detail is key – your days will be spent managing a high volume of inbound/outbound emails, calls, and SMS messages from your partners. This gives you a unique opportunity to perfect your time management and client-facing skills. You’ll also partner closely with our product and engineering teams and have the opportunity to shape the future of the product.  

We use Salesforce to log all activity; your success will be measured by your ability to collect necessary assets and information, coordinate internally across multiple teams, set proper expectations ahead of launch, and ensure a smooth handoff to the Customer Success Manager.
###  **The impact you will have**

+ Advocate for restaurant owners so that they maintain ownership of their online presence
+ Coach and educate restaurant owners on the best practices for their online ordering setup, backed by statistics and rigorous SEO testing by our product team.
+ Work on projects and initiatives that improve our internal processes
+ Impact the Owner platform design by providing relevant product feedback to our engineering team
+ Partner and collaborate successfully with cross-functional teams

### **✅ Minimum requirements**

+ Ability to effectively manage multiple accounts, all at various stages of the onboarding journey
+ Growth mindset: you are a lifelong learner and committed to professional growth and development
+ Solutions-oriented and can identify issues and take appropriate action/ownership
+ You thrive while working in a fast-paced environment where change is common
+ Reliable high-speed internet connection to support audio conferencing and other online tools
+ Proven experience working autonomously in a remote work environment
+ Fluent Spanish and English speaker with excellent spoken and written communication skills in both languages
+ It’s a plus if you’ve worked in the restaurant industry at least 1 year

###  **Pay and benefits**

+ The estimated yearly compensation for this role is between the local equivalent to $30,000 - 35,000 USD, with the potential of additional benefits depending on experience and location.
+ Other benefits include comprehensive health coverage, flexible/unlimited PTO - plus extra fun perks!","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Train-With-Ellie","http://www.trainwithellie.com","","","","","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/5499625566dfda277e329776cc03f37f","","",""

Today our agency continues to address the emotional and physical needs of children and families in Brooklyn, Queens and across Long Island through innovative treatments and life-changing interventions. We provide community-based prevention and family foster care services, group homes in the community for struggling children and families within the child welfare and juvenile justice systems, and short-term residential services for unaccompanied migrant children. Each year, MercyFirst serves more than 3,000 children, teenagers and families overcome enormous obstacles, re-imagine their futures and develop their full potential.
  
  

**PROGRAM BACKGROUND:**  

The bridges to the future program supports our foster care youth as they prepare for the future. The program provides teens and young adults with skills and testing to secure viable jobs, scholarship assistance to attend college or vocational school, obtain and maintain affordable housing in the community, and life skills coaches to guide them during the challenging transition from foster care to adulthood.
  
  

**POSITION SUMMARY:**  

The position will be working with our Family Foster Care & Residential Care Programs. Coaches meet young people “where they are” and build a trusting relationship with them using an authentic, trauma-informed, strength-based approach.

When a young person is unsure of their goals/interests, Coaches help them explore and expose them to potential opportunities. They then help young people connect to schools, programs, and opportunities in line with their goals/interests, persist in those settings, and plan/prepare for the next step on their journey.

The Housing Advocate works with street homeless conducting street outreach with the objective of engaging individuals to determine their eligibility for Street to Home services and to help secure appropriate housing solutions for all people who are street homeless.

StaffCo is a Professional Employer Organization, commonly referred to as a PEO, duly organized and registered under the New York Professional Employer Organization law. StaffCo and SUNY have entered into a professional employer agreement under which StaffCo is the employer of Stony Brook Clinical Practice Management Plan employees and responsible for all aspects of employment, including hirings, promotions, disciplines, terminations, the day-to-day direction and supervision of work, as well as labor relations and collective bargaining. StaffCo is fully responsible for providing all payroll and human resources services, including the payment of wages, collecting and reporting payroll taxes and maintaining any and all employee benefits. SUNY Stony Brook Hospital is responsible for the operation of the hospital and provision of health care and is the co-employer as is necessary to conduct its responsibilities and for related licensure, regulatory or statutory requirements and obligations.

  

Given StaffCo’s employment responsibilities, it is deemed the “employer” for employment and labor law purposes. Thus, the employees are private sector employees of StaffCo, not public sector employees of SUNY. The private sector nature of the StaffCo employees has been approved by NYS Civil Service and upheld in a decision by the US National Labor Relations Board.

Our Balanced Learning® approach was developed with early learning experts. It provides clear daily plans so you can focus your time in the classroom on forming connections with the children—and spend your time outside of school focused on yourself.  

Classrooms come fully stocked with everything you need, and our supportive Leadership Team works every day to create a safe, healthy environment and a culture where all children and team members can thrive.  

And if that’s not enough, just wait until you help a child learn something new and see their face light up with excitement.
