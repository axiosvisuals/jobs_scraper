Our AI-powered platform was purpose-built for medical conversations, improving clinical documentation efficiencies while enabling clinicians to focus on what matters most—their patients.


Our enterprise-grade technology transforms patient-clinician conversations into structured clinical notes in real-time, with deep EMR integrations. Powered by Linked Evidence and our purpose-built, auditable AI, we are the only company that maps AI-generated summaries to ground truth, helping providers quickly trust and verify the output. As pioneers in generative AI for healthcare, we are setting the industry standards for the responsible deployment of AI across health systems.


We are a growing team of practicing MDs, AI scientists, PhDs, creatives, technologists, and engineers working together to empower people and make care make more sense.

**The Role**

* Collaborate with cross-functional teams to identify, plan, and deliver the IT projects required to support our growth. This role may require occasional travel to set up and support US-based offices.

* Experienced working in a regulated environment. You have implemented compliance frameworks such as SOC2 and HITRUST
* Experienced with endpoint management solutions for both Mac + Windows. We are primarily Mac-based, and you must have several years of experience supporting a fleet of Apple hardware. You probably have some strong opinions about tools like JAMF and Addigy

* A fantastic communicator who collaborates effectively with stakeholders at all levels of the organization
* Excited about being hands-on in a fast-moving, productive, and supportive environment
* Willing to pitch in wherever needed. As a fast-moving startup, we need to do good work quickly
* Relevant certifications (e.g., CISSP, CISM, ITIL) are a plus


We value people who want to learn new things, and we know that great team members might not perfectly match a job description. If you’re interested in the role but aren’t sure whether or not you’re a good fit, we’d still like to hear from you.

**Base Salary:** $170,000 - $235,000+ USD per year + Equity (DOE)


The salary range provided is based on transparent pay guidelines and is an estimate for candidates residing in the San Francisco and New York City metro areas.

Additionally, this role may include the opportunity to participate in a company stock option plan as part of the total compensation package.

**Must be willing to work from our SF or NYC office 2-3x/week**

**Life at Abridge**
-------------------


At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.


Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

**Diversity & Inclusion**
-------------------------


Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

**Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud**
----------------------------------------------------------


We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process. Any emails from the Abridge recruiting team will come from an @abridge.com email address. You can learn more about how to protect yourself from these types of fraud by referring to this article.
