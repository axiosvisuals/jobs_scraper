*Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God…*  
*…For if we love one another, God abides in us, and God’s love will be perfected in us.*

1 John 4:7,12

At Trinity, love is at the very core of our faith and ministry. Our mission then is simple: to love God and to love our neighbor. This conviction leads us to respect the dignity of all people, welcome the stranger, embrace our enemy, demonstrate radical hospitality, reach out to help those who are marginalized and in need, be advocates for justice and peace, and maintain a genuine commitment to inclusivity and diversity in our church family.

**Job Description**

Position Title: Director of Children, Youth, and Family Ministries  
Congregation: Trinity Church, Asbury Park, New Jersey  
Job Type: Part-time position  
Work Hours: Approximately 10 hours per week  
Proposed Compensation Package: $25 per hour

Trinity Church is an Episcopal parish with a progressive theological and social outlook that values life-long Christian education and spiritual formation. The congregation is thriving with a growing number of young families as members. This adds new life and vitality to an already active church.

The Director of Children, Youth, and Family Ministries (CYF Director) will play an essential role in the spiritual health and vitality of this evolving community of faith. The CYF Director will be responsible for planning, programming, and implementing a spiritual formation ministry program that engages, educates, and enriches the lives of the children of this parish and their families in accordance with the teachings and rites of the Episcopal Church. The CYF Director will work to integrate the children of the parish in every aspect of the life and worship of Trinity Church. The program is currently primarily geared toward younger children, but as our children age, we need to begin building stronger youth programs. We would also like to start a music program for children, in partnership with our Director of Music and Arts. We understand that the CYF portfolio is extensive, but the Director is not expected to shoulder all the work alone; part of the job will be recruiting and empowering volunteer leaders to help expand the capacity of the program. In time, as our church and CYF program grow, we would like the Director position to grow as well. The CYF Director will report to the Rector and Director of Operations.

- With the Director of Music and Arts, design and implement avenues to include children and youth in a choral music program.  
- Develop and implement family engagement programs  
- Ensure the safety of the children and adults involved in all CYF programs  
- Develop and implement safety protocols and standards  
- Hold regular listening sessions with parents and guardians to gain input on needs  
- Communicate with parents and guardians on a regular basis  
- Ensure that teachers and assistants have the supplies and support needed  
- Coordinate children and youth activities for various parish events  
- Plan for the inclusion of children and youth of all abilities in programs  
- Serve as the contact person for Diocesan children/youth events, education, and trainings  
- Responsible for developing, training, supporting and nurturing a children/youth ministry staff of volunteers to assist in every aspect of the CYF ministry, including Nursery, Sunday School, and middle and high school programs  
- Responsible for staffing the nursery with trained, competent, nurturing staff, both volunteer and paid  
- Develop and implement seasonal programs and events  
- Manage the CYF page of the parish website  
- Prepare and manage the approved CYF program budget.  
- Other duties as assigned

**Skills/Requirements:**  
- Be able to work comfortably and effectively with children of all ages and abilities and their families  
- Be a practicing Christian who is comfortable promoting the teachings and policies of the Episcopal Church and Trinity Church, Asbury Park  
- Be comfortable working for a progressive church that values spirituality, social justice, and the arts  
- Comfort and fluency in various social media networks  
- Excellent organizational, administrative, and communication skills  
- Knowledgeable of and ability to comply with all policies regarding contact with children and youth as established by Trinity Episcopal Church and the Diocese of New Jersey  
- Sensitive to the needs and concerns of our community’s diverse population, including a commitment to equity and inclusion for all people  
- Ability to maintain confidentiality of sensitive information

Position requires the successful completion of a background check and Safe Church Training. Trinity employees are expected to respect diversity and promote equity and inclusion for all people.

**Hours**  
The CYF Director will work approximately 10 hours per week, including Sundays and occasional evenings/Saturdays. There is some allowance for working a portion of the hours remotely. The position is primarily September-early June, but some summer programs would be desirable. Hours/availability and time off are to be determined in consultation with the Rector.

**Proposed Salary**  
The CYF Director shall be paid $25 per hour, with the possibility of cost-of-living adjustments. This position does not include benefits.

**Non-Discrimination and Diversity Policy**

**Who We Are**  

CCR Princeton and its sister institutions, CCR La Jolla and CCS Bowie, form the Center for Communications and Computing, a federally funded research and development center (FFRDC) that is a division of the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA). We work under a long-term contract to the National Security Agency to address scientific problems related to its mission. We are a collaborative research institution looking to add self-motivated colleagues  

who like working on hard problems. Solutions often come from interdisciplinary collaboration, drawing on knowledge from mathematics, computer science, statistics, and signals analysis. Some projects require deep and sophisticated mathematics, others the latest computational technologies, and many require both.

  

**How We Work**  

We have a shared-credit environment and a flat organizational structure. Collaboration is encouraged by an ""open door"" policy, informal conversations at daily tea, regular seminars, and easy access to spontaneous discussion sessions. The result is small, flexible working groups, with researchers free to choose what to work on according to their interests and expertise. Each summer we hold an intensive ten-week program, SCAMP (Summer  

Conference on Applied Mathematical Problems), where researchers from academia, government, and industry come in to collaborate with our research staff on focused problems that change from year to year. Rather than recruiting in specific subfields, we are looking for creative Ph.D.s who will help build on the body of knowledge in the external and internal literature. In addition to internal work, we encourage continued academic research, and support travel to both internal and external conferences.

  

**Location and Requirements**  

CCR Princeton is located in Princeton, New Jersey. We maintain close relations with Princeton University and the Institute for Advanced Study, both of which are nearby. Princeton is a bikeable, cosmopolitan town with excellent schools, high-quality options for dining and the arts, and easy access to New York and Philadelphia. You must be a US citizen and be able to obtain an appropriate security clearance, which we will sponsor. Researchers may be able to begin work without a security clearance, performing unclassified or academic work while awaiting clearance. The start date for this position is flexible.

  

**Benefits and How to Apply**  

CCR Princeton offers a competitive salary and excellent benefits, including moving expenses, medical and dental insurance, 11% contribution towards an employee’s retirement plan (403(b)), HSA or FSA, life and disability insurance, and an on-site gym. Our work schedule is extremely flexible and offers a healthy work-life balance with generous vacation time. To apply, please use MathJobs.org. See below information to submit on MathJobs.org. Applications received by November 17, 2024, will receive full consideration, but those received after that date will still be accepted.
