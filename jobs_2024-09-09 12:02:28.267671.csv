Tired of job ads that beat around the bush? Us too. Here’s the deal: this job is not for the weak. If you’re looking for a cushy, easy gig, **this isn’t it**. You’ll be knocking on doors in Bergen County, NJ. Yes, **knocking on doors**. It’s not glamorous, but if you’re willing to put in the effort, you’ll make very good money. We’re talking $2,500 to $5,000 a week or more working less than 30 hours a week. There really is no ceiling.

**Here’s how it works:**

* You’ll knock on approximately 25 doors per hour.
* Out of 100 doors, around 30-35 people will actually answer.
* If you’re new to this, expect to get 1 appointment for every 30 conversations.
* Seasoned reps? They can land 1 appointment for every 10 conversations. (don't worry, we will turn you into a seasoned rep.)
* Every 6 verified appointments pretty much guarantees a sale.
* **One sale = $2,500 to $7,500 in your pocket.** That’s real money, and it adds up fast.

If you’re **committed** and put in the hours, you can easily book 1 appointment per day. That means at least 1 sale a week. Do the math – increase your appointments to 10-12 per week, that's a couple of sales per week, and you’re making serious money.

**But here’s the catch:**

* This is full commission. No hourly, no safety net. If you don’t sell, you don’t make money. Simple as that. But we will coach, train and guide.
* It’s tough, and you have to want it. If you’re weak, lazy, or afraid of rejection, don’t apply.
* If you’re hungry, driven, and want uncapped earnings, we’ll show you **exactly how** to do this. We have it down to a science – and yes, we’ll train you to succeed.

You’ll get all the guidance and training needed to close deals. We know what works, we’ve got the numbers, and we can show you how to hit your goals. But at the end of the day, **it’s on you**.

So, if you like the idea of being in control of your paycheck, working hard, and making money like you’ve never made before, this is for you.

Ready? Apply now and let’s see what you’ve got.
