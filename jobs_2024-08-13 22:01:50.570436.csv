The Met presents over 5,000 years of art from around the world for everyone to experience and enjoy. The Museum lives in two iconic sites in New York City—The Met Fifth Avenue and The Met Cloisters. Millions of people also take part in The Met experience online.
Since its founding in 1870, The Met has always aspired to be more than a treasury of rare and beautiful objects. We are committed to fostering a collaborative and respectful work environment with a staff as diverse as the audiences we engage. Our staff members are art lovers who are passionate about working toward a common goal: creating the most dynamic and inspiring art museum in the world.
At The Met, every staff member – from security officers to researchers to scientists and beyond – lives by our core values of respect, inclusivity, collaboration, excellence, and integrity.
Respect: Engage one another with collegiality, empathy, and kindness, always.
Inclusivity: Ensure that all are and feel welcome and valued.
Collaboration: Reach across boundaries to exchange ideas and work together toward our shared mission.
Excellence: Lead the cultural world in quality and expertise—and inspire curiosity and creativity.
Integrity: Hold ourselves to the highest moral standards, admit when we fall short, and then evolve.
About the Department
The project to renovate The Met’s galleries for the art of the ancient Near East (also referred to as West Asia) will reimagine the stories and spaces that present the objects from this region to the public; powerfully affirming the place of non-Western art at the heart of The Met; and facilitating infrastructure upgrades that align with strategic goals around sustainability and accessibility. The galleries will illustrate the beauty, history, and cultural diversity of a vast region encompassing Iraq, Iran, Central Asia, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Jordan, and Yemen. The renovation will re-center this collection in integrative and forward-thinking ways, engaging a general audience as well as NY-based heritage communities and diaspora groups whose histories are displayed within the galleries. Designed by the architectural firm NADAAA, the galleries will integrate architectural features and materials that reinforce new curatorial frameworks and regional perspectives, expanding the perspectives, narratives, and interpretations developed by the curators. Didactics will be rethought, with an emphasis on the works’ ancient and modern histories. Major forms of visual expression surveyed relate to themes such as the natural and supernatural, materiality, image making, text and image, and ordering the universe. Giving voice and making visible the artistic dynamism through digital features and prompts to additional online content will contribute to a refreshed understanding of the art of ancient West Asia. Overall, this project seeks to foster care and concern for the objects, people, communities, and diverse histories represented within this collection.

The grounds for the Peddie Golf Course were originally the 44-acre farm of Walter C. Black. In 1876, Joseph Black started Village Nurseries, a business continually run by the Black family even through the year 2000. Black’s daughter, Nettie, married local insurance agent C. Stanley Stults, also an avid golfer. Stults, with his father-in-law, and many local businessmen laid out the original 9- hole course in 1923 on Black’s nursery around the Christmas tree farm, orchards, and nursery stock. When the depression hit in 1929, the local businessmen could no longer afford its upkeep and taxes. The course was “sold” to Peddie for $1.00 in exchange for life rights for Walter and his wife Sarah to remain in their house and their children to use the course. The original 9 holes remained substantially the same until 1952 when it was expanded to 18 holes utilizing the remaining acreage of the nursery and the adjacent land of William Thompson. Golf course superintendent and Professional Burtis Parker laid out the remaining 9 holes. He did so saving many of the unique species of trees that were on the nursery, many of which remain today including maples, spruce, pine, oaks, elms, chestnuts, apples, magnolias, tulip and the original Christmas tree farm, the first in NJ. 8 of the original greens are still intact on the 18-hole design.

Our culture thrives on three promises: boldness is possibility, empathy is progress, and curiosity is momentum.  

At Edelman, we understand diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging (DEIB) transform our colleagues, our company, our clients, and our communities. We are in relentless pursuit of an equitable and inspiring workplace that is respectful of all, reflects and represents the world in which we live, and fosters trust, collaboration and belonging.  

Edelman is looking for an Art Director to help us make things that culture will love. Our growing creative teams are the masterminds behind some of the world’s most talked about work. Whether launching an eBay sneaker shop, fighting for intersectional environmental justice with TAZO Tea, or creating a hotel for the world's most devoted Taco Bell fans, the work we create is designed to capture attention and get people talking. It’s not enough to be culturally relevant—our briefs demand that we change culture around us. Now we need a strong Art Director who can help unlock more of those weird, wild ideas.

What kind of creative work will you do? We’re glad you asked. Because our work doesn’t really fit inside any kind of standard PR/Advertising/Communications/Marketing box, there’s no “standard” creative brief here. We’re the kind of creative department that works on scripts for a heartfelt brand anthem in the morning, switches over around lunchtime to concepting for a brand stunt that’ll hijack culture, and end our day by workshopping funny tweets. And that’s just a Monday. So, if you’re looking to come up with ideas that go beyond the 30-second spot – the kind of ideas that end up in the pages of the New York Times and on the One Show shortlist – you’ll be in good company here.

To land this gig, you need to have a passion for people and helping others solve problems. Our culture is what sets us apart from traditional ad agencies, and it’s why so many stay with us awhile. At Edelman, our most valuable resource is you – our people – with a diversity of backgrounds, ideas, and smarts (with heart). We support one another, encourage each other, and we’re looking for individuals who want to contribute to our culture. **In order to be considered for the role, you MUST present a digital portfolio with your application. No portfolios will not be considered!**

**About us**



Cedar was co-founded by Florian Otto and Arel Lidow in 2016 after a negative medical billing experience inspired them to help improve our healthcare system. With a commitment to solving billing and patient experience issues, Cedar has become a leading healthcare technology company fueled by remarkable growth. Over the past several years, we’ve raised more than $350 million in funding from investors such as Andreessen Horowitz and Tiger Global, bringing Cedar’s valuation to $3.2 billion.



As of December 2023, Cedar is engaging with 25 million patients on an annualized basis, and is on target to process $2.6 billion in patient payments annually. Cedar’s ambition is to serve 50-60 million Americans by 2025, about half of the U.S. population that makes medical payments annually. Cedar partners with more than 55 leading healthcare providers and payers including Highmark Inc., Allegheny Health Network, Novant Health, Allina Health and Providence.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Cedar-Inc-5","","","","","","","","",""

Description:


About The Saturday Program:


“If I can inspire one of these youngsters to develop the talent I know they possess, then my monument will be in their work.”– Augusta Savage


Founded in 1968, The Saturday Program is a Cooper Union pre-college program that provides free art education to underserved NYC public high school students. The program offers eight free classes each Saturday from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM during the school year on a semester by semester basis (October-December for Fall semester, January-April for Spring semester). Classes are led by current Cooper Union undergraduate Art and Architecture students on Cooper Union’s campus, allowing high schoolers to learn from near-peer mentors in a college environment. By offering art classes and additional program events and activities, The Saturday Program equips students with foundational skills traditionally found in exclusive art courses, as well as professional development and interpersonal experiences that foster motivation, confidence, and purpose. The Saturday Program plays a crucial role in supplementing the lack of arts education in NYC public and charter schools and promoting the participation of historically underserved communities in the arts.


The Saturday Program is designed to support the development of both “hard” technical art skills and “soft” interpersonal and professional skills in students. In preparing interested students to apply for art colleges, the program also aims to broaden participation and degree completion in the arts.

We are looking for a self-motivated, organized individual who is passionate about patient care and excited for the opportunity to independently manage their cases with confidence and accountability. As a Peritoneal Dialysis Registered Nurse (PD RN), you will be providing education on peritoneal dialysis to your patients and their care partners in a clinical setting, which then allows them to dialyze from home.


You have responsibility over the complete ongoing care of each patient to ensure their treatment stays on track.


Dialysis Experience is NOT required. Nephrology nursing provides a fresh lens and set of skills to those newly entering the field.

**What you can expect:**

* Provide comprehensive patient care in an independent setting.
	+ Apply your ""core"" nursing skills to assess, diagnose and implement complete care plans as you look at the whole patient. As a case manager, you will also track and organize your patients. With the pride of ownership comes the joy of witnessing how your care impacts patients' lives.
* Empower your patients by teaching them to administer their own dialysis and to take their health back into their own hands.
	+ Training patients takes time and mental energy and the rewards of that investment come in seeing the transformation of your patients from feeling sick and afraid, to strong, independent, and able to do the daily things that they love. Educating patients on their options when it comes to dialysis not only helps them own their journey, but also expands the program to people who will benefit greatly from PD.
* *Home RN partners to provide ongoing dialysis treatment education activities supporting the healthy growth of the home program. This includes educating new in-center hemodialysis patients in the clinics.*
* Lead, coach and guide with your nursing skills.
	+ You will work independently, while also building deep relationships with patients, support systems and care partners.

**Schedule**

* Typically, an 8-hour day, Monday through Friday with weekends and holidays off!
* Flexibility as you manage your own cases and as a result, own your own schedule.
* Scheduled home visits and on-call shifts vary by program and are compensated accordingly.

 **What we’ll provide:**

* Clear and competitive career growth for a lifetime nursing career.
* If you are new to dialysis, we’ll provide a 9-12 week paid-training and the support to guide you through to becoming a nephrology nurse.
* Annual $3,000 tuition reimbursement and potential $25,000 scholarship opportunity. CNN, CDN, and CPDN certification reimbursement. 100+ CEU courses at no-cost.
	+ Comprehensive benefits package: including medical, dental, vision, 401k match, family resources, pet insurance, mental health resources, back-up child and elder care and so much more.
	+ Our culture is filled with compassion, care and the desire to help our patients, our teammates and their families live their best life.

**Requirements:**

* Current Registered Nurse (RN) license in the state of practice
* Minimum of 12 months of RN experience
* Current driver's license, reliable transportation, and vehicle insurance in state of residence
* Associates Degree in Nursing (A.D.N) from accredited school of nursing required; Bachelor of Science in Nursing (B.S.N); three-year diploma from accredited diploma program may be substituted for nursing degree
* Basic computer skills and proficiency in MS Word and Outlook

**You might also have (a.k.a. nice-to-haves):**

* Previous Chronic Hemodialysis, Acute Dialysis, Home Hemodialysis (HHD) or Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) nursing experience

  

* Training/Teaching/Healthcare Education background
