Position Description



730 64th Street, Brooklyn, New York, 11220, United States of America


We are looking for a self-motivated, organized individual who is passionate about patient care and excited for the opportunity to independently manage their cases with confidence and accountability. As a Peritoneal Dialysis Registered Nurse (PD RN), you will be providing education on peritoneal dialysis to your patients and their care partners in a clinical setting, which then allows them to dialyze from home.


You have responsibility over the complete ongoing care of each patient to ensure their treatment stays on track.


Dialysis Experience is NOT required. Nephrology nursing provides a fresh lens and set of skills to those newly entering the field.


What you can expect:

* Provide comprehensive patient care in an independent setting.
	+ Apply your ""core"" nursing skills to assess, diagnose and implement complete care plans as you look at the whole patient. As a case manager, you will also track and organize your patients. With the pride of ownership comes the joy of witnessing how your care impacts patients' lives.
* Empower your patients by teaching them to administer their own dialysis and to take their health back into their own hands.
	+ Training patients takes time and mental energy and the rewards of that investment come in seeing the transformation of your patients from feeling sick and afraid, to strong, independent, and able to do the daily things that they love. Educating patients on their options when it comes to dialysis not only helps them own their journey, but also expands the program to people who will benefit greatly from PD.
	+ Home RN partners to provide ongoing dialysis treatment education activities supporting the healthy growth of the home program. This includes educating new in-center hemodialysis patients in the clinics.
* Lead, coach and guide with your nursing skills.
	+ You will work independently, while also building deep relationships with patients, support systems and care partners.

Schedule

* Typically, an 8-hour day, Monday through Friday with weekends and holidays off!
* Flexibility as you manage your own cases and as a result, own your own schedule.
* Scheduled home visits and on-call shifts vary by program and are compensated accordingly.


What we’ll provide:

* Clear and competitive career growth for a lifetime nursing career.
* If you are new to dialysis, we’ll provide a 9-12 week paid-training and the support to guide you through to becoming a nephrology nurse.
* Annual $3,000 tuition reimbursement and potential $25,000 scholarship opportunity. CNN, CDN, and CPDN certification reimbursement. 100+ CEU courses at no-cost.
* Comprehensive benefits package: including medical, dental, vision, 401k match, family resources, pet insurance, mental health resources, back-up child and elder care and so much more.
* Our culture is filled with compassion, care and the desire to help our patients, our teammates and their families live their best life.


Requirements:

* Current Registered Nurse (RN) license in the state of practice
* Minimum of 12 months of RN experience
* Current driver's license, reliable transportation, and vehicle insurance in state of residence
* Associates Degree in Nursing (A.D.N) from accredited school of nursing required; Bachelor of Science in Nursing (B.S.N); three-year diploma from accredited diploma program may be substituted for nursing degree
* Basic computer skills and proficiency in MS Word and Outlook


You might also have (a.k.a. nice-to-haves):

* Previous Chronic Hemodialysis, Acute Dialysis, Home Hemodialysis (HHD) or Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) nursing experience
* Training/Teaching/Healthcare Education background
* Previous case management experience
* Familiarity with, or excitement to learn about telehealth technologies
* Certified Nephrology Nurse (CNN), Certified Dialysis Nurse (CDN), Certified Peritoneal Dialysis Nurse (CPDN)
