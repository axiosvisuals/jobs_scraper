IPG's first and only consulting led business, Black Glass is an agile marketing consultancy, delivering practical, easy to implement strategic guidance that will have rapid, evident, effective and efficient impact on companies, their brands, and customers. Powered by the world's largest source of customer data, we turn consumer needs into commercial outcomes, through a process we call Radical ClarityTM that works at the speed of the consumer to increase growth, reduce costs, and actualize results.



Our process includes using data from IPG's data hub Acxiom and other sources and using financial modeling to develop frameworks with accuracy and practicality for every stage of goals and growth.



We are seeking a highly organized and adaptable individual to join our team as a business coordinator and accelerant to our powerhouse team. This unique role combines the responsibilities of a entry/junior-level ""Chief of Staff"" with the responsibilities of an early career consultant. As this individual and business grows, it will move into a 100% client facing role.



This is an incredible opportunity for someone looking to extend your capabilities in a formal Marketing Strategy role in a dynamic learning environment. We are a small team, and this individual would be a critical hire to enable four senior leaders. This role has direct access to all clients, projects and leaders.


**Black Glass Values**


**PARTNERSHIP even at the expense of individual success**



We expect partnership at Black Glass, between folks on the team, and with our customers. That means getting to know the whole person, meeting them where they are, and helping them be their best. So when in doubt, reach out and connect – and don't spend too long in your own world. Moving fast is great, but do it with a partner, please. Finally: because our default setting is having each others' backs when we fall, don't be afraid to leap.


**IMPACT even at the expense of our scope of work**



Revenue and profit are short-term indicators of the change we're trying to make in the world, and while they're important, they're only proxies. We're obsessed with making a positive impact on the world around us through our customers – so leave each interaction, each project, each relationship better than the way you found it, even if that means calling out the hard thing to discuss, and calling folks in to participate.


**INTENSITY even at the expense of ""always on""**



While we admire intensity in all its forms, from deep strengths to strong entrepreneurial drive, we also know that highs come with lows, and sprints are followed by rest. We do not expect everyone to be good at everything – we're seeking greatness in a few, critical areas. We do not expect everyone to be ""always on"" – we're looking for fire when people *are* on. We do not expect to do everything well – we expect surprising levels of awesomeness in the things we choose to do well (yes, even the ""boring"" stuff). Make it great, or don't do it at all.
