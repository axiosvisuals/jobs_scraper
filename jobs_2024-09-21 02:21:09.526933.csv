Lyra Technology Group is looking for a sales leader to step in and grow one of their operating companies.


**A bit about Lyra…**


Lyra Technology Group (http://www.lyratechgroup.com/) is a family of industry leading technology service businesses. Our companies are operated independently by exceptional management teams. Companies that join our group retain the employees, name, and culture that have made them successful. As a platform of Evergreen Services Group (http://www.evergreensg.com/), we never divest from businesses we partner with and approach every decision with the goal of driving sustainable and healthy growth over the long term.


We made our first acquisition at the beginning of 2018. Today, we hold a controlling stake in 70 companies across the US, UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. Our companies employ over 6000 team members, each led by its own management team.


What sets us apart are three things: our buy and hold strategy, our company's local autonomous management, and our scale.


1. Unlike typical Private Equity investments with a three-to-five-year liquidation strategy, we buy businesses and invest in them for the long-term. We believe in the value of our acquisitions and want to grow.

  

2. We bought our companies because they already had success in the marketplace. Instead of asking them to conform to a unified platform, we allow companies to keep their team, culture and branding in place.


3. We enjoy the best of both worlds, small company culture and big business resources. We leverage our collective scale for strategic partnerships, shared resources, and buying power.


**Your work as the Growth Leader includes several components:**  

  

* **Professionalizing the sales function**- Build out structure, sales process, tooling, comp plans, BDR teams, marketing, metrics, and playbooks.
* **P****layer / coach**- Leverage your network and sales skills to hunt and close deals as a player. As you succeed in driving sales, start building out a sales team that you will manage.
* **R****un cross-functional growth campaigns**- Your primary objective is driving new logo sales growth. However, we believe sales, account management, marketing, and operations should work together. You will be expected to run cross-functional growth campaigns.
* **Business partner to the CEO**- The sales leader of the organization should be the CEO's right-hand person. Formulate overall business strategy and execute.
* **Managed Service Provider Sales experience**- Previous experience selling in an MSP environment is preferred.

  

In addition, you will also have an opportunity to work closely with, learn from, and share perspectives with the group of peer sales leaders across our businesses. Your community will include ambitious professionals building world-class sales organizations.  

  

We are looking for smart, motivated leaders who are looking to “roll up their sleeves” and hungry to make an impact by building a sustainable organic growth model. We offer exceptional people the opportunity to meaningfully accelerate their career trajectory.
