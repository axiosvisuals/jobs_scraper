The Center for Justice Innovation is a community justice organization that centers safety and racial justice. Since our founding in 1996, the Center has partnered with community members, courts, and the people most impacted to create stronger, healthier, more just communities. Our decades of experience in courts and communities, coupled with our field-leading research and practitioner expertise, help us drive justice nationwide in innovative, powerful, and durable ways. For more information on how and where we work, please visit www.innovatingjustice.org.


The Center is a 900-employee, $100 million nonprofit that accomplishes its vision through three pillars of work: creating and scaling operating programs to test new ideas and solve problems, performing original research to determine what works (and what doesn’t), and providing expert assistance and policy guidance to justice reformers around the world.

**Operating Programs**


The Center’s operating programs, including the award-winning Red Hook Community Justice Center and Midtown Community Justice Center, test new ideas, solve difficult problems, and attempt to achieve systemic change within the justice system. Our projects include community-based violence prevention programs, alternatives to incarceration, reentry initiatives, and court-based initiatives that reduce the use of unnecessary incarceration and promote positive individual and family change. Through this programming, we have produced tangible results like safer streets, reduced incarceration, and improved neighborhood perceptions of justice.

**Research**


The Center's research teams are staffed with social scientists, data analysts, and lawyers who are academically-trained or have lived experience and who conduct research in the U.S. and globally on diverse criminal-legal system and justice issues. Their work includes evaluating programs and policies; conducting exploratory, community-based studies; and providing research translation and strategic planning for system actors. The Center has published studies on topics including court and jail reform, intimate partner violence, restorative justice, gun violence, reentry, sixth amendment rights, and progressive prosecution. The research teams strive to make their work meaningful and actionable to the communities they work with, policymakers, and practitioners.

**Policy & Expert Assistance**


The Center provides hands-on, planning and implementation assistance to a wide range of jurisdictions in areas of reform such as problem-solving courts (e.g., community courts, treatment courts, domestic violence courts), tribal justice, reducing incarceration and the use of fines/fees and reducing crime and violence. Our current expert assistance takes many forms, including help with analyzing data, strategic planning and consultation, policy guidance, and hosting site visits to its operating programs in the New York City area.

**Center Support**


A dedicated support team within the Center ensures the smooth functioning of operations across various domains, including finance, legal, technology, human resources, fundraising, real estate, and communications. Comprising 15% of the organization's staff, these teams provide essential infrastructure support and innovative solutions aligned with the Center's mission and values.

**THE OPPORTUNITY**


Brooklyn Justice Initiatives (BJI), the largest operating project of the Center, seeks to re-engineer the experience of criminal court in Brooklyn, New York, by providing judges and attorneys meaningful alternatives to bail, fines, and jail sentences. Operating out of Kings County Criminal Court and community-based offices, BJI is a team of social service providers, court-based resource coordinators, mental health practitioners, compliance specialists, and others who seek to improve the quality of justice. Supervised Release offers an alternative to jail by providing pretrial supervision, case management, and voluntary social services to people charged with misdemeanor and felony offenses, and in doing so, uses an arrest as a window of opportunity to change the direction of a participant’s life, avoiding the harmful effects of incarceration. Program participants are monitored to ensure their appearance at court dates and mandatory programming, and receive referrals to services like job training, drug treatment, and mental health counseling.


BJI seeks Clinical Intake Specialists for the borough’s Supervised Release Program (SRP). Reporting to the Clinical Intake Coordinator, Clinical Intake Specialists will leverage social work or mental health training and direct practice experience to facilitate participants’ successful transition into SRP. Clinical Intake Specialists will conduct a comprehensive needs assessment; connect participants with an appropriate case manager, focusing on participant needs and individual case manager skills and strengths; generate mandatory programming recommendations, and refer candidates to services with community-based service providers. Additionally, this position will provide de-escalation and emergency intervention within the courthouse, as needed. This position provides hours towards LCSW accreditation.


Clinical Intake Specialists are responsible for effective cross-team communication and collaboration to prioritize comprehensive and aligned service delivery; proactively identifying successes, challenges, and opportunities to strengthen programming; create opportunities for meaningful collaboration, and maximize the use of internal and external resources and expertise.

“Sport has the power to change the world. It has the power to inspire, it has the power to unite people in a way that little else does. It speaks to youth in a language they understand. Sport can create hope, where once there was only despair. It is more powerful than governments in breaking down racial barriers. It laughs in the face of all types of discrimination.” – Nelson Mandela, Laureus World Sports Awards, 2000.  

Laureus Sport for Good USA (“Laureus USA”) is a nonprofit, grant-making organization with a mission to improve the lives of youth and unite communities through the power of sport. Since 2012, Laureus USA has impacted the lives of over one million youth through investing $30 million in sports-based youth development organizations around the country. The grants set out to unleash the power of sport to enhance physical and mental health, improve educational and employment outcomes, and address critical social justice issues.  

Laureus USA undertakes the work of the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation in the US, alongside 7 other National Foundations, as well as other Laureus initiatives including Laureus World Sports Academy, Laureus Ambassadors, and the Laureus World Sports Awards. Globally, the organization has invested more than $250m into the Sport for Development sector, which has helped change the lives of more than 7 million children and young people.  

Laureus Sport for Good Foundation was conceived and founded by Richemont. Laureus USA, while an independent organization, maintains a resource sharing agreement with Richemont North America (RNA). RNA provides basic operational services to Laureus USA, including Human Resources, Information Technology, Building and Office Services, and Travel. **Vision (the goal that our founding belief challenges us to achieve)**

easyplant is a self-watering plant system that makes it easy to fill your home with amazing plants and keep them alive by only watering them once a month! In 2016, our Founders (two best friends) started working on a simple idea: how could we make it super easy for people to decorate and beautify their homes? We realized that people love decorating with houseplants, but they are one of the worst-designed decor products ever (they die constantly!), so we turned our attention there and called in our best engineers to figure out how to prevent plants from dying. In 2021, easyplant was born - an amazing self-watering plant system that makes it easy for anyone to be a plant parent!

Our e-commerce customers went crazy for easy plant, so we knew it was time to bring our amazing products to retail so that people could experience our beautiful plants and the special pots that make easyplant work! We envision a world in which everyone feels empowered to bring the beauty and benefits of nature into their homes without the guesswork of how to keep their plants alive. If you’re excited by this, please join us on our mission to bring plants to all.

**Why Work at Easyplant?**

At easyplant, we love what we do, and we love people who love what *they* do. As a company we value sincerity, authenticity and being joyfully customer centric.

* Own all back-of-house processes and operations and iterate them as necessary to optimize inventory shipments and keep plants neat, organized and healthy.

**Organization Overview:**


The Fortune Society, Inc. (Fortune) has been working for over 54 years in service to our mission: to support successful reentry from incarceration and promote alternatives to incarceration, thus strengthening the fabric of our communities. The organization has evolved into one of the nations preeminent reentry and justice-informed service organizations, providing formerly-incarcerated people with the skills and wrap-around services needed to break the cycle of crime and incarceration and to build productive lives in their communities.


Fortune has grown steadily over the years to an agency just under $60 million in annual budget with just under 600 staff. We anticipate that we will keep growing, both in size and in depth of service. Fortune has a dual mission: both advocacy and service. The advocacy portion of our mission focuses on building a more just criminal legal system and reducing the barriers to reentry into society. The service side of Fortune has evolved to encompass a broad range of programs that started with employment and education and now includes a robust array of services, among them: alternatives to incarceration, supervised release, court advocacy, discharge planning within correctional facilities, licensed substance use and mental health treatment, a housing continuum ranging from emergency and transitional through permanent congregate and scattered site housing, assistance in obtaining benefits, a care management unit, HIV services, a food and nutrition program, and an arts program. Each service we provide is informed by the needs of the population we serve. Fortune currently serves approximately 11,000 people a year. Our client population mirrors the incarcerated population in being approximately 85% male and over 90% people of color. Our program models are recognized, both nationally and internationally, for their quality and innovation.
