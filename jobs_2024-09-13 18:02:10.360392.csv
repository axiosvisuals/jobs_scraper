The Center for Justice Innovation is a community justice organization that centers safety and racial justice. Since our founding in 1996, the Center has partnered with community members, courts, and the people most impacted to create stronger, healthier, more just communities. Our decades of experience in courts and communities, coupled with our field-leading research and practitioner expertise, help us drive justice nationwide in innovative, powerful, and durable ways. For more information on how and where we work, please visit www.innovatingjustice.org.


The Center is a 900-employee, $100 million nonprofit that accomplishes its vision through three pillars of work: creating and scaling operating programs to test new ideas and solve problems, performing original research to determine what works (and what doesn’t), and providing expert assistance and policy guidance to justice reformers around the world.

**Operating Programs**


The Center’s operating programs, including the award-winning Red Hook Community Justice Center and Midtown Community Justice Center, test new ideas, solve difficult problems, and attempt to achieve systemic change within the justice system. Our projects include community-based violence prevention programs, alternatives to incarceration, reentry initiatives, and court-based initiatives that reduce the use of unnecessary incarceration and promote positive individual and family change. Through this programming, we have produced tangible results like safer streets, reduced incarceration, and improved neighborhood perceptions of justice.

**Research**


The Center's research teams are staffed with social scientists, data analysts, and lawyers who are academically-trained or have lived experience and who conduct research in the U.S. and globally on diverse criminal-legal system and justice issues. Their work includes evaluating programs and policies; conducting exploratory, community-based studies; and providing research translation and strategic planning for system actors. The Center has published studies on topics including court and jail reform, intimate partner violence, restorative justice, gun violence, reentry, sixth amendment rights, and progressive prosecution. The research teams strive to make their work meaningful and actionable to the communities they work with, policymakers, and practitioners.

**Policy & Expert Assistance**


The Center provides hands-on, planning and implementation assistance to a wide range of jurisdictions in areas of reform such as problem-solving courts (e.g., community courts, treatment courts, domestic violence courts), tribal justice, reducing incarceration and the use of fines/fees and reducing crime and violence. Our current expert assistance takes many forms, including help with analyzing data, strategic planning and consultation, policy guidance, and hosting site visits to its operating programs in the New York City area.

**Center Support**


A dedicated support team within the Center ensures the smooth functioning of operations across various domains, including finance, legal, technology, human resources, fundraising, real estate, and communications. Comprising 15% of the organization's staff, these teams provide essential infrastructure support and innovative solutions aligned with the Center's mission and values.

**THE OPPORTUNITY**


The Center for Justice Innovation is seeking an experienced Clinical Director of Brooklyn Felony Diversion. Reporting to the Project Director, the Clinical Director will oversee all clinical services, staff, and programming for two Center programs that offer diversion in Kings County Supreme Court: Brooklyn Mental Health Court and the Brooklyn Felony Alternatives-to-Incarceration program. These programs work to reduce the use of incarceration and address an array of participant needs, including around complex mental health, substance use, employment, and housing. Clinicians and other onsite staff conduct independent assessments, prepare recommendations for programming and supervision, provide referrals to community-based providers, offer ongoing case management, supervision and compliance monitoring, and pilot new services.  

  

**Brooklyn Mental Health Court**  

The Brooklyn Mental Health Court launched in 2002 as NYC’s first mental health court, serving individuals charged primarily with felony offenses who are living with serious mental illness. The program diverts participants from jail or prison by conducting clinical assessments and then connecting them with long-term treatment in the community, along with rigorous judicial monitoring. The court aims to strengthen the justice system’s ability to identify, assess, and monitor individual participants, to create linkages between the justice and mental health systems, and to improve public safety by ensuring that participants receive high quality community-based services.  

  

**Brooklyn Felony ATI Program**  

The Brooklyn Felony ATI Program utilizes a similar model to Brooklyn Mental Health Court, serving individuals facing felony charges who are not otherwise eligible for Mental Health Court or other treatment courts in Brooklyn. The program receives referrals through two pathways: (1) the dedicated Felony ATI court part within Brooklyn Supreme Court, with a dedicated judge and supervising prosecutor; and (2) through other court parts throughout Brooklyn Criminal and Supreme Court. Regardless of the referral pathway, all participants receive individualized assessments, onsite and community-based services, compliance monitoring and judicial monitoring for the life of the case.

**Responsibilities include but are not limited to:*** Manage clinical and case management staff as they: assess potential participants; provide referrals to community-based service providers; and monitor and report on compliance for court mandated participants;
* Supervise a team of social workers and case managers working within the Brooklyn Mental Health Court and the Felony ATI program, including providing clinical supervision to social work staff;

Important Information
FINRA’s Code of Conduct imposes restrictions on employees’ investments and requires financial disclosures that are uniquely related to our role as a securities regulator. FINRA employees are required to disclose to FINRA all brokerage accounts that they maintain, and those in which they control trading or have a financial interest (including any trust account of which they are a trustee or beneficiary and all accounts of a spouse, domestic partner or minor child who lives with the employee) and to authorize their broker-dealers to provide FINRA with duplicate statements for all of those accounts. All of those accounts are subject to the Code’s investment and securities account restrictions, and new employees must comply with those investment restrictions—including disposing of any security issued by a company on FINRA’s Prohibited Company List or obtaining a written waiver from their Executive Vice President—by the date they begin employment with FINRA. Employees may only maintain securities accounts that must be disclosed to FINRA at one or more securities firms that provide an electronic feed (e-feed) of data to FINRA, and must move securities accounts from other securities firms to a firm that provides an e-feed within three months of beginning employment.

**WHO WE ARE:**  

  

The Rainforest Alliance is creating a more sustainable world by using social and market forces to protect nature and improve the lives of farmers and forest communities. To achieve our mission, we partner with diverse allies around the world to drive positive change across global supply chains and in many of our most critically important natural landscapes.  

  

Our alliance spans 70 countries and includes farmers and forest communities, companies, governments, civil society, and millions of individuals. Together we work to protect forests and biodiversity, take action on climate, and promote the rights and improve the livelihoods of rural people.  

  

As an international nonprofit organization with more than 30 years of experience in sustainability transformation, we understand that the social and economic well-being of rural communities is tightly connected to ecosystem health. This knowledge has shaped our rigorous programs to advance sustainable land-use and commodity production.  

  

At the Rainforest Alliance we combat climate change, protect forests and biodiversity, promote human rights, and improve livelihoods. The enormity of the social and environmental challenges we are facing requires working together in a broad alliance. This is why we bring farmers, forest communities, companies, and consumers together to change the way the world produces, sources, and consumes.  

  

**Why**  

To protect nature and improve lives it’s becoming increasingly urgent that we approach the way we use our land and produce food and other products in more sustainable ways. For this to succeed we need to fundamentally change the way that businesses operate and source, and the choices we all make as consumers.  

  

**How**  

Our growing global alliance aims to transform our relationship with our natural resources and each other, to create a better future for people and nature together.  

  

**The Rainforest Alliance encourages diversity and inclusion across the global organization. With this commitment to diversity, we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer and do not discriminate on the basis of gender, race, color, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, ages, disability, and any other protected group.**","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Rainforest-Alliance-3","","","","","","","","",""

---------------------

  

Within *Credit Portfolio & Resource Management (CPRM)* the *Strategic Allocation and Optimization (SAO)* group is responsible for leading all aspects of optimization of resources for the balance sheet assets under the CPRM scope (Real Assets, elements of Global Trade, ASF, Corporates Financing) and ultimately for coordinating and expressing CPRM’s view on Resource Allocation and Active Portfolio Management:

  



* RWAs: Optimization transactions, SRT, Capital Relief
* Risk management: secondary sales, credit insurance (portfolio and line-by-line), portfolio transactions
* Hedging: credit hedging, identification and execution of additional opportunities (IR, FX)
* Funding: liquidity raising for the CIB
* Structured Distribution (e.g. CLOs) and Distribute-to-Originate
* Portfolio relative value and indicative pricing

  

It is also the lead on special projects involving the balance sheet management and optimization.

  



In the Americas platform, the SAO team consists of two full time employees. This description is for the head of the team (director/e.d. - level) who will work in close coordination with the SAO team in London.

  



Working with CPRM ExCo, drawing on input from Transverse Portfolio teams (Insight & Analytics), the Portfolio Management, Origination and GM teams, focus on the key missions of the SAO:

  



**Optimization**


* Identify portfolio active management options for capital efficiency objectives (optimization, de-risking, limit & concentration management) in cooperation with Global Markets teams for execution (Structuring, Sales, Trading, Syndication), both at line by line and portfolio level : secondary sales, insurance, CDS, synthetic risk transfer solutions, repack…
* Analyze the pros and cons of each hedging solution depending on their impact (metrics, maneuverability e.g. requested alignment). Identify the optimal ones depending on the portfolios (e.g. relational/transactional, sector, geography) and targeted objective.
* Make a recommendation on the recommended active portfolio strategy, to be reviewed regularly and at least monthly
* Manage the existing portfolio of SRTs and other optimization solutions (insurance)
* Coordinate the development of new optimization solutions in the post-Basel3 regulatory environment
* Re-think and improve the processes around Credit Insurance (coordination, risk appetite, liquidity impact, portability & repackaging, long-term agreements)

  

**Market Access**


* Secondary sales:
	+ Review the portfolio with PM and Origination teams for Sales opportunities (de-concentration, risk management, optimization) down to ORE
	+ Steer the axe sheet and its execution from a portfolio standpoint (prioritization, coordination of execution in partnership with GM teams and PM team)
	+ Increase the tactical approach (anticipation of market trends)
	+ Follow up execution and ensure timely feedbacks to investors together with PM team and good coordination with borrowers/insurers, smooth communication across the chain and client expectation management
	+ Contribute to deliver secondary sales budget and objectives jointly with PM team
* Increase market intelligence by exchanging with market peers and GM Teams
* Foster the global portfolio angle to contribute to cross platforms trades (line by line or structured solutions)
* Establish a methodology to track relative value between the asset classes in the portfolio. Ultimately, derive a transverse risk-appetite at the CPRM level to complement the individual business line risk appetite.

  

**Distribution**


* Develop new avenues of distribution for the CIB (Funds, Structured Distribution e.g. CLOs) in coordination with Business Line origination and GM teams when needed
* Use this market intelligence to drive the Portfolio’s risk appetite and support Distribution-driven origination
* Act as the project coordinator and the “client” of the internal structuring and syndication functions
* Review existing approaches and challenge if appropriate (insurance, partnerships, participations).

**Funding**


* Explore repackaging opportunities based on CIB’s assets to raise additional liquidity (repos, secured financing, participations, repackaging)
* Lead discussions on behalf of the portfolio on transfer pricing of the liquidity raised
* Establish relationships with potential counterparties, via GM/GSF and if needed independently
* With the Portfolio Insights team, contribute to the monitoring of the encumberment of the assets for various structures and across all dimensions (pledges, green assets, replenishment opportunities etc.)

  

**Special Projects**


* Contribute to ad hoc special projects for CPRM e.g. risk analysis, credit stress testing, tools and system design, new initiatives and portfolio reviews
* Lead Quarterly Portfolio Reviews in coordination with Origination and Portfolio Management
* Coordinate with Chamonix the structuring and execution of structured trades with Chamonix Partners, alongside the Head of Distribution for Real Assets.
* Aim to integrate as many of the missions as possible into the digitalization agenda of the Financing Chain

  

**How we work**


* As part of a small team, demonstrate an ability to work across siloes in good understanding and to foster cooperation
* Expect to be involved on projects with various CPRM ExCo members
* Be a collegiate leader/ambassador within CPRM: onboard, recruit help, Sinvolve, educate and inspire colleagues from other CPRM teams into your projects
* Be a coordinator of CIB resources and expertise in other divisions to achieve your objectives (Banking Business Lines, GM structuring, syndication, distribution)
