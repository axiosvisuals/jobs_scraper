The programs are fun, instructional and non-competitive.

We have openings for new coaches in the western part of Morris County for our upcoming Fall season. We'll be holding our program in over 150 locations throughout NJ and we have averaged approx. 5,000 children in prior years. So there is plenty of work to be had for the right person.

Our typical coach works about 4-5 hours per week. This is a great job for someone looking for some part-time work to schedule around their school hours or any other part-time or full-time job(s) they may have. In the past, the following types of people have worked out very well for us:

* College students
* Graduate school students
* Teachers looking to make some additional income after school hours (3:00 to 5:00) and/or weekend mornings
* People working multiple part-time positions.
* People who are currently unemployed and conducting a job search for a full-time position.
* Soccer coaches who train club teams, but are looking for additional work on weekday mornings and early afternoons (before their club team training sessions)

A potential candidate will have experience in both organized sports (playing, coaching, etc.) and working with children in a group setting (teaching, coaching, camp counseling, etc.). Most importantly, they will have the right personality and demeanor to work with young children. By this, we mean that they are energetic, upbeat, charismatic and the type of person that can captivate a group of 3 to 5-yr. olds for a 1-hour soccer session. While a background in soccer is preferred, if you don't have that, but have participated in other organized sports, that can work as well.

Interested candidates should include a cover letter with their resume listing ALL of the following. If you don't provide ALL of the information requested, you will not be viewed as a serious candidate.

* Experience in soccer (and/or other competitive sports).

At KFC, we feed the world. But we do more than fill people up. We fulfill their life. Our meals matter, and when we serve them with southern hospitality, we make our customer's day. So our jobs are more than a paycheck - they're about being independent, having fun, and making new friends.  

  

As a Team Member, you could be the smiling face that greets and serves customers. Or you could be the cook that prepares our world famous chicken (and tell your friends you know the ""secret"" - just kiddin'). Whatever job you do, you know what you do matters - to your team and to your customers.  

  

**Requirements:**  

  

The good news is that your training will teach you everything you need to know to succeed on the job. But there are a few skills you should have from the get-go:  

  

* You're a fun and friendly person who values customers and takes absolute pride in everything you do.


- You like talking - a lot - even to strangers (despite what your Mom told you). This is important, because you're not able to text message customers.
  

- You've got attitude - the right kind of course - and understand the need to be on time, all the time. With loads of energy, you understand that work is easier - and more fun - working as a team.  

* And you're at least 16 years old.

  

Keep in mind, this is just basic information. You'll find out more after you apply. And independently-owned franchised or licensed locations may have different requirements.
