Dates and times TBD but it is likely to be one afternoon a week from roughly 3pm-5pm. The program will include painting miniatures, creating tabletop sets/scenarios, and playing games and tournaments. We can try to use Games Workshop’s Warhammer Alliance curriculum, materials, and schedule of activities but more than likely you will need to create your own agenda of activities and games. You should be interested in helping plan this course to include community service, leadership skills, and personal growth/development.

A tentative description of the program is below (note that while the school is excited about having a tabletop gaming club and knows that we will be playing Warhammer, they do not want us to call it “Warhammer Alliance” or “Kill Team” or “War Cry” etc. because the school administration does not want to emphasize anything war-centric or violent. That said, we’ll be playing some form of Warhammer and painting those miniatures. You’ll see in the course description below that we also intend to include service leadership skills and community service in the course.

**Vanguard Alliance Tabletop Gaming Club (Grades 5-8)** 

Join the Vanguard Alliance and charge into the world’s greatest tabletop strategic miniatures game that combines teamwork, creative arts, battle tactics, and 3D printing, all through hands-on, unplugged play. We’ll build, assemble, and paint our miniatures, tabletop terrain, and adventure campaigns as a team and compete in mini-tournaments with awards for painting, playing, 3D design, written lore, and community leadership. We’ll align the values we stand for in real life to our in-game heroes as we plan and deliver service learning projects that foster empathy, leadership, and social entrepreneurship. We’ll start by creating our chapter’s own unique values and principles–starting with Integrity, Teamwork, and Creativity–and then stand up for those values despite all odds. Every session brings a new challenge. Will we hold fast against the Necron Warriors, who prize profit above people and the planet? Will we face our fears and stand together against the Kruleboyz, who seek to divide and conquer as they burn through the planet’s resources? Your adventure starts with a choice: Will you stand up with your fellow warriors and fight for humanity and the future of planet Terra? Our future depends on you!

**Skills Learned**: imagination, engineering design, math, art, critical thinking, reading and creative writing, advanced model-making, computer-aided design (CAD), 3D printing, game design, as well as life skills in social-emotional and executive functioning, problem-solving, critical thinking, leadership, and community service

Our team creates **positive change** in the lives of others by helping people feel better in the comfort of their own home. Our nurses provide relief to those suffering from cold/flu-like symptoms, nausea and vomiting, migraines, fatigue, hangovers, and so much more. If making a meaningful impact by helping others is your career goal, we’d love to talk with you!

Being that this position is completely mobile, the ideal candidate will enjoy traveling to client locations, possess expert IV skills, keen assessment skills, excellent bedside manner, and have a zealous drive to get out there and treat as many patients as possible while making great money in the process! Nurses will function as independent contractors (1099/W9) and make a percentage of each call they complete plus tips (we are a concierge service, so we accept tips!). Although you are functioning as an independent contractor, this is not like a travel or temporary assignment, we want our amazing nurses to stay for the long-run!

We are looking for nurses available a minimum of 2-3 days per week. During your ""on call days"" you are simply made available. The patient selects their service online from our menu of fluids, vitamins, and add-ins but of course once you arrive to the patient, treatment is always customizable based off their needs. You will be provided with training and resources in order to provide the absolute best care for our patients using our protocols established by our Medical Director.

Being a 1099 independent contractor, supplies are your financial responsibility, however, this provides you with tax write-offs, other self-employment benefits, and great pay! We will set you up directly with our contracted medical vendors where you will receive the best pricing in the industry for supplies. Not only does this role provide lucrative pay but it provides the ability for autonomy and freedom to have a great work-life balance!
