VOICE Charter School (http://www.voicecharterschool.org/) is an elementary and middle school located in Long Island City, Queens that serves about 650 students across grades K-8. We are located just minutes from Manhattan (two stops outside of Manhattan on the F, N, and W train lines) and Long Island City’s growing waterfront district, thriving arts community, and rapid residential growth. We are looking to identify extraordinary educators and administrators committed to urban education who wish to join a dynamic professional learning community.

Our mission is to create a safe and healthy learning environment that will nurture, motivate and challenge all of our children to achieve the highest level of academic excellence and to develop into mindful, responsible, contributing participants in their education, their community and the diverse society in which we live.

***What makes VOICE different?***

**At VOICE, it’s not just about the music. It’s about the people.** It’s about what you can be. It’s about using your passion. It’s about relationships. It’s about having the opportunity to choose. It’s about caring enough. It’s about each individual child and adult.

**We believe in efficacy.** At the core of our academic culture is the idea that all students are capable of doing well in any discipline. At VOICE, all students will learn – being smart is not something that you are, it is something you become. At VOICE, you will be pushed to become more.

**We support and develop the effectiveness of our teachers.** We believe that teachers need time to collaborate to build their practice, so we provide our team with over two hours of planning time a day as well as additional days for collaborative thought partnership and planning during the school year.

**We promote participation in music and the arts.** As music and art help develop problem solving and critical thinking skills and open children's imaginations, all VOICE students participate in and learn from daily activities in the arts including rigorous choral training. We design our arts-integrated curriculum to bring joy and wonder to the lives of our children, providing them with the skills necessary to forge their own path.

***All Staff at VOICE:***

**Who We Are**



East Harlem Scholars Academies are community-based Pre-K to 12 public charter schools operated by East Harlem Tutorial Program (EHTP). EHTP began in 1958 as a children's reading group and has since grown into a multi-site after-school program for traditional public school students and a network of public charter schools focused on significantly increasing the college graduation rate in East Harlem. We are on track to serve at least 25% of East Harlem students by 2025, with enrollment for this year at approximately 2200 students in our schools and after school programs. In 2020, 99% of our seniors were accepted to college, and our current scholars in college are on-track to graduate at eight times the national average of their peers.



At EHTP we also aim to serve as an agent of change and thoughtfully contribute to the national fight for racial equity. Through our organization-wide commitment to anti-racism work, we prepare our scholars to effect change, challenge the status quo, and thrive in the world around them. As staff members, we face our own racial identities and conscious and unconscious biases. With this in mind, all of our professional development, curriculum, organizational materials, and processes are designed with a goal of racial justice. Read our racial equity statement **here**.



We ground all of our work in racial equity, **in our core values**, and in our four guiding pursuits: the Revolutionary Pursuit of Love, the Radical Pursuit of Knowledge, the Responsive Pursuit of Healing, and in the Relentless Pursuit of Results. These pursuits inform and are reflected in our current four key strategic priorities: to increase high-impact, high-quality academic curriculum, programming content, staff capacity, and coaching; to embrace and advance our use of technology; to deepen our embodiment of ethical and equitable radical humanity; and to efficiently operationalize teaching, learning, community, and care.

Buddy Web Design & Development is a growing, entrepreneurial, and award-winning website design and development company headquartered in the Grand Rapids, Michigan area. Buddy has built a portfolio of clients across the United States, and is currently seeking help to grow the business by identifying and helping to secure new client projects.

Buddy is seeking an independent contractor who can spearhead sales and, in particular, lead-generation activities, including prospecting, outreach, and qualifying new sales leads. This work can be done remotely and part time, according to a schedule of your choosing.

While Buddy has traditionally offered high-quality website design and development and graphic design services for small- and mid-sized clients across a variety of industries, we're excited to add some additional new services and targeted opportunities this year. In particular, Buddy is adding to its service offering ongoing website support and maintenance plans, as well as ""all-in-one"" plans where Buddy designs, builds, and launches a new website for clients, and then takes care of ongoing hosting, maintenance, monitoring, updates, and edit requests, all for a low monthly fee, rather than the more traditional ""lump sum"" payment structure. We are excited about both these maintenance and all-in-one packages opening the doors to new prospective clients.

Further, Buddy is launching more targeted marketing efforts for these all-in-one plans, focusing initially on blue collar trades (buddywdd.com/tr) and healthcare practices (buddywdd.com/hc).

We're excited to partner with an experienced sales individual to help champion sales efforts for these new initiatives. An ideal person for this opportunity will have an entrepreneurial mindset, friendly and outgoing personality, and high degree of professionalism and integrity, coupled with a comfort and willingness to identify and reach out to prospective clients and build mutually beneficial relationships.

5+ years of business-to-business sales experience and a record of success is required, particularly in a sales role where you were required to generate your own leads, rather than working off a provided sales prospect list or via inbound leads.

Please note that this role is structured as an independent contractor opportunity, with compensation structured as commission only.

If this sounds interesting to you, and you’re excited to help grow an entrepreneurial business providing an in-demand technology service, please apply here.

NOTE: When applying, please be sure to share your experience regarding sales and lead generation in the accompanying screening questions, as well as affirming that you understand that this is a commission-based, independent contractor role. Applicants without responses to these questions will not be considered.

Learn more about Buddy by visiting www.BuddyWDD.com.
