StaffCo is a Professional Employer Organization, commonly referred to as a PEO, duly organized and registered under the New York Professional Employer Organization law. StaffCo and SUNY have entered into a professional employer agreement under which StaffCo is the employer of Stony Brook Clinical Practice Management Plan employees and responsible for all aspects of employment, including hirings, promotions, disciplines, terminations, the day-to-day direction and supervision of work, as well as labor relations and collective bargaining. StaffCo is fully responsible for providing all payroll and human resources services, including the payment of wages, collecting and reporting payroll taxes and maintaining any and all employee benefits. SUNY Stony Brook Hospital is responsible for the operation of the hospital and provision of health care and is the co-employer as is necessary to conduct its responsibilities and for related licensure, regulatory or statutory requirements and obligations.

  

Given StaffCo’s employment responsibilities, it is deemed the “employer” for employment and labor law purposes. Thus, the employees are private sector employees of StaffCo, not public sector employees of SUNY. The private sector nature of the StaffCo employees has been approved by NYS Civil Service and upheld in a decision by the US National Labor Relations Board.

About Clarks
  
Clarks, based in Somerset, England, has been at the forefront of innovative shoemaking since its foundation in 1825, when brothers James and Cyrus Clark made a slipper from sheepskin off-cuts. At the time it was ground-breaking: a combination of invention and craftsmanship that has remained at the heart of what the brand does now. In the Clarks archive of more than 22,000 pairs are shoes that have sparked revolutions and defined generations. From the original Clarks Desert Boot, first designed by Nathan Clark and launched in 1950, to the iconic Wallabee, each design has an instantly recognizable signature that makes it unmistakably Clarks.
  
**This season, we’re proud to introduce the Clarks Collective:** five incredible activists championing authentic social change. From mental health awareness and LGBTQ+ rights to greater racial equality, these trailblazers are committed to creating a brighter future for us all – bringing to life Clarks’ new global campaign, For the World Ahead. Through spotlighting their stories and supporting their chosen charities and initiatives, we’re ready to lead the way. After all, we’re originators, not imitators. It’s who we are, who we’ve always been. And to change the world of tomorrow, we’re doing things differently today.
  
Clarks International believes that the principle of equality of opportunity is fundamental to the company's operations. Our long held aim is to provide just and fair treatment for all employees. We will not discriminate on the grounds of sex, age, disability, marital status, colour, race, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation or gender reassignment.

Many of our interns return to the summer program multiple times, some remain throughout the year as co-op interns, and several join our company as full-time employees upon graduation through entry-level opportunities like our LDP (Leadership Development Program) rotational management program.
* Program Overview: The Orange & Rockland, Summer Internship program is a 10 - 12 week paid opportunity to gain hands-on experience with meaningful work, while developing your skills, and building your network. The internship has an estimated start date of June and an estimated end date of August/September. Internships are offered across our service territories (Orange County, Rockland County) and placements will be based on best fit for the business needs. As an Analyst Aide, you will be responsible for assisting Finance, Auditing, Treasury, Cost Management, and Strategic Planning, Corporate Affairs, or other business operations teams that support safe, reliable, and cost-effective energy delivery to our customers across our electric, gas, and steam commodities.

* Our Process: This is an interest posting to gather applications for internship candidates pursuing a bachelors or masters degree in business majors (as detailed below). After the application submission period is complete, the recruitment team will match candidate resumes to internal department requests. If your resume is a match for a specific department opportunity, a member of the recruitment team will contact you to share a more detailed job description and to schedule an interview. Interviews will be scheduled in the month of April. We utilize the behavioral events interview format and recommend practicing the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Results) response format.
