**Note: Teachers dually certified in TESOL, Bilingual Education or ESL, with experience in Sheltered Instruction or fluency in a language other than English, will be given preference for all Stamford Public School positions.**  

  

  

**General Statement:**  

The Connecticut State Board of Education (CSBE) believes that high-quality, comprehensive and effective English as a Second Language (ESL) and bilingual education programs are essential to acquire English language proficiency and academic proficiency for students who are English Learners (ELs). Bilingual Native Language Support teachers work under Section 10 17e(2) of the C.G.S. This statute defines bilingual education as a program that: “(A) Makes instructional use of both English and the eligible student’s native language; (B) enables eligible students to achieve English proficiency and academic mastery of subject matter content and higher order skills, including critical thinking, so as to meet appropriate grade promotion and graduation requirements; (C) provides for the continuous increase in the use of English and corresponding decrease in the use of the native language for the purpose of instruction within each year and from year to year and provides for the use of English for more than half of the instructional time by the end of the first year.”  

  

Bilingual Native Language Support teachers are bilingual certified instructors who teach students who are bilingual eligible and have selected bilingual support in their district school. The goal of the program is to provide native language support as a scaffold for students in order to make the core curriculum comprehensible while building language proficiency in English. Bilingual Native Language Support teachers provide both direct services, such as pull-out instruction, and indirect services, such as consultation with classroom teachers and/or push-in support, to eligible students who have been in the United States less than 30 months.  

  

Educational programs for ELs are regulated by the Every Student Succeeds Act, Title I and Title III. The Bilingual Native Language Support teacher receives supervision from building administration and technical supervision and assistance from the Coordinator of English Learners (EL).  

  

**Major Responsibilities:**
+ Provide instruction for students who are eligible for and have chosen to receive services
+ Make accommodations to curriculum so that content is accessible for ELs
+ Follow a push-in or pull-out model to best service students
+ Provide expertise to building principals and Coordinator of EL in planning and implementing programs which address the needs and abilities of the identified EL student population

+ Consult with classroom teachers as appropriate to support access to curriculum and instruction
+ Check in with academic subject area teachers to ensure that bilingual students are doing well in content area classes
+ Support EL students identified as needing additional support on the EL Monitoring Report

+ Act as a resource to teachers of eligible students in developing differentiated strategies for students with limited proficiency in English

+ Communicate with parents/guardians
+ Assist the Coordinator of EL in maintaining records and reports as requested by local, state or federal agencies
+ Work with building administration to develop reasonable schedules for students
+ Performs additional duties as assigned.
+

	- Bilingual, Pre-K – Grade 12 (009)
	- Bilingual Elementary Education, Pre-K – Grade 8 (902)
