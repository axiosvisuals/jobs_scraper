**About Syracuse University**
Syracuse University is a private, international research university with distinctive academics, diversely unique offerings, and an undeniable spirit. Located in the geographic heart of New York State, with a global footprint, and over 150 years of history, Syracuse University offers a quintessential college experience.  

  

The scope of Syracuse University is a testament to its strengths: a pioneering history dating back to 1870; a choice of more than 200 majors, 100 minors, and 200 advanced degree programs offered across the University’s 13 schools and colleges; over 15,000 undergraduates and over 6,000 graduate students; more than a quarter of a million alumni in 160 countries; and a student population from all 50 U.S. states and 123 countries. For more information, please visit http://www.syracuse.edu.
  

**About the Syracuse area**
Syracuse is a medium-sized city situated in the geographic center of New York State approximately 250 miles northwest of New York City. The metro-area population totals approximately 500,000. The area offers a low cost of living and provides many social, cultural, and recreational options, including parks, museums, festivals, professional regional theater, and premier shopping venues. Syracuse and Central New York present a wide range of seasonal recreation and attractions ranging from water skiing and snow skiing, hiking in the Adirondacks, touring the historic sites, visiting wineries along the Finger Lakes, and biking on trails along the Erie Canal.
  

**EEO Statement**
Syracuse University is an equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution. The University prohibits discrimination and harassment based on race, color, creed, religion, sex, gender, national origin, citizenship, ethnicity, marital status, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression, veteran status, or any other status protected by applicable law to the extent prohibited by law. This nondiscrimination policy covers admissions, employment, and access to and treatment in University programs, services, and activities.
  

**Commitment to Supporting and Hiring Veterans**
Syracuse University has a long history of engaging veterans and the military-connected community through its educational programs, community outreach, and employment programs. After World War II, Syracuse University welcomed more than 10,000 returning veterans to our campus, and those veterans literally transformed Syracuse University into the national research institution it is today. The University’s contemporary commitment to veterans builds on this historical legacy, and extends to both class-leading initiatives focused on making an SU degree accessible and affordable to the post-9/11 generation of veterans, and also programs designed to position Syracuse University as the employer of choice for military veterans, members of the Guard and Reserve, and military family members.
  

**Commitment to a Diverse and Inclusive Campus Community**
Syracuse University maintains an inclusive learning environment in which students, faculty, administrators, staff, curriculum, social activities, governance, and all other aspects of campus life reflect a diverse, multi-cultural, and international worldview. The University community recognizes and values the many similarities and differences among individuals and groups. At Syracuse, we are committed to preparing students to understand, live among, appreciate, and work in an inherently diverse country and world made up of people with different ethnic and racial backgrounds, military backgrounds, religious beliefs, socio-economic status, cultural traditions, abilities, sexual orientations and gender identities. To do so, we commit ourselves to promoting a community that celebrates and models the principles of diversity and inclusivity.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Syracuse-University","https://www.syr.edu","900 South Crouse Ave.

StaffCo is a Professional Employer Organization, commonly referred to as a PEO, duly organized and registered under the New York Professional Employer Organization law. StaffCo and SUNY have entered into a professional employer agreement under which StaffCo is the employer of Stony Brook Clinical Practice Management Plan employees and responsible for all aspects of employment, including hirings, promotions, disciplines, terminations, the day-to-day direction and supervision of work, as well as labor relations and collective bargaining. StaffCo is fully responsible for providing all payroll and human resources services, including the payment of wages, collecting and reporting payroll taxes and maintaining any and all employee benefits.  SUNY Stony Brook Hospital is responsible for the operation of the hospital and provision of health care and is the co-employer as is necessary to conduct its responsibilities and for related licensure, regulatory or statutory requirements and obligations.

Given StaffCo’s employment responsibilities, it is deemed the “employer” for employment and labor law purposes.  Thus, the employees are private sector employees of StaffCo, not public sector employees of SUNY.  The private sector nature of the StaffCo employees has been approved by NYS Civil Service and upheld in a decision by the US National Labor Relations Board.

Buddy Web Design & Development is a growing, entrepreneurial, and award-winning website design and development company headquartered in the Grand Rapids, Michigan area. Buddy has built a portfolio of clients across the United States, and is currently seeking help to grow the business by identifying and helping to secure new client projects.

Buddy is seeking an independent contractor who can spearhead sales and, in particular, lead-generation activities, including prospecting, outreach, and qualifying new sales leads. This work can be done remotely and part time, according to a schedule of your choosing.

While Buddy has traditionally offered high-quality website design and development and graphic design services for small- and mid-sized clients across a variety of industries, we're excited to add some additional new services and targeted opportunities this year. In particular, Buddy is adding to its service offering ongoing website support and maintenance plans, as well as ""all-in-one"" plans where Buddy designs, builds, and launches a new website for clients, and then takes care of ongoing hosting, maintenance, monitoring, updates, and edit requests, all for a low monthly fee, rather than the more traditional ""lump sum"" payment structure. We are excited about both these maintenance and all-in-one packages opening the doors to new prospective clients.

Further, Buddy is launching more targeted marketing efforts for these all-in-one plans, focusing initially on blue collar trades (buddywdd.com/tr) and healthcare practices (buddywdd.com/hc).

We're excited to partner with an experienced sales individual to help champion sales efforts for these new initiatives. An ideal person for this opportunity will have an entrepreneurial mindset, friendly and outgoing personality, and high degree of professionalism and integrity, coupled with a comfort and willingness to identify and reach out to prospective clients and build mutually beneficial relationships.

5+ years of business-to-business sales experience and a record of success is required, particularly in a sales role where you were required to generate your own leads, rather than working off a provided sales prospect list or via inbound leads.

Please note that this role is structured as an independent contractor opportunity, with compensation structured as commission only.

If this sounds interesting to you, and you’re excited to help grow an entrepreneurial business providing an in-demand technology service, please apply here.

NOTE: When applying, please be sure to share your experience regarding sales and lead generation in the accompanying screening questions, as well as affirming that you understand that this is a commission-based, independent contractor role. Applicants without responses to these questions will not be considered.
