Food & Water Action is working to defend democracy and the environment by electing climate champions on Long Island. We are building a door-to-door canvass that focuses on having conversations and motivating voters to support Democrats in the upcoming election.

You will join a team of paid canvassers who are committed to persuading undecided voters to vote for environmental candidates up and down the ballot, giving supporters the motivation to get others on board, and for helping protect clean and affordable water on Long Island.

**About Our Campaign:**

Food & Water Action has been working to build power in New York since 2010. We led the campaign to ban fracking and stop fossil fuel projects like the Port Ambrose gas export facility.

Now, we’re going to fight to elect Kamala Harris, defeat Donald Trump, and win a progressive Democratic majority in Congress. We need a strong Democratic majority in Congress if we’re going to override corporate polluters and the members of Congress they’ve bought. On Long Island, we’ll be asking voters to support Laura Gillen in the 4th district.

We’ll knock on 30,000 doors in the next few months, persuading and mobilizing voters while also building the local power we know we need to protect our food, water, and climate.

**Responsibilities:**

* Persuade undecided voters to vote for Laura Gillen and other Democrats

Well look no further---We are the Education & Outreach Company: a small business that makes education and outreach materials located in Tappan, NY.

And let's be honest, to say your job is to help make coloring books is pretty cool. We are looking for a warehouse/production manager to join our team!

Some basics about why the job is great and a point or two that might make it seem less great:

1. You will be working in our warehouse. We are looking for someone who can lead our warehouse operations to help manage our inventory, customize orders & fulfill orders to ship out to our clients.

4. We want the person we hire to learn in this role and grow into new ones. We’ve grown the last few years and plan to keep growing. As such, we want this role to grow with us.

5. We’re flexible. We understand that people have lives outside the office. We work hard to put in place processes that allow us to get our jobs done without our lives being taken over by the job. No one who works here misses a school concert, graduation, or other life event because of their job.

Now, let’s talk about the job requirements:

1. Good organizational & time management skills.  
2. Ability to lift heavy objects up to 60lbs.  
3. You need to be the type of person who gets joy out of getting things done.  
4. Our company isn’t that formal, but we do expect professionalism and punctuality.  
5. We expect intelligence, energy, and a get it done attitude. When you have questions, you will find our team is happy to help find the answers.

Finally, exactly what you would be doing:  
1. Receive & process warehouse inventory products (weigh, label, store).  
2. Prepare & fulfill customer orders to be picked-up according to schedule.  
3. Build boxes or pallets for shipment as needed.  
4. Build kits involving multiple items

**About Our Organization:**  

Visit our website! https://www.atidaynuourfuture.com/  

Are you ready to shape our future? Atidaynu’s goal is to help children with autism overcome their social and behavioral struggles. Each child is taught the skills that are most important to them as an individual, that will help them navigate through life and be good communicators and problem-solvers. Our program is designed for students who are diagnosed with autism and have language, social skills development, and academic needs. We provide direct social skill instruction, intensive language instruction, and academic instruction. We integrate an ABA approach as well as a structured classroom setting. All our lessons are modified to ensure that students with ASD can gain the most from the curriculum.  

**Job Type:**  

Full-time. Monday-Thursday 8:30 AM to 4:00 PM, Friday 8:30 AM to 1:00 PM.  

**Location:**  

Our Future School, LLC. 2959 Ave Y, Brooklyn NY 11235  

**Qualifications:**  

NY Registered Nurse (RN), Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) or Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) License.  

Must have experience working with the special needs community.  

**Responsibilities:**


* Help staff assess students within their educational setting.
* Develop individualized programs for students to use at home and in school.
* Attend annual training in autism disorders.


**Job Description:**  

School Nurses play an essential role in shaping the lives and futures of students! If you are looking for a career path that makes a difference in the world, then you should explore joining our team. You will make an immeasurable impact on our students’ lives and see the fruits of your labor in their progress day by day.  

You must have an interest in working with students with Special Needs, particularly those with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Autism has a broad spectrum of symptoms that vary in severity and type, including but not limited to deficits in Motor Skills, Sensory Processing, Executive Functioning, Verbal and Non-Verbal Communication, etc. Although ASD is a lifelong condition, treatments and services can greatly improve a person’s symptoms and ability to function. We take an ABA (Applied Behavioral Analysis) approach with our students.  

Our therapeutic team is patient, enthusiastic, understanding, and possesses a strong work ethic. Your investment in our students will pay off in leaps and bounds. Working with children with ASD is quite different than working with neurotypical children and will require many adjustments to expectations and approach. In addition to kindness, adaptability and flexibility are key. This is a challenging, but very fulfilling position.
