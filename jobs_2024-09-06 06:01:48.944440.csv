At Chick-fil-A Teterboro Landing FSR our purpose is “to enrich lives on both sides of the counter, by creating a culture of care.” Our biggest focus is on our team members. We understand that if we can positively influence and impact our team, then that will overflow into a genuine care to provide excellent service that goes above and beyond to our guests.
  
  

Why should you apply with us today? Please allow me to give you three reasons.
  
  

1. Engaged Leadership - We have a leadership team that is on your side. It is our goal to help you win and help you become the best version of yourself. Whether Chick-fil-A is just a stepping stone or a career path, our goal is to develop life and leadership skills that will make you successful and competitive no matter where you go!
  
2. Opportunities for growth - We are a rapidly growing restaurant and we are constantly looking to develop talented leaders that have a passion to serve and help others. Opportunities include trainers, team leaders, shift leaders, directors of operations, marketing, talent, training and hospitality are all leadership positions within our restaurant. Not only are there in-restaurant opportunities, but the talents and leadership skills developed at Chick-fil-A can be used in whatever work environment you decide to pursue.
  
3. Impact and purpose - Chick-fil-A of Teterboro Landing FSR is looking to create an impact in our local communities by providing donations with local schools, churches, charitable organizations and even other businesses. Among this, we partner with a local church to help serve the homeless and those of lower opportunity. We believe that as a brand and local restaurant, we have a tremendous opportunity to enrich the lives of those in our community, and that also includes you, part of our team.
  
  

Requirements/Responsibilities
  
Do you have what we're looking for?
  
  

There are really 5 crucial that we look for in our team members. We believe that out of these 5 things, most other qualities or requirements will flow naturally.
  
  

1. Reliable - We are looking for individuals that we can count on. We need to be able to trust that you will arrive punctually to each shift you’ve been assigned, and that you will accomplish the tasks assigned to you.
  
2. Integrity - We want a committed team that we can trust to handle ALL guest interactions with the utmost care. We also understand the importance of teamwork, which means there needs to be a level of trust that is deep and genuine with the attitude of a servant’s heart. You must be trustworthy in all circumstances in order to gain the trust of individuals.
  
3. Hungry - (I’m sorry, but this doesn’t relate to food;) We are looking for individuals who have a passion for growth. Hungry team members take efforts to improve themselves during and outside of work, they have plans for bettering themselves. Hungry team members are always striving to do and accomplish more even when others don’t see anything that needs to be done. In other words, you push hard and strive to be the best you can.
  
4. Humble - Humility is the lynchpin of being on a team. If you can’t admit weaknesses, confess mistakes and ask for help from others, this will be a difficult job for you. Everyone makes mistakes, but it’s how we humble ourselves so others can address us, and how we learn from them that matters.
  
5. Smart - This refers to both being smart intellectually, but more importantly, to emotional intelligence. It means that you are wise in communicating, and understand the impact that your words, attitude or body language can have. It means understanding people and knowing what or what not to say, and when or when not to say it.
  
  

These are some of the main qualities that we are looking for in our team members. As I have said before, teamwork is so important to everything done in the restaurant. If you are not looking for a place that will challenge you to grow, incur great communication, and push you to put others first, you will not enjoy working here. We are heavily invested in character development and striving to bring out the best in each of our team members.

Through an array of capacity building support services, the new AmeriCorps VISTA Steward for Groundwork Hudson Valley will play an instrumental role in moving three high-profile environmental projects forward in the EJ community of Southwest Yonkers. Activities will involve organizing and refining project outreach efforts through an equity lens, organizing volunteer stewardship initiatives to increase and broaden their impact, and helping raise critically needed resources to sustain these programs over time. Projects include a major effort to transform a large neighborhood brownfield site into the Yonkers Greenway, an initiative developed and designed by the local community. Along an abandoned commuter rail line, the greenway will revitalize one of the city’s most socially and economically distressed neighborhoods. The second project involves the restoration of the Saw Mill River, an impaired tributary to the Hudson River flowing through the center of Southwest Yonkers around which are major public parks and commercial districts. This section of the stream is also at the bottom of the watershed and most subject to trash, fecal coliform and high stream velocities connected to extreme weather and climate change. The third project involves preparing the community for a range of climate-related threats such as heat waves, sea level rise, hurricanes and storm surge. Southwest Yonkers is along the Hudson River coast, is the most densely built part of the city, and the most disadvantaged, making it especially vulnerable to climate concerns and in need of resiliency initiatives. Through a project developed with Groundwork USA and NOAA, the organization has mapped a range of climate risks in Southwest Yonkers and is running the Climate Safe Yonkers Task Force to address these issues in the community. The VISTA Steward will help develop the long-term capacity and sustainability of this project.
