If you're a strategic visionary who lives and breathes direct response and brand marketing, with a proven track record of scaling online campaigns to new heights, we want you on our team.

Sound like your kind of challenge? Keep reading...

  

You are successful in this role when you have tripled our inbound call volume with qualified leads and substantially increased our social media following, subscriber base on Youtube, and have facilitated the conversion of that organic following into clients.

* Work closely with our media buyer (unless that’s also you), copywriters, graphic designers, and video editors to assemble all necessary marketing assets in a timely manner and ensure our KPIs are being met.
* Oversee content strategy to continue growing our Youtube channel and social media following.
* Be mindful of project/task budgets to produce results as profitably as possible, without compromising quality.
* Understand our messaging, philosophy, core content pillars, and our client avatar as closely as you know your own family members.

* Be able analyze data and assess how effective various campaigns and angles are performing, so that we can identify which messages and ideas are most effective for future content.
* Have a deep understanding of our marketing assets (ie. webinars, trainings, whitepapers, etc…) so they can be leveraged to grow our list and get clients.
* Keep an open line of communication with our sales team to keep a pulse on the quality of leads booking calls (and their conversions).
* Study our Healthpreneur® Brand Identity document and related Company Culture documents to be 100% clear on the company vision, core values, ideal clients, important processes, and overall business model
* Attend Weekly Sync (team meeting), weekly 1-on-1 meeting with CEO, monthly and quarterly strategic planning meetings.
* Hire, lead, coach, and develop your direct reports (on the marketing team) so that you can get the best performance out of all team members.

And you have a strong ability to clearly organize, plan, and communicate your ideas so that they get executed in a methodical and effective manner (rather than just shooting from the hip on a whim).
* You are VERY proficient creating and using spreadsheets (Google sheets) to analyze your team’s marketing performance such as ad spend, CPMs, clicks, and conversions. We are heavily data driven and you must be as well.
* You LOVE DATA and understand how to track and improve campaigns based on important metrics.
* You have sharp copywriting skills and you understand conversion rate optimization. When you look at an offer (or marketing asset) you can see the gaps and opportunities to make it stronger based on how the message and/or page layout/design can be improved for better conversions.

* You are OBSESSED with growing and getting better. You voraciously consume content (marketing and sales related podcasts, books, courses, etc…) to help you sharpen your sword.
* You have a high intolerance for “average” and working with B-players. You want to be the best at what you do, produce the best possible work, and only work with the best people. And you don’t shy away from having hard conversations with those who don’t meet those standards.
* You’ve studied (or worked with) some of the marketing greats like Alex Hormozi, Ogilvy, Eugene Schwartz, Brian Kurtz, Frank Kern, Ryan Deiss (Digital Marketer), Perry Belcher, Dan Kennedy, Joe Polish, Russell Brunson, Ezra Firestone, Dean Jackson, etc… (if you don’t know who these people are, this isn’t the right role for you).

 **About Our Company - Healthpreneur**

 **Growth. Owner-Like Work Ethic. Speed.**

  

These are essential traits to thrive as a team member at Healthpreneur®.

  

We are the leading coaching and training company for helping health professionals and coaches get clients and scale their coaching businesses online…without the grind.

  

We are a remote, high performance team with a culture that is obsessed with excellence.

  

In a world where most businesses (and the people within them) are average at best, we refuse to join their ranks.

  

We are obsessed with helping our clients make their dreams happen in the service of others, while creating a company that is an industry leader for decades to come.

  

We cannot achieve this vision without incredible people.

  

But, if you’re looking for a cushy job with tons of time off, healthcare benefits, ping pong tables, and the ability to “switch off” when you leave the office, this isn’t for you.

  

If you get overwhelmed easily and your life is a mess, this isn’t for you.

  

If you strive to do the bare minimum or think that simply getting tasks done is doing a great job, then this isn’t for you.

  

Working at Healthpreneur® requires a ""winner"" mindset. We go above and beyond, not because we have to but because we want to. It’s who we are.

  

We’re looking for high-performers who are so effective that they can do the work of 2 people.

  

We are a performance-based company that rewards hitting outcomes, not completing tasks.

  

On our team, 80% of success is NOT just “showing up”. To be successful with us, you must actually move the needle by helping our business generate more revenue, become more profitable, or help our clients succeed - that’s it.

  

This isn’t a place to work if you’re looking for a job, but rather a fulfilling career where you can grow to your fullest potential.

  

In our minds, work-life balance is a fairy tale. The reality is that your work affects your life and your life affects your work. That's why we practice work-life integration.

  

We believe in living a good life. A life built on freedom. But freedom doesn’t mean doing nothing and living the 4-hour workweek leaving you bored out of your mind.

  

For us, freedom means being able to live life on your terms and contribute in meaningful ways through work that inspires and lights you up, while enjoying life along the way (not when you retire).

  

At Healthpreneur®, we work hard - not because we have to but because we want to.

  


We don’t expect you to work 24/7 but you are expected to do what needs to be done to move the needle in your role.

  

If you’re selected to work with us, you are not accepting a 9-5, “punch in, punch out” job. And we are certainly not a company where you’d expect to completely disconnect every weekend…especially if clients or team members are counting on you to keep the ball rolling.

  

Although we encourage setting boundaries and creating space to relax and recharge, when you love what you do, you don’t need to escape from work. Doing work you love feels like a vacation. And when you do have some time off, you’re still thinking about your work because you’re obsessed with it (in a healthy way).

  

Again, this isn't a job. This is a passion. This is a career with incredible growth potential with a company that is transforming a broken healthcare model.

  

We’re looking for winners who are hungry, competitive, and driven.

  

Is that you?

  

Our culture is based on the premise “Be Great. Do Great” - regardless of location. Since our team is virtual, it’s about how we show up day after day, how we behave and treat one another in and outside of work. It’s about being a self-starter who does what’s needed to get done and who is held accountable to specifically defined targets without having a manager breathing over your shoulder.

  

It’s about our shared values and how we communicate those values to each other and our clients. Regular two-way feedback, collaboration, and transparency within our team and our clients isn’t something we thought would sound good. It’s what we BELIEVE in and what we PRACTICE.

  

Strong culture inside the business equates to strong culture outside the business (with our clients) which is probably why we have grown so quickly  



  

We live and breathe the following 3 core values:

 **Speed is King**



Getting things done quickly is more important than doing them perfectly. By moving quickly, we expedite our learning and fast track our success.

 **Owner-Like Commitment**



We are dedicated to doing great work and going above and beyond because the business' success (and that of our clients) is our success.

 **Driven to Grow**



We are voracious learners and we love a good challenge because it brings out our innate desire to grow and become our best.
