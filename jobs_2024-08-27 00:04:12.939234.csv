**The Pain of Inefficiency** - Do you often find yourself noticing ways things could be done more efficiently? Whether it's at work, in your personal life, or even just observing others, you can't help but feel a physical discomfort when you witness inefficiency. The urge to intervene and suggest a better way of doing things can be almost overwhelming. In fact, inefficiency can actually cause you physical discomfort. The pain of inefficiency is real, and it's something that many people experience.

**Root Cause Solutions** - While some may be content with temporary fixes to problems, you have a keen eye for identifying the root cause and refuse to settle for anything less than a permanent solution. When others are quick to suggest working harder to make up for lost time, you take a step back to analyze the situation and find the underlying roadblocks that are causing delays. Rather than pushing harder, you focus on removing these obstacles to achieve greater success with less effort. While others may be content with giving it more gas, you prefer to release the e-brake and achieve better results by tackling the problem at its source.

**The Satisfaction of a Job Well Done** - While compliments and financial rewards are certainly nice, there's nothing quite like the feeling of things working just right. It's that feeling that makes your work truly meaningful and keeps you motivated to keep pushing forward. Whether it's a project coming together seamlessly or a process that runs smoothly without any hiccups, that sense of accomplishment is truly priceless. And the best part is seeing the positive impact it has on those around you. Knowing that your efforts have made others happy and productive is the ultimate reward, and it's what keeps you coming back for more.

**Reliability and Accountability** - When you commit to a task or role, you don't just get it done - you get it done exceptionally well, without any hesitation or need for supervision. You take pride in your ability to be reliable and accountable, consistently delivering results that exceed expectations. But it's not just about your own performance - you also have a talent for holding others accountable and ensuring that they fulfill their responsibilities. You take on the role of a responsible leader, proactively checking in on others and providing support to help them achieve their goals. Your commitment to reliability and accountability is a testament to your professionalism and dedication to excellence.

**Ahead of Schedule and Under Budget**


You have a mindset of running operations ahead of schedule and under budget that involves prioritizing efficiency and effectiveness, setting goals and timelines, and constantly seeking ways to improve processes to achieve optimal results.

***As our ideal COO / Integrator, you will work closely with our CEO / Visionary to turn his vision into actionable plans for the company. Your ability to work hand in hand with our CEO and bring his ideas and vision to life will be key to our success. You should be detail-oriented, data-driven, and process-oriented, with a passion for optimizing and streamlining operations. As a leader within our organization, you will also mentor and model behaviors for those around you, fostering a culture of excellence and continuous improvement.***

**Bronx, NY**


Seton Education Partners is seeking a detail-oriented Human Resources Coordinator to spearhead establishing and optimizing efficient people systems. This pivotal role involves collaborating with multiple stakeholders in the school community, supporting staff with various employment needs, and upholding the policies and procedures of the Brilla Public Charter Schools Network.

**About Seton Education Partners**


Co-founded in 2009 by KIPP pioneer Scott W. Hamilton and Teach for America alumna Stephanie Saroki de García, Seton Education Partners is a response to the dramatic decline of urban Catholic schools which have historically been the greatest equalizing factor for economically underserved children, families and communities in America for decades.


Specifically, Seton expands opportunities for parents in underserved communities to choose an academically excellent, character rich, and—for those who seek it—vibrantly Catholic education for their children. As a national non-profit, Seton partners with (arch)dioceses and others across the country to implement innovative and sustainable new models that bridge the best of Catholic education's rich tradition with new possibilities. Seton was born of the belief that a tremendous opportunity exists to revitalize urban Catholic schools in America and strengthen the education they provide. The challenges are significant, to be sure, but with an entrepreneurial and innovative spirit, much can and should be done, not only to preserve this national treasure but also to build on its foundation for the benefit of thousands of children in America’s most underserved neighborhoods.


Seton has pioneered multiple innovative and high-impact solutions to the shuttering of Catholic schools in underserved communities. Seton is working to take these remarkable achievements to scale by managing a network of schools and programs that ensure that thousands of underserved children whose Catholic schools close—and other local children—have access to an academically excellent, character-building, and, for those who choose it, faith-nurturing education. Seton provides a national model for how other cities facing the shuttering of Catholic schools can continue to serve children and families with limited educational options. For more information on Seton Education Partners, please visit www.SetonPartners.org.

**About the Brilla Schools Network**


Brilla Public Charter Schools is a network of K-8th grade schools that currently serves nearly 1,600 students from Mott Haven, University Heights and other neighborhoods in the Bronx. The network plans to grow from a current four elementary and one middle school to five elementary and five middle schools educating some 4,000 students in the Bronx and Paterson, NJ. Core to our mission is that our students become young men and women of good character and spirit and be prepared for excellence in high school, college, and beyond. Brilla combines a classical approach to education - an emphasis on virtue formation, Truth, Beauty, and Goodness, and direct instruction of a content-rich curriculum that has stood the test of time - with co-teaching practices and individualized online learning.\\* We approach the formation of our students holistically and also set high academic expectations. Ours is a joyful community that honors the dignity of each student, family member and staff.

**About El Camino Network**


El Camino, which means “The Way” in Spanish, is an optional, privately-funded Catholic after-school faith formation program that is closely partnered with Brilla charter schools. El Camino helps children, their families and their catechists to know, love and serve Christ and His Church; develop the habits, dispositions and beliefs that are indispensable to human flourishing and happiness; and live as disciples in this world and saints in the next. El Camino honors the teaching authority of the Catholic Church. In the last 10 years, over 230 children have been baptized through our program.


El Camino currently serves approximately 40% of Brilla’s students for 90 minutes a day, Monday through Thursday. Children receive homework help from experienced teachers, a nutritious snack, and 30 minutes each of catechism and physical fitness. Additionally, children and families have opportunities for shared and personal prayer and character formation. This video provides a snapshot of El Camino. El Camino will grow to serve children through 8th grade, growing a grade level at a time each year.

For over 135 years, we have collaborated with our neighbors to pioneer highly effective programs that fight poverty and systemic inequality. Established in 1886 as the first Settlement House in the United States, we bring the values of that movement into the 21st century by meeting New Yorkers where they live, listening deeply to all perspectives, engaging with every individual holistically, and creating space for people to organize. Joining together with our neighbors to advocate for justice and equality, we help build community strength.


We work with New Yorkers of all ages. We infuse a commitment to civic engagement, equity, and communal action into each of our programs, which include early childhood education, mental health and wellness, benefits assistance and eviction prevention, adult literacy and education, healthy aging, community, and recreation centers, performing and visual arts, and youth development.

**What is a Success Mentor?**

Success Mentors partner with severely chronically absent and chronically absent youth to address the barriers that keep them from attending school every day. They are caring adults that support students and help them reach their educational goals.

**Rationale**

One in five New York City students is chronically absent, missing more than 18+ days of school during the school year. Missing school drastically affects a student's learning and outcomes in academics and connectedness with their community.


Research shows that chronically absent students who have been assigned a Success Mentor gain, on average, attend 13+ days of school compared to the year prior. The significant jump helps students exit chronic absenteeism. Students who attend school regularly and are not chronically absent are more likely to have higher GPAs, more likely to attend college, and feel more connected to their school community.

**Responsibilities:**

* Meet individually with assigned mentees for at least 5-10 minutes weekly
* Provide academic support during classroom push-ins
* Connect mentee and their family network to internal and external resources based on their individual needs
* Communicate with parents/guardians about mentees progress and challenges daily/weekly
* Communicate with teachers weekly; stay abreast of mentees major projects/assignments/testing dates
* Review weekly attendance reports with the Community School Director and Social Worker
* Work with mentee to define and establish goals that will address the reasons for their severely chronically absent and chronically absenteeism, as well as any SEL needs during the school day
* Support the Attendance team with making and monitoring referrals
* Support the school and students during transition between class
* De-escalate situations and work with students on SEL activities to help them return to class
* Collect and maintain comprehensive, up-to-date, and accurate records, including attendance

**Qualifications:**

* Bachelors degree in arts, education, counseling or a related field preferred (HS diploma or HSE required)
* At least 2 years previous experience working with youth from diverse backgrounds
* Experience in conflict resolution, crisis counseling, and de-escalation strategies
* Strong background in program development, arts, curriculum design, and lesson plan writing
* Demonstrated cultural sensitivity
* Strong organizational, written, and verbal skills
* Self-directed and able to work as part of a team
* Creativity, flexibility, and commitment
* Bi-lingual Spanish a plus

**Work Schedule:** Part time, Monday - Friday, 9:00 am - 1:00 pm, 20 hours a week
