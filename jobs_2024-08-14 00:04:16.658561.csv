All of those accounts are subject to the Code’s investment and securities account restrictions, and new employees must comply with those investment restrictions—including disposing of any security issued by a company on FINRA’s Prohibited Company List or obtaining a written waiver from their Executive Vice President—by the date they begin employment with FINRA. Employees may only maintain securities accounts that must be disclosed to FINRA at one or more securities firms that provide an electronic feed (e-feed) of data to FINRA, and must move securities accounts from other securities firms to a firm that provides an e-feed within three months of beginning employment.

Harry's Inc. is building a modern CPG company by putting people first and delivering against real unmet consumer needs.  

  

The company's flagship brand - Harry's - was founded by Jeff Raider and Andy Katz-Mayfield in 2013. After successfully launching and scaling Harry's, Jeff and Andy saw an opportunity to bring their experience building Harry's to other CPG categories where the consumer has also been historically underserved.  

  

Harry's Inc. has grown significantly over the last ten years, and is now made up of four brands - Harry's, Flamingo, Lume, Mando - and Harry's Labs, the company's incubation and M&A engine. The company employs more than 900 people across the U.S., U.K. and Germany, and is the largest CPG company built in the last 20 years.  

  

At Harry's Inc, our mission is to Create Things People Like More — whether it's a product, an experience, or an internal tool, we believe in making the things around us better for our customers, and our team.  

  

Our mission extends beyond customers and team, to the community broadly. We believe that the best business models make a positive impact. So, we set aside 1% of sales across Harry's, Flamingo, and Lume to support our social mission, including through donations to our nonprofit partners.  

  

At the end of the day, the key to our success is our amazing people. From chemists, mechanical engineers, CX associates, to creative directors, sourcing managers, and logistics specialists, the Harry's team is composed of some of the most brilliant, diverse, and humble people you'll ever meet.

**Reports to:** Crew Manager


**Status:** Full Time; Regular, Non-Exempt

**Days/Hours:** Monday - Friday**,** 9:00am to 5:00pm

**Organization Overview:**


The Fortune Society, Inc. (Fortune) has been working for over 54 years in service to our mission: to support successful reentry from incarceration and promote alternatives to incarceration, thus strengthening the fabric of our communities. The organization has evolved into one of the nations preeminent reentry and justice-informed service organizations, providing formerly-incarcerated people with the skills and wrap-around services needed to break the cycle of crime and incarceration and to build productive lives in their communities.


Fortune has grown steadily over the years to an agency just under $79 million in annual budget with just under 600 staff. We anticipate that we will keep growing, both in size and in depth of service. Fortune has a dual mission: both advocacy and service. The advocacy portion of our mission focuses on building a more just criminal legal system and reducing the barriers to reentry into society. The service side of Fortune has evolved to encompass a broad range of programs that started with employment and education and now includes a robust array of services, among them: alternatives to incarceration, supervised release, court advocacy, discharge planning within correctional facilities, licensed substance use and mental health treatment, a housing continuum ranging from emergency and transitional through permanent congregate and scattered site housing, assistance in obtaining benefits, a care management unit, HIV services, a food and nutrition program, and an arts program. Each service we provide is informed by the needs of the population we serve. Fortune currently serves approximately 11,000 people a year. Our client population mirrors the incarcerated population in being approximately 85% male and over 90% people of color. Our program models are recognized, both nationally and internationally for their quality and innovation.

**Position Summary**

In this role, you'll take charge of installing and maintaining our rapidly growing network of restaurants, bars, and gyms across New York, all while nurturing strong relationships with our partners.

**This position is critical, requiring individuals with relevant experience and AV knowledge.**

While our product installation may seem straightforward (involving only HDMI, power, and RCA connections), tackling restaurant AV systems can be challenging. Given that our product is still relatively new, robust problem-solving skills are essential, alongside a deep understanding of AV systems.

We're specifically seeking candidates with extensive expertise in AV rack systems and restaurant environments, as this is essential for success in the role.

**Who we are:**  
Taiv is a fast-growing startup. We build a TV box that detects and replaces TV commercials in restaurants/bars. This lets us show more relevant content, such as the venue's own drink specials, upcoming events, etc. during the commercial breaks, as well as sell more targeted (and valuable) ads.

We’re the first (and only) company in the world that can detect TV commercials accurately. We share a significant percentage of our ad revenue with our restaurant partners. We help make local businesses more profitable and are really proud of what we do. Here’s an article with some more info about us from TechCrunch (https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/no-mute-necessary-taiv-replaces-live-tv-ads-at-bars-with-custom-content/)

We’re a 27-person team that genuinely enjoys working together. We have a fun culture and strive to create an easy-going work environment. We graduated from Y Combinator, the world’s top tech accelerator in winter 2020. Program alumni include Airbnb, Instacart, DoorDash, etc. (www.ycombinator.com/topcompanies).

We have already launched the South Florida, Tampa Bay, Austin, San Antonio and Phoenix markets, with over 200 live locations. We just launched the New York market, and are looking for a motivated, reliable AV Tech to keep things running smoothly and rapidly scale it.

We have raised over $3 million from top tech investors so that we can bring this technology across the USA. This is a super exciting time to join an early-stage startup and get in on the action!

**Qualifications:**

* Experience in AV and Technical Support
* High school or equivalent (Required)
