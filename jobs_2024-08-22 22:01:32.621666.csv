**Empower Every New Yorker — Without Exception — to Live the Healthiest Life Possible**

NYC Health + Hospitals is the largest public health care system in the United States. We provide essential outpatient, inpatient and home-based services to more than one million New Yorkers every year across the city’s five boroughs. Our large health system consists of ambulatory centers, acute care centers, post-acute care/long-term care, rehabilitation programs, Home Care, and Correctional Health Services. Our diverse workforce is uniquely focused on empowering New Yorkers, without exception, to live the healthiest life possible.

At NYC Health + Hospitals, our mission is to deliver high quality care health services, without exception. Every employee takes a person-centered approach that exemplifies the ICARE values (Integrity, Compassion, Accountability, Respect, and Excellence) through empathic communication and partnerships between all persons.

Job Description

Housing for Health (HFH) at NYC Health + Hospitals (H+H) recognizes that the chronic health issues of unhoused individuals cannot be treated without stable housing. This initiative seeks to improve the health and wellbeing of New Yorkers by focusing on four strategic areas: housing navigation services, medical respite beds, affordable housing on hospital property, and social service support for patients in permanent housing.

HFH is seeking a Director of Housing Clinical Services to serve in a clinical leadership role, managing clinical operations, integration and strategy across all aspects of HFH programming. This position will collaborate and partner with a diverse range of stakeholders within and beyond our large public hospital system, combining patient-level clinical triage, assessment, consultation, problem-solving and care planning, with high-level strategic direction and leadership of systemwide improvement efforts to improve clinical operational design, policy, protocols, and workflows to ensure high quality and patient-centered care to an underserved patient population. In general, this position will be responsible for developing and implementing the clinical infrastructure to ensure patients are referred and placed in appropriate housing options, with the necessary health and support services to improve health outcomes and maintain housing retention. The individual will be responsible for clinical management of the H+H medical respite facilities, which provide interim housing, clinical services and case management for patients experiencing homelessness who need more intensive support than would be available in the shelter system or on the streets.

HFH is seeking Board Certified/Eligible Advanced Practice Practitioner candidates with strong clinical skills and demonstrated experience working with people experiencing homelessness who have complex medical and/or behavioral health conditions. The position will report to the Assistant Vice President overseeing Housing for Health, with an indirect reporting line to the Medical Director.

This will also include identifying and addressing barriers to housing placement and collaborating with internal and external stakeholders to address gaps through policy, regulatory and programmatic tools.

**Clinical Referral Management**: This position will be responsible for comprehensive clinical triage and assessment of referrals to Housing for Health for housing navigation and placement services, which may include determining appropriate permanent housing options and level of care needed, prioritization of need, assessing for required medical and social service supports, and coordinating with internal and external stakeholders to facilitate seamless, safe and effective transitions between settings. The individual will also be responsible for liaising with referring care teams to confirm longitudinal care needs are met, guiding partners through the process of establishing long term care benefits for appropriate patients and liaising with licensed/certified home care agencies. As needed, the Director may liaise with NYC Human Resource Administration and other city agencies to ensure patients are qualified for the appropriate housing type.

**Respite Clinical Oversight**: HFH contracts for with two non-profit vendors to provide medical respite services. The position will be responsible for development of clinical protocols and guidelines, referral management, including conducting comprehensive clinical assessments to determine patient eligibility and appropriateness for program services, and coordinating with referring healthcare providers and respite staff to facilitate seamless and safe transitions to medical respite. The position will also conduct clinical visit to medical respite sites, overseeing care plans for patients, coordinating delivery of clinical services, determining medical clearance, and supporting respite staff with discharge planning

**Systemwide Clinical Consultation:** This position will provide skilled and timely clinical advice at multiple points throughout its housing system. This consultation may include providing advice to referring partners prior to HFH referral, liaising between systemwide referral points and Housing Location and Placement Services vendor, and consultation with on-site providers at H+H contracted interim or permanent housing sites to problem solve specific client issues including triage of clinical need, and linkage to specialty care, primary care, behavioral health services, and other community resources.

**Quality Improvement, Evaluation and Data Tracking:** This position will be responsible for program wide quality improvement initiatives that target high quality and patient-centered care throughout the housing journey, aimed at achieving improved health care outcomes and residential stability.

At Charles Tyrwhitt our purpose is to “Make it easy for men to dress well” and we can’t do that without our sales team.


Join us at our exciting new store opening in Grand Central in early August. We're looking to hire enthusiastic individuals to join us starting in early July, helping us prepare for our big launch. Don't miss this opportunity to be part of our growing family and make a mark right from the start!

**What you will be doing**


You will be responsible for providing exceptional customer service and be the touch point for each and every customer. Our Sales Associates will be provided training to support our clients with styling and fit advice, as well as tailoring and custom product sales service. Your natural interest in providing exceptional service will mean you always put the customer first, providing a warm welcome to our shop, always representing the CT Brand. Your role will also include general store operations such as restocking, shipment and using the register.

**What we are looking for**


We are looking for a confident Sales Associate who can connect with our customers, deliver excellence in customer experience, and offer advice on current trends relevant to our clientele. Previous experience in a similar position is a huge advantage to this role. Interest in menswear is necessary, plus training is provided to help you understand our brand.

**What you can expect from us**


CT is a privately-owned business, so we're not a big corporate-style place to work. Our senior leaders are transparent and approachable, and we welcome ideas to make this a great place to work. We value our people whilst being product and customer obsessed.

**Who we are**


Once upon a shirt, Nicholas Charles Tyrwhitt Wheeler had the notion that he could make a better shirt at better value than anyone else in the world! He believed that all men; no matter their shape or size, where they may be in the world or indeed their budget; should be able to own a Jermyn Street quality shirt. A proper shirt. A CT shirt.


That was over 3 decades ago and whilst Charles Tyrwhitt (it rhymes with spirit by the way) is still famous for proper shirts, these days we are about so much more than collars and cuffs. Our purpose is to “make it easy for men to dress well”. We take care of the entire wardrobe, providing stylish solutions for every occasion. We make sure he gets what he wants, when and how he wants it.


Charles Tyrwhitt’s spiritual home and flagship store is located on London’s Jermyn Street, in the United Kingdom where our presence is well know. We also have a strong online presence in the US, with retail stores in 7 states and a New York head office. We also operate across Europe and Australia! Pretty impressive, eh? And as of 2022, we're proud to be recognized as a carbon-neutral retailer as we continue our journey to be a sustainable business.

Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.  

  

So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.  

  

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.

* Engage and partner with onboarding teams to ensure Sellers are implemented successfully
* Build a sustainable, top of funnel pipeline through a combination of tactics - walking your city and performing 50-60 drop-ins a week to prospective sellers, create a referral channel with active Square sellers, strategic partnerships or local community associations
* Develop a strong on-hands skill of demo and onboarding of Square hardware and software solutions
* Work with our channel sales team to identify complementary partners in your market for referrals and build that referral channel
