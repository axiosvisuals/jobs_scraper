Opportunities Available  



As a Biomedical Engineering intern at Stryker, you will be placed in one of the following teams:  



**Quality**  



*Advanced Quality*


AQE interns work on engineering projects related to development of new products. Areas of emphasis may include human factors engineering, risk management, application of statistics, reliability engineering, design verification, and design validation including customer interaction. As Homer Stryker pointed out, “If your tools don’t work, make them work. If you can’t make them work, make some that do work.” In this directive, the AQE team works to make sure that the products we develop at Stryker will work consistently for our customers to meet or exceed their expectations.  



*Process Quality*


PQE interns collaborate with cross-functional teams to support product sustainment. When non-conforming issues arise in production, it is our responsibility to perform robust root cause analysis and implement effective corrective actions. Do you enjoy deep dive investigations and driving collaboration and communication to achieve issue resolution? If so, you may be a great fit for this team! PQE interns are focused on quality, compliance and continuous improvement. They use their education to work with a variety of tools including CAD for fixture design, root cause analysis methods, LabView, and validation activities to optimize production, inspection, and quality system processes.  



*Supplier Quality*

Do you enjoy using your technical background and communication skills to influence suppliers? If so, you might be a great fit for this diverse and talented team! The role requires working closely with internal customers from multiple functions, meeting with suppliers frequently, and the use of both technical and business skills.  



*Quality*


Quality interns work with our internal cross-functional teams and external sales team and customers to ensure we develop and sustain a product with the highest quality. The team’s job is to ensure we develop the right products up front – evaluate risk, ensure our customer’s user needs are met, and help drive craftsmanship, safety, durability and reliability into the product. On the post-market side, they also work closely with regulatory to handle any complaints and implement design changes, as needed, to address quality issues. The role requires someone who has great communication, problem-solving, and technical skills.  



**Research & Development**  



*New Product Development*


R&D interns in New Product Development work with cross-functional teams to identify the needs and the goals of future products.

Product Engineering interns work with a variety of tools, including CAD, FEA, Test Labs, and root cause analysis methods. These interns utilize their technical education to improve the safety and efficacy of our existing products.  



**Test Lab**  



Test interns partner closely with Test Engineers and R&D to experiment with early prototypes and vet out product designs throughout the design process. What this really means is that they get to be the MythBusters of the division. You think your design can last the entire expected service life? We put it to the test. Just like the show, we quickly design and build fixtures to simulate real life situations. In addition to these experiments, they are ultimately responsible for design verification – the quantitative testing of the technical specifications of the product. A team’s experience ranges from 2 to over 15 years with technical specialties ranging from sterilization, mechanical, electrical, software, and optics. If you’re the type of person that has the magic ability to break things – we want you!  



**Manufacturing**  



Manufacturing Engineer interns will collaborate with Design and Operations to deliver best-in-class new products to market. Interns will partner with technicians and engineers to improve Stryker’s manufacturing lines through new fixture development, assembly line process enhancement, implementation of lean manufacturing principles, and improving ergonomics and safety.

What You Get Out of the Internship


Stryker, a global leader in medical technology takes great pride in their people, and that’s why we’re looking to expand our talent.

* Apply classroom knowledge and gain experience in a fast-paced and growing industry setting
* Implement new ideas, be constantly challenged, and develop your skills
* Network with key/high-level stakeholders and leaders of the business
* Be a part of an innovative team and culture
* Impact the development and manufacturing of cutting-edge products


Opportunities Available


As a Software Engineering intern at Stryker, you will be placed in one of the following teams:

 **Quality**

*Advanced Quality*


AQE interns work on engineering projects related to development of new products. Areas of emphasis may include human factors engineering, risk management, application of statistics, reliability engineering, design verification, and design validation including customer interaction. As Homer Stryker pointed out, “If your tools don’t work, make them work. If you can’t make them work, make some that do work.” In this directive, the AQE team works to make sure that the products we develop at Stryker will work consistently for our customers to meet or exceed their expectations.


*Process Quality*


PQE interns collaborate with cross-functional teams to support product sustainment. When non-conforming issues arise in production, it is our responsibility to perform robust root cause analysis and implement effective corrective actions. Do you enjoy deep dive investigations and driving collaboration and communication to achieve issue resolution? If so, you may be a great fit for this team! PQE interns are focused on quality, compliance and continuous improvement. They use their education to work with a variety of tools including CAD for fixture design, root cause analysis methods, LabView, and validation activities to optimize production, inspection, and quality system processes.

  



*Supplier Quality*

SQE interns are responsible for all things supplier-related. Stryker uses a number of critical suppliers to manufacture components and finished products, and to provide critical services. This team’s job is to work closely with the suppliers to ensure components and their manufacturing processes meet our required standards. Do you enjoy using your technical background and communication skills to influence suppliers? If so, you might be a great fit for this diverse and talented team! The role requires working closely with internal customers from multiple functions, meeting with suppliers frequently, and the use of both technical and business skills.


*Quality*


Quality interns work with our internal cross-functional teams and external sales team and customers to ensure we develop and sustain a product with the highest quality. The team’s job is to ensure we develop the right products up front – evaluate risk, ensure our customer’s user needs are met, and help drive craftsmanship, safety, durability and reliability into the product. On the post-market side, they also work closely with regulatory to handle any complaints and implement design changes, as needed, to address quality issues. The role requires someone who has great communication, problem-solving, and technical skills.


**Research & Development**

*New Product Development*


R&D interns in New Product Development work with cross-functional teams to identify the needs and the goals of future products. They research new technologies, customer expectations, business requirements and regulations. They may work with a variety of tools, including CAD, FEA, and our Test Labs to develop new product concepts. These interns utilize their technical education to design new products and drive them from concept to production.


*Product Engineering*


R&D interns in Product Engineering work with cross-functional teams to identify the greatest needs for improvements on current products. They research new technologies, customer feedback, and product performance data to make our products better for Stryker and for our customers. Product Engineering interns work with a variety of tools, including CAD, FEA, Test Labs, and root cause analysis methods. These interns utilize their technical education to improve the safety and efficacy of our existing products.

 **Test Lab**


Test interns partner closely with Test Engineers and R&D to experiment with early prototypes and vet out product designs throughout the design process. What this really means is that they get to be the MythBusters of the division. You think your design can last the entire expected service life? We put it to the test. Just like the show, we quickly design and build fixtures to simulate real life situations. In addition to these experiments, they are ultimately responsible for design verification – the quantitative testing of the technical specifications of the product. A team’s experience ranges from 2 to over 15 years with technical specialties ranging from sterilization, mechanical, electrical, software, and optics. If you’re the type of person that has the magic ability to break things – we want you!

 **Manufacturing**

Manufacturing Engineer interns will collaborate with Design and Operations to deliver best-in-class new products to market. Interns will partner with technicians and engineers to improve Stryker’s manufacturing lines through new fixture development, assembly line process enhancement, implementation of lean manufacturing principles, and improving ergonomics and safety.

* Apply classroom knowledge and gain experience in a fast-paced and growing industry setting
* Implement new ideas, be constantly challenged, and develop your skills
* Network with key/high-level stakeholders and leaders of the business
* Be a part of an innovative team and culture
* Impact the development and manufacturing of cutting-edge products

**Opportunities Available**  



As a Mechanical Engineering intern at Stryker, you will be placed in one of the following teams:  



**Quality**  



*Advanced Quality*


AQE interns work on engineering projects related to development of new products. Areas of emphasis may include human factors engineering, risk management, application of statistics, reliability engineering, design verification, and design validation including customer interaction. As Homer Stryker pointed out, “If your tools don’t work, make them work. If you can’t make them work, make some that do work.” In this directive, the AQE team works to make sure that the products we develop at Stryker will work consistently for our customers to meet or exceed their expectations.  



*Process Quality*

PQE interns collaborate with cross-functional teams to support product sustainment. When non-conforming issues arise in production, it is our responsibility to perform robust root cause analysis and implement effective corrective actions. Do you enjoy deep dive investigations and driving collaboration and communication to achieve issue resolution? If so, you may be a great fit for this team! PQE interns are focused on quality, compliance and continuous improvement. They use their education to work with a variety of tools including CAD for fixture design, root cause analysis methods, LabView, and validation activities to optimize production, inspection, and quality system processes.

  



*Supplier Quality*

SQE interns are responsible for all things supplier-related. Stryker uses a number of critical suppliers to manufacture components and finished products, and to provide critical services. This team’s job is to work closely with the suppliers to ensure components and their manufacturing processes meet our required standards. Do you enjoy using your technical background and communication skills to influence suppliers? If so, you might be a great fit for this diverse and talented team! The role requires working closely with internal customers from multiple functions, meeting with suppliers frequently, and the use of both technical and business skills.


*Quality*


Quality interns work with our internal cross-functional teams and external sales team and customers to ensure we develop and sustain a product with the highest quality. The team’s job is to ensure we develop the right products up front – evaluate risk, ensure our customer’s user needs are met, and help drive craftsmanship, safety, durability and reliability into the product. On the post-market side, they also work closely with regulatory to handle any complaints and implement design changes, as needed, to address quality issues. The role requires someone who has great communication, problem-solving, and technical skills.


**Research & Development**

*New Product Development*


R&D interns in New Product Development work with cross-functional teams to identify the needs and the goals of future products. They research new technologies, customer expectations, business requirements and regulations. They may work with a variety of tools, including CAD, FEA, and our Test Labs to develop new product concepts. These interns utilize their technical education to design new products and drive them from concept to production.


*Product Engineering*


R&D interns in Product Engineering work with cross-functional teams to identify the greatest needs for improvements on current products. They research new technologies, customer feedback, and product performance data to make our products better for Stryker and for our customers. Product Engineering interns work with a variety of tools, including CAD, FEA, Test Labs, and root cause analysis methods. These interns utilize their technical education to improve the safety and efficacy of our existing products.

 **Test Lab**


Test interns partner closely with Test Engineers and R&D to experiment with early prototypes and vet out product designs throughout the design process. What this really means is that they get to be the MythBusters of the division. You think your design can last the entire expected service life? We put it to the test. Just like the show, we quickly design and build fixtures to simulate real life situations. In addition to these experiments, they are ultimately responsible for design verification – the quantitative testing of the technical specifications of the product. A team’s experience ranges from 2 to over 15 years with technical specialties ranging from sterilization, mechanical, electrical, software, and optics. If you’re the type of person that has the magic ability to break things – we want you!

 **Manufacturing**

  

Manufacturing Engineer interns will collaborate with Design and Operations to deliver best-in-class new products to market. Interns will partner with technicians and engineers to improve Stryker’s manufacturing lines through new fixture development, assembly line process enhancement, implementation of lean manufacturing principles, and improving ergonomics and safety.


Majors targeted: Mechanical Engineering
