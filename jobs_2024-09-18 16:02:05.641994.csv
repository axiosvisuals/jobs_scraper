Immanuel Genius believe that preschool school is an important stepping stone along with the path toward independence. Children gain self-confidence in their first school environment when there is respect for their individual differences in temperament, learning styles, and rates of growth. Children learn from experience. They learn from each other. They learn through play. It takes time.

It is important to us that children like school, and that they see it as a place designed for them to be with friends and to take part in interesting and stimulating activities. Young children are active learners. Through a hands-on play approach, children can explore their environment through their senses and experiences. Our inclusive program focuses on the whole child so that his/her social, emotional, physical, and cognitive needs can be met. Our goal is to create an environment where each child grows to love learning and becomes an active learner.
