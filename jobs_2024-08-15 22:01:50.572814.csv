VOICE Charter School (http://www.voicecharterschool.org/) is an elementary and middle school located in Long Island City, Queens that serves about 650 students across grades K-8. We are located just minutes from Manhattan (two stops outside of Manhattan on the F, N, and W train lines) and Long Island City’s growing waterfront district, thriving arts community, and rapid residential growth. We are looking to identify extraordinary educators and administrators committed to urban education who wish to join a dynamic professional learning community.

Our mission is to create a safe and healthy learning environment that will nurture, motivate and challenge all of our children to achieve the highest level of academic excellence and to develop into mindful, responsible, contributing participants in their education, their community and the diverse society in which we live.

***What makes VOICE different?***

**At VOICE, it’s not just about the music. It’s about the people.** It’s about what you can be. It’s about using your passion. It’s about relationships. It’s about having the opportunity to choose. It’s about caring enough. It’s about each individual child and adult.

**We believe in efficacy.** At the core of our academic culture is the idea that all students are capable of doing well in any discipline. At VOICE, all students will learn – being smart is not something that you are, it is something you become. At VOICE, you will be pushed to become more.

**We promote participation in music and the arts.** As music and art help develop problem solving and critical thinking skills and open children's imaginations, all VOICE students participate in and learn from daily activities in the arts including rigorous choral training. We design our arts-integrated curriculum to bring joy and wonder to the lives of our children, providing them with the skills necessary to forge their own path.

**Who We Are**



EHTP began in 1958 as a children's reading group and has since grown into a multi-site after-school program for traditional public school students. A network of public charter schools focused on significantly increasing the college graduation rate in East Harlem. We are on track to serve at least 25% of East Harlem students by 2025, with enrollment for this year at approximately 2200 students in our schools and after-school programs. In 2020, 99% of our seniors were accepted to college, and our current scholars in college are on track to graduate at eight times the national average of their peers.



At EHTP, we also aim to serve as change agents and thoughtfully contribute to the national fight for racial equity. Through our organization-wide commitment to anti-racism work, we prepare our scholars to effect change, challenge the status quo, and thrive in the world around them. As staff members, we face our own racial identities and conscious and unconscious biases. With this in mind, all of our professional development, curriculum, organizational materials, and processes are designed with the goal of racial justice. Read our racial equity statement **here**.



We ground all of our work in racial equity, **in our core values**, and our four guiding pursuits: the Revolutionary Pursuit of Love, the Radical Pursuit of Knowledge, the Responsive Pursuit of Healing, and in the Relentless Pursuit of Results. These pursuits inform and are reflected in our current four key strategic priorities: to increase high-impact, high-quality academic curriculum, programming content, staff capacity, and coaching; to embrace and advance our use of technology; to deepen our embodiment of ethical and equitable radical humanity; and to efficiently operationalize teaching, learning, community, and care.

* Experience with secondary data, trends, and learnings.
* Experience demonstrating UX Research impact, including driving business and product decisions through UX Research.
* You have worked in close partnership with designers and business units.
* You are adept at managing stakeholders and understanding the orientations and needs of different business functions within a large organization.

The good news is that your training will teach you everything you need to know to succeed on the job. But there are a few skills you should have from the get-go:  

  

* You're a fun and friendly person who values customers and takes absolute pride in everything you do.


- You like talking - a lot - even to strangers (despite what your Mom told you). This is important, because you're not able to text message customers.
  

- You've got attitude - the right kind of course - and understand the need to be on time, all the time. With loads of energy, you understand that work is easier - and more fun - working as a team.

Direct-to-consumer brands pay us, in order to market less.


Well, technically, they pay us to market more effectively. And, strangely (!), that often means marketing a lot less.


How? We use *a lot of math* and *a lot of machine learning* to decide which people on their subscriber lists actually want to hear from them right now.


When you do this, two things happen. Brands save a ton of money. And their deliverability improves, which means they make more money because their emails land in inboxes, not in spam. Cool.


Fewer messages sent + higher chance they will be seen = ROI goes way up.


Sounds simple, right? Well, it’s not. You try getting marketers to be less market-y. It’s way easier to “play it safe” and email everyone all the time. Our math has to be that good.


But you said there would be math. Yes. We said there would be math.


And that’s where you come in. We need people with amazing neural networks in their heads to help our artificial ones do their thing. You’ll be one of the founding members of our engineering team. You’ll have a huge impact on our product, our culture, and building something great from the ground up. It will be a lot of fun.


You will be on a team of engineers, reporting to our CEO Daniel Brady (he has a PhD in Neurobiology and has built data science teams for a decade). We look like a SaaS company, but we’re really building *the* data science and machine learning company to support the world’s best brands. You will work closely with our talented teams to enhance our self-service platform and drive innovation in our product offerings.


We need your help to drive our team's growth and improve our efficiency in task delegation, resource management, and product development. This role will involve overseeing code reviews, addressing development queries, and serving as the primary liaison between engineering and our Founding Product Manager.

**As our Lead Engineer, you will**

* Lead product and feature development efforts, ensuring alignment with business objectives
* Conduct code reviews and provide technical guidance to team members
* Serve as the primary engineering contact for our Founding Product Manager
* Collaborate cross-functionally to integrate new features and enhancements into our self-service platform
* Design, implement, test, deploy, and iterate on end-to-end features in our products covering both frontend and backend
* Create intuitive dashboards and user interfaces, bringing simplicity to complex user needs
* Integrations and APIs oh my: establish data feeds for our ML models and make their outputs take action in the real world
* Produce clean and well-structured code with detailed specifications and documentation
* Help maintain code quality, organization, automation, and continuous delivery

**Your Ideal Background**

***Please apply even if you don’t meet every requirement***

* Proven experience in an engineering leadership role, with a strong track record of managing a team and delivering successful projects
* A versatile builder who has built and maintained a web application from scratch
* 6+ years of industry experience in backend development
* Solid understanding of Python, Flask, SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, React.js
* 5+ years in frontend development - you can translate complex concepts into user-friendly interfaces
* Work experience as the primary engineering point of contact for the product team
* Strong system design fundamentals and experience building scalable systems
* Proven software engineering skills in a production environment, including test-driven development
* Your code is comprehensible, well-structured, and highly performant
* Strong sense of responsibility and ownership and own projects end to end with a bias for solving problems and shipping impactful features into production that are well tested (unit & end-to-end)
* Strong analytical and problem-solving skills

**Bonus points for experience in the following:**

* Experience building data-intensive applications
* Previous CTO of a startup or Founding Engineer experience

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/U--haul","http://www.uhaul.com/","2727 North Central Avenue

**About Hook & Reel**

Born in the South where a feast means getting messy with friends, the seafood boil has been bringing people together for ages. At Hook & Reel our signature boil forks over bold flavors with a genuine, down-home feel.

Everything tastes better elbow-to-elbow with friends, swapping stories over music, getting down and dirty and eating with your hands – all with a cold drink at the ready, ‘cause that spice ain’t no joke. We set out to share the saucy spirit of the boil with folks everywhere – testing our very own recipes, inspired by fiery Cajun home cooking. The Hook & Reel seafood boil dishes up the “reel” deal – the full backyard boil experience and flavor, with a twist.

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/U--haul","http://www.uhaul.com/","2727 North Central Avenue
