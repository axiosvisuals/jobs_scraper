Seton Education Partners seeks a mission-driven, results-oriented individual to serve as Recruitment Associate for the Seton Teaching Fellows Program. Recruitment Associates (RAs) grow and strengthen our talent pipeline by sourcing and engaging top individuals to join our organization. As a Recruitment Associate, you will build strategic candidate pipelines for our recruitment campaigns, identify and engage top prospects and inspire a broad network of constituents, helping to build a large and talented pipeline of candidates.

**Background**


Co-founded in 2009 by KIPP pioneer Scott W. Hamilton and Teach for America alumna Stephanie Saroki de García, Seton Education Partners expands opportunities for parents in underserved communities to choose an academically excellent, character-rich, and—for those who seek it—vibrantly Catholic education for their children. As a national non-profit, Seton partners with (arch)dioceses and others across the country to implement innovative and sustainable new schooling models that bridge the best of Catholic education’s rich tradition with new possibilities. The challenges are significant but surmountable with collaboration from a mission-driven, high-performing, entrepreneurial team that embraces innovation and is motivated to reach thousands of children in America’s most underserved neighborhoods. For more information on Seton Education Partners, please visit www.SetonPartners.org.

**About Seton Teaching Fellows**


Seton Teaching Fellows accompanies, develops, and challenges young Catholics to serve students, families, and each other by imitating the love of Christ the Teacher in underserved communities and beyond.


Seton Teaching Fellows is a one or two-year postgraduate mission opportunity that brings the living Gospel and the beauty of the Catholic faith to children and families in underserved communities. Fellows rely on both time-tested and innovative methods that help the children and families they serve, as well as their peers, to better know, love, and serve Christ and His Church. At the same time, they participate in their own spiritual formation by developing the habits, dispositions, and beliefs indispensable to human flourishing and happiness.


Three pillars drive the program: Faith, Education and Community

#### **Faith**: Fellows grow spiritually in their faith through weekly formation, prayer and reflection, retreats, and the Sacraments. In turn, they catechize children in the Catholic faith and prepare them for their Sacraments.

**Education**: Fellows learn how to become strong educators in a supportive learning community at a Seton network school. Fellows receive continuous professional development in how to be an outstanding teacher.

**Community:** Fellows live in the neighborhood of their placement school, alongside the children and families they serve. Grounded in an intentional, faith-based community of mission-driven peers, Fellows learn how to live for the other. Housing and a modest stipend are provided.

**Qualifications and Desired Characteristics**
