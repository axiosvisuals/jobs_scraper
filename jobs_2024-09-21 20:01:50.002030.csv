This will be a part-time opportunity to start, but can transition into a full-time position quickly. It will be a remote working arrangement, with some time flexibility (during the p/t beginning phase).

**The Organization / Product**

***Productori*** represents a new paradigm in staff training for retail stores.

Unlike all other staff training software that is focused mainly on HR related content; ***Productori’s*** main focus is on training staff on the products they sell.

We achieve this by integrating the products that the store sells with a unique 5-step training process that allows staff to:

* Memorize the details of the products they sell
* Then apply that knowledge in simulated, customer interaction scenarios, just like they will face everyday in their job.

Including:

* A brand new approach to product memorization tools
* An arcade of learning/memorization games; including a new gamification genre that not only teaches, but is also fascinating to play
* A first of its kind, Customer Simulator; that utilizes AI-Generated simulations of the store, with customer avatars asking the same questions staff will face at work (similar to a flight simulator used by pilots, or a ‘halo-deck’)

**The Job:**

To start, you will be assisting the CEO/Founder of ***Productori*** in all aspects of product development & management in an early-stage software company. So, you will be involved with a little bit of everything (and wearing many hats) related to software product management / development and UX-design.

This will include helping to coordinate internal and external professionals within product development functions: Content, UX, UI Design, and Software Engineering.

You will also be assisting in UX Design & Product Feature Development via our High-Fidelity Figma Prototypes; and helping to prepare parts of the prototype for hand-off to UI Designers and Software Engineers.

So you will be working extensively with ‘Figma’ prototyping software; while you do not need to be an expert in Figma, you will need a solid foundation

Software coding will not be required for this position, but you will need to be able to communicate with Software Engineers. However, if you do have a foundation in web-based / PWA coding, there may be additional software engineering opportunities.

While we are still a pre-launch startup, we are in the ‘last-mile’ push to launching in 1st Quarter 2025.

So even though this position will start off as a part-time position, there will be opportunities to progress into a full time role rather quickly; either continuing in a product management role, or a parallel move into related roles within Product Development.

This will be a hybrid position (but mostly remote), and some degree of time flexibility (while it’s still part-time).

The compensation will be $20-$25 per hour, to start, depending on skill set & experience.

We realize that this initial compensation may be lower than current market rates for a Product Development Assistant. However, if you can hang in there for just a little while; your compensation will increase quickly, and you can find yourself on the ground-floor of a new startup, operating in a business space that is consistently ranked as one of the most promising & profitable segments of AI-powered software.

**Apply:**

Please include your resume and any links to websites, profiles, portfolios, etc.. that might be relevant.

Also feel free to include an optional short cover letter as to why you would be a good fit for this role, and a team member of ***Productori.***

Welcome to the salon! As the first person all of our guests will see, we are looking for a positive, professional, friendly and competent person, who perfectly represents our diverse little corner of the world!

First, a little intro to us: We are a ten+ year salon, with a staff of thirteen other women. Every one of us has our own personality, interests and the stylists, a unique style and clientele. The atmosphere is fun, non competitive, non dramatic, and busy!

We are looking for someone to join our team who is excited to work Mondays & Saturdays. On Mondays, we are looking for 12:30-3:00 where the salon is still closed, to open up after being closed on Sunday. On Saturdays, we open at 8, which makes start time 7:30 am, and we close at 3:00, putting you out of the salon by 3:20pm most Saturdays. The rest of the week we can be a little flexible on, so long as our Saturday need is met.

The responsibilities are prioritized, firstly in customer service:

* greeting clients as they walk through the door, checking them into a computer, making coffee/tea/water. Giving them an indication of where they will be heading next, and in how long.
* Alerting stylists to the arrival of their clients
* checking them out at completion of their services (cash handling, booking future appointments through our Vagaro software).
* Answering phones and booking appointments while considering the policies we have in place and also providing excellent customer service by addressing client inquiries and concerns

These are the most important duties, but we also need a little cleaning and behind the scenes work:

* towels and capes washed, dried, folded and put in the cabinets
* color bowls and brushes washed, dried and put away
* floors swept after every haircut
* wiping down chairs, stations and sinks
* Maintain a clean and organized reception area

Some helpful skills to have, and other things to know would be:

Skills:  
- Strong customer service skills with the ability to provide personalized attention to clients (MANDATORY)  
- Excellent communication skills, both verbal and written  
- Knowledge of phone etiquette and professional communication techniques  
- Familiarity with technology sales, such as point-of-sale systems or online booking platforms  
- Multi-tasking abilities, especially when something unexpected pops up  
- Organization to help remember policies, open inquiries and client expectation

Add'l Info:

-Professional dress code ( not specific, but no flips flops, butts, boobs, or bellies within reason, no gym pants, gym sneakers or plain flip flops)  
- Hair and make-up on point to your unique style  
- Please leave your drama in your car. If anything comes up, talk to us. We are humans, some of us moms. We believe in mental health, an awesome atmosphere for all, and staying up front and honest. If you need a day, we will accommodate, but need as much notice as possible!  
- We have a few other receptionists to cover shifts if needed, or who may ask you to cover a shift making hours more available.  
- You'll get the perks of very discounted hair services! ( we have extensions!)  
- closed Sundays forever and always  
- staff considers each and every co-worker part of a family <3

Please reach out with any questions! Please apply if this sounds interesting to you!!
