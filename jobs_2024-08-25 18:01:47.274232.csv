**Crowe Healthcare Consulting is now Kodiak Solutions!**


This is an exciting time to join our growing Kodiak Solutions team! Recently, Crowe LLP reached a decision to divest its Crowe Healthcare Consulting practice, now Kodiak, in a sale to TPG, a global asset management firm that will be the perfect partner to take Kodiak to the next level. The story around Kodiak is an impressive one. Derek Bang, the practice founder and inventor of the group’s flagship software product for net revenue reporting, Revenue Cycle Analytics (RCA) came to Crowe nearly 20 years ago with an idea for a strategic pursuit in the Healthcare Industry through his previous experience as a Healthcare Auditor at a Big 4 firm. Crowe invested in the idea, providing the resources and support necessary to launch the RCA product and organically grow the practice to its current state, now offering a broad suite of software and services that help healthcare CFOs solve challenges across financial reporting, revenue cycle, and risk and compliance. Kodiak currently services more than 1,800 hospitals and 200,000 practice-based physicians across all 50 states. Due to the unique complexities of the business such as technology and data security, it is time for a new partner with the appropriate expertise and resources to invest in the future growth of Kodiak. The transaction will enable Kodiak to operate with greater flexibility and focus, positioning it to accelerate growth and expand its technology portfolio to better serve healthcare provider organizations across the county.


At Kodiak you have the opportunity to deliver innovative solutions to today’s complex business issues facing the Healthcare industry. Kodiak personnel are widely recognized for their in-depth Healthcare expertise and application of data and technology to simplify the business of Healthcare for thousands of hospitals nationwide.
