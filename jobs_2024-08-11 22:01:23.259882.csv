What part will you play?
  
  

An Associate Project Manager (APM) is an entry level position responsible for the scope, schedule, cost, quality and client satisfaction of a project throughout its entire lifecycle, from Initiating through Closing phases. The APM depends on the help of other people to perform most of the actual activities of the project and relies on other PM’s and Tech Ops Directors for close supervision and training. A project managers role is primarily focused around written and verbal communication to all project stakeholders.
  
  

The APM is responsible for assisting in performing project management functions for all projects, budgets and scopes. The Associate Project Manager is an entry level position and will work under the close guidance and supervision of the Tech Ops Director and other more Senior Project Managers. The APM may seek assistance and guidance from more senior personnel to address complex or new issues and remove roadblocks. The APM will usually be part of the PM team on larger projects.
  
  

What will you be doing?
  
  

Daily activities include project communications, scheduling, task lists for technicians, managing deliverables from engineering, CAD and Programming and overseeing the completion of projects. The PM is responsible for completing systems integration projects on time, on budget and achieving high customer satisfaction from our customers. The majority of this employee's time will be spent managing projects and communicating with all project stakeholders. This person will be held accountable for following and helping to improve the established Diversified processes. Under the direction of more senior personnel the APM develops a strong long-term relationship. They manage the client relationship, including expectations, communications and satisfaction.
  
  

* Coordinates and communicates.
* Provides accurate and timely written and verbal communication
* Ensures appropriate and frequent communication between stakeholders
* Coordinates all activities associated with the timely, accurate and on-budget completion of the project, including engaging stakeholders, delegating responsibilities clearly and running client and internal project meetings
* Coordinates with other internal and external personnel to solve work assignments
* Establishes and maintains communication with Account Executives, Directors, installation technicians, subcontractors, clients, etc.
* Develops and communicates project updates as required.
* Designs, plans, and coordinates work teams with regard to Workplace installation projects
* Receives support and assistance from team members as needed in order help them be successful and get the job done
* Resolves destructive conflict and seeks support as necessary

**Complexity:** Every project is different, and project stakeholders are different. The PM needs to negotiate a very complex set of variables between system design, site conditions and a widely varying set of expectations with multiple stakeholders. The skill of communicating both verbally and in writing to manage all these variables takes a very high level of awareness, emotional intelligence and people management skills. The PM is constantly managing the forces of change in every project environment. Balancing schedules, budgets, scope, quality and client satisfaction are a very complex set of variables. The Associate PM is likely to be assigned fewer complex projects and assist other PM’s with more complex projects.
  
  

**Decision Making Authority:**  

* Takes full ownership of project
* Acts as the single point of responsibility and accountability for the project and escalates issues quickly as they arise to keep the project on track.
* Ensures schedule performance, quality of solution delivered to client, and client satisfaction.
* Manages and reports on the project’s financials, including ensuring budget performance and profitability. Ensures timely and correct billings to client.
* Demonstrates proactivity, responsiveness, and follow through.
* Communicates decision options to stakeholders and assists in managing those decisions.
* Facilitates and tracks a complex array of decisions at every point of the project but is rarely the sole decision maker.
