**Facultative Reinsurance Overview**

Facultative Reinsurance is insurance for insurance companies. Carriers buy reinsurance to protect their balance sheets against the impact of large or accumulating losses or specific exposures that are outside their risk appetite. Facultative reinsurance can match the terms of the original insurance policy exactly. Or it can transfer a part of the risk, such as a single location, sub-limit or deductible. Facultative reinsurance can help deliver insurance programs and placements by managing elements of risk that would otherwise make placements difficult. It can give an insurer confidence that they can accept a particular risk outside their appetite, knowing they can protect themselves from the impact of any losses. We bring a one WTW client-centric approach, working with cedants and clients to create innovative structures that deliver the best placement for clients, backed by data and risk analytics.

**Affinity Overview**

WTW Affinity is a global line of business which provides end-to-end Affinity insurance solutions for organizations whose core business is not insurance. Affinity is a B2B2C/B2B2B/B2C line of business, which means the insureds will be our clients’ end-customers. Our Affinity strategy places a focus on prospects that are global in nature, have multi-country clients, and have a mass volume customer base. The current target industry segments are car dealers and manufacturers, energy utilities, financial services, and mobile network operators. A role in affinity is suited to individuals who have an interest in building sales and marketing platforms for distribution of products and services in addition to the broking/ placement of the insurance. As a b2b2b/ b2b2c business, the affinity model is highly process driven and is much more centered around business building with the client on an ongoing basis as opposed to purely risk transfer or a transaction. Affinity cuts across many industries as a process discipline and therefore requires someone with creativity and the ability to structure solutions in the context of ambiguity.

**The Business.**

**Graduate Program Overview**

The CRB Graduate Development Program (GDP) is a non-rotational two-year-program that provides the opportunity to develop a broad knowledge base, varied skills, and diverse network. This program is designed to set you up with a holistic view of CRB with hands-on experience, insight, and opportunities to make an impact and shape your own career.

**Facultative Reinsurance Overview**

Facultative Reinsurance is insurance for insurance companies. Carriers buy reinsurance to protect their balance sheets against the impact of large or accumulating losses or specific exposures that are outside their risk appetite. Facultative reinsurance can match the terms of the original insurance policy exactly. Or it can transfer a part of the risk, such as a single location, sub-limit or deductible. Facultative reinsurance can help deliver insurance programs and placements by managing elements of risk that would otherwise make placements difficult. It can give an insurer confidence that they can accept a particular risk outside their appetite, knowing they can protect themselves from the impact of any losses. We bring a one WTW client-centric approach, working with cedants and clients to create innovative structures that deliver the best placement for clients, backed by data and risk analytics.

**Broking Placement Overview**

WTW’s Broking teams deliver superior results for our clients’ business and risk management needs through deep industry specific expertise. The role of a broker is to help our clients mitigate their total cost of risk. The brokerage team operates as the firm’s intellectual capital where we work with our clients to assess, model, and structure risk. Once modeled, the broker personally escorts the clients’ risk into the market and draws upon their market relationships and their negotiation skills to secure quotations from the insurance carriers. While the nature of the work is similar day-to-day, no two placements are the same and common tasks may include: preparing and sending out submissions, liaising with markets, analyzing exposures, working through risk models, and negotiating quotations.
