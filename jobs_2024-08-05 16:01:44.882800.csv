Do you really, really love dogs? Do you want to make money doing something you love? If so, please continue reading! We are a top dog walking company looking to add an awesome new team member or two to our ranks for our pup clients in the following areas of Manhattan: Upper East Side and Midtown East.

**About Us:** Founded in 2010, we are one of NYC’s largest premier solo dog walking companies, meaning we only walk one dog at a time, with the exception of multiple dog households. We send the same walkers to the same pups daily, which means our staff form trusting and loving bonds with their pup clients. Because of this, we are looking for dog lovers who have an interest in longevity with our team - \\*\\*9 months minimum\\*\\* although we do have walkers who have been with us for years. If you're looking for a short-term gig, this isn't the right job for you; both our human and dog clients love forming relationships with their walkers and don't do well with frequent turnover.

**About You:** You are reliable, punctual, communicative, and have a strong work ethic. You are a bonafide dog lover with experience caring for dogs throughout your lifetime. While you do not need to have any prior professional experience walking dogs for this position, we do prefer to hire people who have experience and comfort with dogs of ALL sizes.

**You \\*MUST\\* have minimum daily availability Monday – Friday from 11am – 4pm (sorry, this isn’t negotiable)**.

You are a self-starter who can work on your own with micromanagement. You are not afraid of NYC weather conditions, which aren’t great a lot of the time, but you’re with pups which is great all the time!

**About the Position:** Our standard schedule runs Monday - Friday from 11am - 4pm, and we always have extra work available outside these hours for those interested. While our pay is calculated by walk, our average walkers make $19-$22 per hour, with our top staff earning $22++ per hour. Our staff members are employees of the company and not independent contractors. We pay weekly via direct deposit, so paper paychecks are a thing of the past. After 6 months with the team, we offer 40 hours of PTO per year. We’re passionate about hiring great people and even more passionate about keeping our top dogs with the team.

To apply for this position, please set yourself apart from the pack by telling us all about you (the more detail, the better)!

- What's your name?  
- When are you free to start?  
- What's your experience with dogs? Please be as detailed and specific as possible.  
- Are you legally able to work in the United States? Sorry, all of our pay is on the books!  
- Are you free daily Monday - Friday from 11am - 4pm?  
- Can you make a minimum 9-month commitment to our team?  
- If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?

We can't wait to hear from you!! WOOF!

* Good organizational skills
* Effective communication skills

**About our tinkering clubs** 

We got off the ground a year ago with tinkering clubs for young kids. The focus is on leveraging design thinking, engineering, technology and art to create projects that are fun, interactive and reflect the personalities of the creators

* Each tinkering club or camp has a theme or a prompt. (past themes have included a carnival, modes of transportation, holiday windows)
* Students build prototypes using recyclable materials (primarily cardboard) and then add electronic components and sensors to make their creations come alive. We use microcontrollers to control the electronics and learn to write code for the microcontroller.
* We also use modern fabrication tools like laser cutters and 3D printers to add functional and design elements for our projects.
* We don’t rely on kits (e.g. LEGO, Vex Robotics etc.) for our curriculum…because we like the creativity and learning that emerges from open-ended prompts and using the resources available at our disposal.
* Students work on their projects over several sessions. They think about how end-users will interact with their project, what functionality to include and how the project will reflect their own personality. Often, they will come up with ideas on how everyone’s project relates to each other to form a story.
* Students learn skills like electronics and coding in an intuitive way because it is part of the project and necessary to make their project functional.
* They also learn soft skills like communication and collaboration while using shared tools and teaching/helping others on their projects.

The Osborne Association serves individuals, families, and communities affected by the criminal legal system. Through our programs, we offer opportunities for people to heal from the harm they have suffered, repair damage they have endured, restore their lives, and thrive. We challenge systems rooted in racism and retribution and fight for policies and practices that promote true safety, justice, and liberation.


At Osborne, we are guided by core values and shared beliefs.

For 30+ years, at the request of their court-appointed attorneys, Osborne’s Court Advocacy Services (CAS) team has assisted individuals facing open criminal cases in the NYS Supreme Court in all five boroughs of NYC. We are expanding this defense-based court advocacy and mitigation services to Westchester, Rensselaer, Columbia, and Greene Counties. We conduct pre-plea/pre-sentence investigations to ascertain mitigating circumstances, when appropriate, to advocate for client-specific sentencing alternatives, including treatment and other types of community-based programming. In recent years, we began assisting individuals facing certain parole violations, conducting bail advocacy for women in detention, providing direct services to individuals involved in intimate partner violence in the Bronx, and a diversion to those facing low-level charges in Manhattan through Project Reset.
