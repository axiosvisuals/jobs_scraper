--------------



The Farmer's Dog is the fastest growing pet health service company in the US, and was born from a mission to change the landscape of pet health, providing dogs and their humans with honest, smart, and simple care – a fresh proposition in an industry riddled with manipulative and misleading marketing. We're starting by radically improving the $100 billion pet food market, replacing bulk bags of highly-processed pellets with a personalized subscription service that sends healthy, freshly-made dog food, balanced by top veterinary nutritionists, directly to customers' doors. Our ultimate goal is to create innovative, honest, and delightful experiences across all aspects of pet care, and we believe our direct-to-consumer business model, holistic approach to growth, and dynamic and forward-thinking culture uniquely position us to shepherd this backwards industry into the future.



To date, The Farmer's Dog has delivered hundreds of millions of meals nationwide and raised over $150M in funding to help us build a company as healthy as the dogs who are eating those meals. Join us as we continue to develop ways of bringing peace of mind to our customers, health to their companions, and much-needed change to the way people feed and care for their pets.



#LongLiveDogs


**What We Stand For**
---------------------



We have big ambitions, our mission is to give dog lovers true peace of mind by helping them do the best for their dogs – this will require us to completely reimagine how we care for our dogs and drive meaningful shifts in an industry that is desperate for change. We don't believe this is possible by implementing ""best practices"" or operating how the rest of the industry operates.


**One Team:** We don't think of ourselves as ""Marketers"", ""Engineers"", ""Data Analysts"", or ""Product Managers"". Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we don't think departments matter. We'd rather align ourselves to the goals we're working to achieve and make sure we have the necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER – getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms to solve problems holistically.


**We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing:** Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we aren't tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know there's a better or more impactful way to solve problems.


**We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions:** We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is. We ensure our strategy sets customers up for success and drives long-term retention. We answer questions and address problems early and proactively.


**We execute for impact:** We're uninterested in how we compare to ""benchmarks""; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we don't subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles – i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience.


**We are focused and work without assumption**: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, ""what's the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?"". We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly. We don't expect to be perfect the first time.


**Where You'll Come In**
------------------------

* **Industry & Authority Building:** You'll position The Farmer's Dog as the authoritative source on dog health. Ensure all content is SEO-optimized and aligned with target keywords.

Douglaston Development, Levine Builders, and Clinton Management are a dynamic privately held group of companies with a unique owner-builder-manager advantage, known collectively as The Douglaston Companies.

The Douglaston Companies started with the founding of Levine Builders in 1979 with just two people. Standing by our core values of integrity and ethics for the past four decades the firm has grown to 200 employees. By providing general contracting and construction management services, Levine Builders has built, renovated and rehabilitated thousands of residential units and millions of square feet of commercial, hotel, office buildings, retail centers, religious, educational, and healthcare facilities.

With the later establishment of Douglaston Development as the driving engine of the organization, the two companies worked in unison to leverage each others expertise to develop and build most complex projects while also growing and thriving in challenging markets.

In 2002, Clinton Management was founded to manage the expanding portfolio of developments created by Douglaston Development and constructed by Levine Builders. Clinton Management oversees a broad portfolio of moderate-income housing, luxury apartments, commercial, and retail properties.

Each affiliate company works together to cohesively acquire property, develop it to its full potential, and manage it efficiently, assuring that each investment achieves and maintains maximum value and profitability while strengthening the community in which the assets are located.

Darkhorse Tech provides comprehensive Dental-Specific IT services to our clients including ongoing support (Managed Services), startup projects & expansions (planning, design, buildouts) as well as software & hardware sales and maintenance.

As a leader in the industry, we have created and continue to foster relationships with all leading-edge technology companies servicing the Dental community. Our company was created by founder and CEO, Reuben Kamp who left his job at a nationwide Dental IT company to build a relationship-focused version of a Managed Service Provider (MSP) which creates true partnerships with its clients.

Constantly building on our 10+ years of experience we are now servicing roughly 1000 clients in all 50 states and continue to see massive growth while focusing on maintaining unparalleled support for our Dental Practice partners. With technicians on the ground throughout the country we offer in-person as well as remote support.

**About You**

Service first. Providing exemplary service means recognizing it. Have you put off a call to your cell phone company because the idea of waiting on hold, requesting a manager only to fight for a solution seems exhausting? Have you ever been pleasantly surprised by a service organization where your call is addressed efficiently, with care and acknowledgement that you are their top priority because you (as a client) are the lifeblood of their business? There is a huge difference in these approaches, and the latter builds loyalty and trust which is vital to the health of any business.

You are solution-oriented and accountable. When given an opportunity to address an issue you follow service standards and quickly provide a solution, if you can’t you are able to escalate the issue and alert your manager to your need/want for knowledge and growth - all while communicating progress in a professional and engaging manner with the client.

Part of our team! While service tickets are addressed individually our crew is always ready to support one another, you will both receive and provide help as we are all working toward the same goal. Together we provide a level of service that our clients dream of and that we stand behind.

**What does it take to be successful at Darkhorse Tech? Here's what our employees have to say!**

* Communication. If you're having trouble you need to let someone know.
* It may seem counterintuitive, but slowing down to read what's in front of you and take note of what you're doing. Some techs might rush but that's when things get missed or overlooked.
* I always view work ethic as the biggest thing - if you're willing to do the work you'll be successful here. Knowledge is a smaller component but also important, and knowing where to find answers, having critical thought, and patience.
* The ability to change gears rapidly.
* There's a difference between coming to work and dedicating your time to work. To be successful you need to dedicate the time that you're here to doing the most for our clients and for us.
* Asking a bunch of questions, becoming comfortable enough to ask for help in the chat. I had to learn that myself because I tend not to ask for help but I found that once I reach out more I become more efficient and I learn a lot quicker. Don’t be afraid to use your resources. Some of the senior techs are amazing.
* Being organized and above all good customer service because that's our reputation. Also good writing skills and knowing how to talk to people - communicating effectively.
* You have to be a self-initiator. You have to be willing to own tasks that could potentially be outside of your job description to prove that you're capable of taking on more. And you have to be patient.
* You have to be willing to adapt. We've made some necessary changes here and the big thing is being able to adapt to them. We're putting in a lot of processes that help the company, like AGILE for example, and I think those changes have been for the better.
* The desire to progress and grow.
* An eye for detail and knowing how to manage client expectations.

In 2024, CFR will expand our family defense practice to Richmond County. CFR was originally founded in 2002 to dramatically change the trajectory of indigent parents being prosecuted by the Citys Administration for Childrens Services (ACS). Our goal is to defend and protect our clients rights, reduce the harm of family separation and prevent or minimize the time any child spends in the foster system.


CFR provides interdisciplinary family defense with a model that was unique at our founding and that is now being replicated nationally: we assign every client an attorney and a social work staff member, and teams have the support of parent advocates, who are parents with direct personal experience of being investigated and prosecuted by ACS. CFR was the first agency in the country to integrate parents with lived experience into legal teams and now has 7 parent advocates working in all three of our family defense locations. CFRsCommunity Advocacy Projectrepresents parents during a child protective investigation (to avoid court involvement where possible) and assists parents in clearing their names from state maltreatment records.


As an agency committed to securing justice for families, we built theYouth Defense practice (YDP)to defend youth at risk of family separation through incarceration. YDP uses the same interdisciplinary model to represent youth being prosecuted in Queens and Manhattan in Supreme Court Youth Parts, during Probation Adjustment and in Delinquency proceedings in Family Court. CFRs Home for Good program provides legal and social work services to CFR clients inimmigration,civil legal servicesandcriminal defensematters, to afford clients an efficient and well-coordinated one-stop solution to a range of issues that threaten family stability.


Recognized as experts in our fields,we annually train over 500 practitioners in the city, state and around the countryon strategies to promote family preservation and interdisciplinary representation, and we provide community based Know Your Rights presentations to parents, youth and service providers.We advocate at the city, state and national level for policies that reduce the harm of family separation, and promote parent engagement and justice for youth and families.

**Location:** Pine Brook, NJ

**Schedule:** Part time, 15 hours/week 2pm-7pm, Wednesday, Thursday & Friday

**Length:** Long term (minimum 1 year commitment)

**Start date:** ASAP

**Pay:** $30**-**$33/hour depending on experience

**Benefits:**  
-2 work weeks of vacation (1 of family’s choosing, 1 of nanny’s)  
-1 work week of sick/personal days

**Family Values:**   
This kind and generous family prioritizes their children’s comfort and happiness. From the parents: “We want our children to be relaxed and feel safe.” Their household focuses on a combination of following schedules closely while supporting the children’s hobbies and interests as they grow. One reason that this family is excited to have a nanny is to get the children on an earlier schedule (currently they are starting dinner at 7pm because both parents work); this family is looking for a nanny who can really come in and take charge of the children’s afternoon based on what is best for them.

**About the children:** 

* **Child A** (4 year old): High energy, joyful child who loves music (turn on some 80’s music videos and he will dance his heart out!). If things are made fun (eating, putting away toys, bathing) that helps him to accomplish things throughout his afternoon/evening. He is a very picky eater who avoids vegetables and can be tough to feed.
* **Child B** (1 year old): Curious child who loves interacting and snuggling with warm and loving caregivers. She loves experimenting with different textures (very hands on), and someone who is excited to engage all of her senses will be a wonderful fit.

**Ideal personality (of Nanny):**   
You are a warm, sociable individual who is comfortable implementing a schedule for toddlers, and maintaining it. Because you will be caring for the children after they return from preschool (from 3:30pm-7pm), you will be primarily responsible for their nutrition, hygiene, play and bedtime routine. You should be comfortable with following a close schedule while maintaining a loving and gentle demeanor.

**Requirements:**

* Clean driving record
* Personal vehicle (nanny will of course be reimbursed at the standard rate of 65.5 cents per mile driven while working)
* Willing to obtain the annual flu shot; up to date on Covid-19 vaccination
* Comfortable with dogs
* Experience caring for multiple toddlers simultaneously

**Responsibilities:**

* Support family in the introduction of an earlier, more child-oriented schedule. The ideal scenario, ultimately, is that parents come home from work in the evening and the children are fed, in PJs and ready to spend time with the parents.
* Loving and attentive care of children, including the meeting of all basic needs (diapering, pottying, bathing, feeding, etc.)
* Daily preparation of dinner for children when you arrive at the house (you will be child-free for 1.5 hours). Family will provide you with groceries, and you will prepare simple, fresh daily meals for the children to eat for dinner.

At Charles Tyrwhitt our purpose is to “Make it easy for men to dress well” and we can’t do that without our team members. At this time, we’re on the lookout for an experienced Sales Associate who will be working with Arthur from our 6th Ave store location.

**What you will be doing**


You will be responsible for providing exceptional customer service and be the touch point for each and every customer. Our Sales Associates will be provided training to support our clients with styling and fit advice, as well as tailoring and custom product sales service. Your natural interest in providing exceptional service will mean you always put the customer first, providing a warm welcome to our shop, always representing the CT Brand.

**What we are looking for**


We are looking for a confident Sales Associate who can connect with our customers, deliver excellence in customer experience, and offer advice on current trends relevant to our clientele. Previous experience in a similar position is a huge advantage to this role. Interest in menswear is necessary, plus training is provided to help you understand our brand.

**What you can expect from us**


CT is a privately-owned business, so we're not a big corporate-style place to work. Our senior leaders are transparent and approachable, and we welcome ideas to make this a great place to work. We value our people whilst being product and customer obsessed.

* Quarterly bonus based on team sales performance
* Part-time paid sick leave!
* Uniform allowance
* PayActiv partnership - get wages already earned before payday
* Employee discount

  

This is an hourly (non-exempt) role based in New York City. The pay range for this role is based on experience and we might reasonably expect to offer $17.00 - $18.50 per hour.

**Who we are**


Once upon a shirt, Nicholas Charles Tyrwhitt Wheeler had the notion that he could make a better shirt at better value than anyone else in the world! He believed that all men; no matter their shape or size, where they may be in the world or indeed their budget; should be able to own a Jermyn Street quality shirt. A proper shirt. A CT shirt.


That was over 3 decades ago and whilst Charles Tyrwhitt (it rhymes with spirit by the way) is still famous for proper shirts, these days we are about so much more than collars and cuffs. Our purpose is to “make it easy for men to dress well”. We take care of the entire wardrobe, providing stylish solutions for every occasion. We make sure he gets what he wants, when and how he wants it.


Charles Tyrwhitt’s spiritual home and flagship store is located on London’s Jermyn Street, in the United Kingdom where our presence is well know. We also have a strong online presence in the US, with retail stores in 7 states and a New York head office. We also operate across Europe and Australia! Pretty impressive, eh? And as of 2022, we're proud to be recognized as a carbon-neutral retailer as we continue our journey to be a sustainable business.
