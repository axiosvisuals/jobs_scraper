* *Customized care*: Our experts review all test results and write reports in a clear, concise, and personalized way. We also include information for research studies in specific clinical situations.
* *Impactful discovery*: Our researchers continue working to find answers even after testing is complete.

KKR & Co. Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is a leading global investment firm that offers alternative asset management and capital markets and insurance solutions. KKR aims to generate attractive investment returns by following a patient and disciplined investment approach, employing world-class people, and supporting growth in its portfolio companies and communities. KKR sponsors investment funds that invest in private equity, credit and real assets and has strategic partners that manage hedge funds. KKR’s insurance subsidiaries offer retirement, life and reinsurance products under the management of The Global Atlantic Financial Group.


**KKR CAPSTONE OVERVIEW**



KKR Capstone is KKR’s value creation group and a unique “CEO University” for talented professionals. It gives high-performing candidates the opportunity to drive real operating change and value generation in a private equity environment, gaining valuable experience as general managers. KKR Capstone executives are expected to take ownership of key priorities and initiatives at the portfolio company, are held accountable for individual results, and are typically the primary agents of change within the organization. Team members can rise within KKR Capstone, transition into opportunities within the broader KKR firm, or take senior operating roles inside or outside the KKR portfolio. Due to the hands-on operating experience KKR Capstone executives gain, ~70% of alums who have left the team in the past decade are now C-suite execs, and more than 1/3 are CEOs.



KKR Capstone’s mission is to deliver exceptional returns on KKR’s investments by partnering with management teams to drive value in KKR portfolio companies, as well as integrating within deal teams to select the right assets. At portfolio companies, KKR Capstone drives the most important operational issues on the CEO and Board of Directors’ agendas, including top-line growth, cost optimization, organizational structure and capability, capital investment, and strategic M&A initiatives. During due diligence, KKR Capstone joins deal teams in evaluating potential acquisitions, including weighing in on crucial operational issues and value creation levers, assessing the target company’s market, and understanding the strength of the company’s position in the industry.



On a day-to-day basis, KKR Capstone executives interact with a broad range of company personnel including the Board, C-suite and line-level operators. The majority of KKR Capstone team members have previous experience in management consulting. While the executives heavily leverage the skills and experience gained in consulting, they spend the bulk of their time identifying, rapidly prototyping, and executing operational improvement initiatives (i.e. less time spent on PowerPoint and more time dealing with general management challenges).


**PRIMARY QUALIFICATIONS AND SKILLS**


* 2-4+ years of management consulting experience at a top consulting firm is preferred
* Operating experience is a plus, but not required (e.g., Start-Up or Corporate work experience)
* Ideal candidates have a genuine enthusiasm and curiosity for Private Equity & Alternative Assets investing, a strong understanding of fundamental business analysis, and an outstanding professional and academic performance record (e.g., top tier performance ratings, early promotions, top class rankings)
* Candidates must embody KKR’s core values, in particular: unquestioned integrity, a strong work ethic, and a commitment to teamwork and excellence

(CFR)is an award-winning, innovative law and policy organization that serves primarily Black and Brown families and youth in Queens, Manhattan, and the Bronx with an interdisciplinary legal defense model that serves more than 2400 clients every year. In 2024, CFR will expand our family defense practice to Richmond County. CFR was originally founded in 2002 to dramatically change the trajectory of indigent parents being prosecuted by the Citys Administration for Childrens Services (ACS). Our goal is to defend and protect our clients rights, reduce the harm of family separation and prevent or minimize the time any child spends in the foster system.


CFR provides interdisciplinary family defense with a model that was unique at our founding and that is now being replicated nationally: we assign every client an attorney and a social work staff member, and teams have the support of parent advocates, who are parents with direct personal experience of being investigated and prosecuted by ACS. CFR was the first agency in the country to integrate parents with lived experience into legal teams and now has 7 parent advocates working in all three of our family defense locations. CFRsCommunity Advocacy Projectrepresents parents during a child protective investigation (to avoid court involvement where possible) and assists parents in clearing their names from state maltreatment records.


As an agency committed to securing justice for families, we built theYouth Defense practice (YDP)to defend youth at risk of family separation through incarceration. YDP uses the same interdisciplinary model to represent youth being prosecuted in Queens and Manhattan in Supreme Court Youth Parts, during Probation Adjustment and in Delinquency proceedings in Family Court. CFRs Home for Good program provides legal and social work services to CFR clients inimmigration,civil legal servicesandcriminal defensematters, to afford clients an efficient and well-coordinated one-stop solution to a range of issues that threaten family stability.


Recognized as experts in our fields,we annually train over 500 practitioners in the city, state and around the countryon strategies to promote family preservation and interdisciplinary representation, and we provide community based Know Your Rights presentations to parents, youth and service providers.We advocate at the city, state and national level for policies that reduce the harm of family separation, and promote parent engagement and justice for youth and families.

* Provide direct social work support and advocacy to clients, refer clients to supportive services that are culturally and linguistically appropriate, facilitate clients attendance at ICE check-ins and other appointments and work closely with services providers (i.e. therapist, case managers, case planners, etc.) to create networks of support and gather evidence in support of clients cases;
* Conduct biopsychosocial evaluations and draft letters of support for clients to achieve positive outcomes with the immigration courts, USCIS, the Administration for Childrens Services and other agencies;
* Participate in team meetings as well as administrative meetings within CFR and

Douglaston Development, Levine Builders, and Clinton Management are a dynamic privately held group of companies with a unique owner-builder-manager advantage, known collectively as The Douglaston Companies.

In 2002, Clinton Management was founded to manage the expanding portfolio of developments created by Douglaston Development and constructed by Levine Builders. Clinton Management oversees a broad portfolio of moderate-income housing, luxury apartments, commercial, and retail properties.
