South Bronx Community fosters deeper learning and promotes social justice in a culturally responsive and competency-based learning environment. This school is the newest addition to the EPIC network of schools, and is EPIC’s first charter high school.  
**What We Are About:**  
Some notable elements of our school model include the following principles and practices:  
**We are competency-based:** SBC organizes teaching and learning around a critical set of skills that students need for academic, career and life success. Teaching involves making learning targets explicit, providing students with the time and support required to reach their goals, and a process of continuous feedback. We use a mastery-based approach to grading so that students have a clear understanding of what they know and are able to do. On progress reports, students see the skills they are working on and their proficiency levels, rather than course titles and letter grades.  
**We are culturally responsive:** At SBC, strong relationships between staff and students are at the core of our learning model. We implement an advisory and rites of passage program that helps to strengthen relationships and throughout all aspects of the school including our pedagogical approaches, routines and practices. Group mentoring takes place for an extended block of time every week.  
**We are human-centered and adaptive:** At SBC, we encourage the development of all members of the school community and provide opportunities for sharing strengths and talents to enhance individual and collective performance. Significant time is built in to all staff schedules for collaborative planning and tuning of curriculum, supported by improvement science methodology and protocols.  
**We are holistic in terms of integrating academic, social and emotional and professional skills:** SBC integrates social and emotional learning into our competency framework. We strive to make all learning experiences interdisciplinary and inclusive of these skills so that students are prepared for college, careers and community. Being able to manage your relationships and demonstrate leadership can be just as important to success in life as many academic and technical skills.  
**Who We Are Looking For:**  
SBC seeks talented teachers with demonstrated desire and capacity to:  
**Innovate with curriculum and pedagogy –** We seek to support students in taking ownership of their learning. All staff participate in designing and facilitating highly engaging, rigorous learning experiences with resources and scaffolds that allow students to lead their own learning.  
**Pioneer through start-up –** Founding a new school is difficult and can be exhausting in many ways. Staff must be motivated by the challenge and opportunity to develop and design protocols, processes, tools and ultimately establish a culture for learning among young people and staff.  
**Work in community every day –** All learning experiences are interdisciplinary and so staff must be motivated to co-facilitate and co-plan with their colleagues.  
**Practice social justice –** Design, facilitate and participate in experiences and conversations that relate to race, gender, class and sexual identity in ways that empower students and foster community.  
**Be open to new roles –** All staff co-lead group mentoring sessions every week with a small group of students that they support through all four years of high school.  
**Fail forward –** We try new approaches to achieve breakthrough results. All staff contribute to, and learn from, these experiences.  
**Lead through uncertainty –** In order to achieve dramatically better outcomes for young people, sometimes there is no precedent for the strategies we employ. We need staff that can demonstrate leadership in uncharted waters.  
**Resident ENL Specialist Responsibilities**

* Create and implement specialized services and supports for English language learners.
* Facilitate Advisory and Rites of Passage program in partnership with a Learning Coach (staff member with youth development experience).
* Develop and implement targeted small group skill development for students.
