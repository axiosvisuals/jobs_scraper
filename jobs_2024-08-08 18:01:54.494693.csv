The Lotus Method (TLM) was created so women could feel supported, safe and empowered during this transformative time in their lives. TLM was founded by Master Pre/Postnatal trainer, Caitlin Ritt, in 2014 when she observed that the pre/postnatal demographic was massively underserved by big box gyms and group fitness models. In response to this void, she created a fitness methodology and physical space dedicated exclusively to helping women prepare for the demands of pregnancy and motherhood.

Fast forward to 2024, TLM now has four fitness studios in the San Francisco Bay Area, a virtual team and offering, along with a studio in NYC in the heart of Tribeca. We are an amazing group of passionate and talented exercise specialists focused exclusively on serving the fitness needs of pre-and-postnatal clients. TLM is at the forefront of a movement to change the way women exercise and move during pregnancy and the postpartum period. TLM is not merely a brick and mortar for women to exercise--it’s an experience, a community, a safe place to ask questions, discuss sensitive topics, and receive support and guidance. TLM is working towards global brand awareness and you could be an integral part of our growth and development!

**Who You Are**

We are looking for somebody with a demonstrably high EQ (emotional quotient) who is adaptable and excited to grow with TLM and expand the brand. We are looking for those who have either a B.S. in Kinesiology/Exercise Science or experience teaching movement patterns with 2 years of specific experience personal/group training. Most importantly, the ideal trainer is deeply passionate about our mission of empowering women to feel strong, confident and beautiful throughout their journey into motherhood. It is essential that you are excited about and dedicated to working with pre/postnatal clients exclusively.

It is imperative that TLM trainers embody and actualize TLM’s mission through their relationships with clients and approach in their program design. We expect TLM trainers to uphold our mission and represent our core values in every aspect of interaction with clients and colleagues.

**What We Offer**

The opportunity to focus on training clients as opposed to sales, as we have a robust pipeline of clients. W-2 employee with benefits, paid vacation, and sick leave.

Williamsburg Charter High School (WCHS) is a high performing, public charter high school located in Brooklyn, New York. WCHS opened in August 2004 as the first Chancellor-authorized charter high school in the City of New York with a ninth grade class of 131 students. WCHS has grown to serve approximately 963 students in grades nine through twelve. The school’s mission is to unite youth, families, staff, teachers and the community at large in providing young people with the tools necessary to make sense of the world, and prepare them in their journey to become skilled workers and literate citizens of the world. Young people will accomplish this through their participation in a rigorous and demanding liberal arts education that includes language, literature, writing, science, history, mathematics, the arts, technology, and exploration in disciplines designed to teach fairness, justice, respect and compassion for themselves and others, as well as the skills of critical thinking, communication and research.

Williamsburg Charter High School provides a broad liberal arts academic program to the high-school age youth of north Brooklyn. School programs are individualized to connect to each student’s particular level of development, including English Language Learners and students with Special Education Services. Further, WCHS provides supportive relationships with faculty, extended instructional periods, and opportunities after-school and on Saturdays for additional academic support.

The New York City Department of Housing Preservation & Development (HPD) promotes quality and affordability in the city's housing, and diversity and strength in the city’s neighborhoods because every New Yorker deserves a safe, affordable place to live in a neighborhood they love.

* • We maintain building and resident safety and health
* • We create opportunities for New Yorkers through housing affordability
* • We engage New Yorkers to build and sustain neighborhood strength and diversity.

HPD is entrusted with fulfilling these objectives through the goals and strategies of “Housing Our Neighbors: A Blueprint for Housing and Homelessness,” Mayor Adams’ comprehensive housing framework. To support this important work, the administration has committed $5 billion in new capital funding, bringing the 10-year planned investment in housing to $22 billion—the largest in the city’s history. This investment, coupled with a commitment to reduce administrative and regulatory barriers, is a multi-pronged strategy to tackle New York City’s complex housing crisis, by addressing homelessness and housing instability, promoting economic stability and mobility, increasing homeownership opportunities, improving health and safety, and increasing opportunities for equitable growth.

**Your Team:** The Office of Development (OOD) leads the agency’s effort to create and preserve affordable housing as a critical part of Housing Our Neighbors: A Blueprint for Housing and Homelessness in collaboration with other HPD offices as well as other city, state and federal agencies. The OOD is comprised of seven divisions that administer a range of programs. These divisions include New Construction Finance, Special Needs Housing, Building and Land Development Services (BLDS), Homeownership Opportunities and Preservation, Preservation Finance, Compliance and Enforcement and Housing Incentives.
