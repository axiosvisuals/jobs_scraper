Chronic disease is today's leading cause of death and disability in the US and the leading driver of the nation's $4.1 trillion in annual healthcare costs. Patients who live with chronic conditions require far more touch points than our primary care physicians have time to deliver and the result is countless health emergencies and costly ER visits that could be prevented. Workforce shortages and lack of technologies make it difficult to give patients the attention they need.



At Cadence, our mission is to deliver life-changing care to over one million patients living with chronic disease by the end of the decade. We mitigate the impact of chronic disease by using technology and a world-class clinical team to remotely monitor, manage, and support patients at home. Together with our growing network of health system partners, we deliver guideline-directed care to tens of thousands of patients today while producing best-in-class clinical outcomes.


We are seeking an experienced **Senior Product Marketing Manager** to help us achieve our mission. In this role, you will be responsible for leading the marketing strategy for our cutting-edge remote patient monitoring (RPM) platform.

* Work with the field sales team to create effective sales enablement materials, including presentations and case studies
* Measure and analyze the effectiveness of marketing campaigns to optimize performance and ROI.
* Spend time in the field collaborating directly with health system partners and physicians


**What You'll Need**


* 5+ years of experience in a product marketing role
* Bachelor's degree in Marketing, Business, or a related field.
* Proven experience in product marketing in healthcare technology
* Strong understanding of the healthcare market
* Excellent communication and storytelling skills, with the ability to translate complex concepts into clear, compelling messages.
* Ability to work cross-functionally and influence without authority.
* Strong analytical skills and experience with data-driven decision making.
* Ability to thrive in a fast-paced, dynamic environment.


**WHO WE ARE:**



At Cadence, we care. We care for patients in their homes seamlessly using technology. We deliver personalized, accessible care that makes a meaningful impact on patients' health. We believe that all chronic disease patients - regardless of zip code - deserve access to the best possible care. Care is at the core of everything we do.



The most important people at Cadence are the people who take care of our patients, our caregivers: nurse practitioners, registered nurses, medical assistants, patient success coordinators, and more. The patient-centric team at Cadence is reliable, responsive, warm, and knowledgeable. We hold ourselves to a high bar to deliver a memorable patient experience; a level of care that we all want for our own family members.



At Cadence, unlike most traditional healthcare settings, things change rapidly and that necessitates employees who embrace technology and are committed to helping build an even better service for patients and partner providers than we have today.



If you are passionate about putting patients first and changing the way care is delivered in America, join us at Cadence! Together, we'll make a meaningful impact on the lives of those we serve.

In no situation shall a Service Provider provide services where he/she does not meet the minimum educational requirements and qualifications necessary to provide such services as documented.**

**Psychiatric Supports and Treatment Services (CPST)**

CPST services must be part of the treatment plan, which includes goals and activities necessary to correct or ameliorate conditions discovered during the initial assessment visits. CPST is a face-to-face intervention with the child/youth (required), family/caregiver or other collateral supports. This is a multi-component service that consists of therapeutic interventions such as counseling, as well as functional supports.
* Activities provided under CPST are intended to assist the child/youth and family caregivers to achieve stability and functional improvement in daily living, personal recovery and/or resilience, family and interpersonal relationships in school and community integration.

Activities are “hands on” and task oriented, intended to achieve the identified goals or objectives as set forth in the child/youth’s individualized treatment plan.

PSR is intended to foster and promote the development of needed skills identified in assessment or through the ongoing treatment of a licensed practitioner. PSR services are to be recommended by a licensed practitioner and a part of a treatment plan. PSR activities are focused on addressing the rehabilitative needs of the child/youth as part of a treatment plan and can be provided in coordination with treatment interventions by a licensed practitioner (e.g. OLP) or provider of CPST.
