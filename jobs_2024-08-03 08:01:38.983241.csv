Have you ever wondered what happens to cats and dogs whose owners are unable to afford veterinary care? We did. The ASPCA’s Community Medicine (CM) team provides expert veterinary care to support the welfare of animals and their people through our stationary and mobile veterinary clinics, serving the most underserved communities in New York, Miami, and Los Angeles. We help pet owners overcome barriers to care, bringing quality services directly to the communities that need us most and partially or fully subsidizing the cost of basic and preventive care. CM treats people and pets with dignity and respect, assisting pet owners in making informed decisions about their pets’ health and wellbeing regardless of their financial circumstances.

Posting Date: 5/10/2023
Location: Staten Island, NY
Category/Area of Expertise: Retail Operations


**Address:** USA-NY-Staten Island-1441 Richmond Avenue
  

**Store Code:** SS - Store Admin (2502768)  

  

  

  

At Stop & Shop, we are dedicated to creating and maintaining a culture where the diverse backgrounds and experiences of our associates are celebrated, and all associates feel they belong and thrive. We work as one team to break down barriers, put the customer first and show that we care for our customers, communities and each other. At Stop & Shop, we're here to feed all of life's moments, and we've made a promise to our customers to help them make the small wins possible every day.
  

  

**PRIMARY PURPOSE**  

  

What ingredients make up the perfect bake shop clerk? Well, our clerks are measured by their ability to serve customers. They delight customers with sweets and treats prepared and decorated especially for them. They also help our customers by answering questions and finding what they’re looking for. Of course, you can’t have fresh and delicious treats without a freshly cleaned kitchen, and they take care of that too. This is just a general overview of their job duties. You may be asked to assist in other ways too, depending on the needs of your store.  

  

**Hourly Rate: $15.00**
