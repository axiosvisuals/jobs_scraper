So you have to be on time and have your own reliable transportation. Dinner time is 630, and bedtime is 930.

My son is not big on electronics, he has a very active imagination. This is where people tend to struggle the most you have to have a very unorthodox approach when trying to get him to engage. You'll need your imagination to the point you can talk to objects like their people and you'll have to be able to start up games without looking to him for participation. You'll have to have a high energy personalities that will draw him into what your game is, only then will he participate. If you try to directly engage him into the start of your game he won't be interested. The best methods to use are a reverse psychology approach combined with role play. Examples are saying loudly how no one is allowed in specific areas except for you and putting a guard to keep people out will draw him in. Another you voice that you hear something in the other room and when you check it out act out something you see and yell for help. If this is a skill set you can do definitely reach out.

We are looking for a self-motivated, organized individual who is passionate about patient care and excited for the opportunity to independently manage their cases with confidence and accountability. As a Peritoneal Dialysis Registered Nurse (PD RN), you will be providing education on peritoneal dialysis to your patients and their care partners in a clinical setting, which then allows them to dialyze from home.


You have responsibility over the complete ongoing care of each patient to ensure their treatment stays on track.


Dialysis Experience is NOT required. Nephrology nursing provides a fresh lens and set of skills to those newly entering the field.

**What you can expect:**

	+ Training patients takes time and mental energy and the rewards of that investment come in seeing the transformation of your patients from feeling sick and afraid, to strong, independent, and able to do the daily things that they love. Educating patients on their options when it comes to dialysis not only helps them own their journey, but also expands the program to people who will benefit greatly from PD.
	+ *Home RN partners to provide ongoing dialysis treatment education activities supporting the healthy growth of the home program. This includes educating new in-center hemodialysis patients in the clinics.*

**Schedule**

* Typically, an 8-hour day, Monday through Friday with weekends and holidays off!

* Scheduled home visits and on-call shifts vary by program and are compensated accordingly.

**What we’ll provide:**

* Clear and competitive career growth for a lifetime nursing career.
* If you are new to dialysis, we’ll provide a 9-12 week paid-training and the support to guide you through to becoming a nephrology nurse.
* Annual $3,000 tuition reimbursement and potential $25,000 scholarship opportunity. CNN, CDN, and CPDN certification reimbursement. 100+ CEU courses at no-cost.
* Comprehensive benefits package: including medical, dental, vision, 401k match, family resources, pet insurance, mental health resources, back-up child and elder care and so much more.
