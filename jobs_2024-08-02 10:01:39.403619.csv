Responsibilities:
**Functional Description:**
PepsiCo Procurement in North America is divided into two primary business units – Beverages (Purchase, NY) and Foods (Plano, TX). The Procurement function is responsible for developing and executing sourcing strategies that deliver best-in-class economics, supply assurance, and sustainability practices for both people and the planet.  

Procurement is a highly collaborative organization that partners across many functions within the company, including R&D (scientists and engineers to develop industry-leading ingredients and packaging), Marketing (ensure supplier capabilities grow in line with future-looking consumer insights), Finance and Legal (robust analysis and reporting metrics and competitor intel, and best-in-class agreements with external industries), and Manufacturing Plants (facilities that efficiently produce the snacks and beverages that make consumers smile across the globe) to name a few.  

Procurement develops deep industry knowledge and delivers competitive advantage to PEP by negotiating best-in-class sourcing strategies across the following areas:* Packaging (cans, bottles, chip bags, etc.)
* Ingredients (Vegetable Oils, Sugar, Corn, etc.)
* Supply Assurance (planning & analysis, logistics, manufacturing, etc.)
* Commodity Risk Management (hedging programs, risk mitigation, competitive analysis, etc.)
* Indirects (IT, Marketing Equipment, Services, etc.)

**What you can expect:**
The internship program will be approximately 10 weeks over the summer months. An internship in Procurement at PepsiCo is an opportunity to independently solve a critical business problem. Each intern is presented with a timely question for their team and challenged to think strategically to provide a provocative and comprehensive recommendation during their final presentation. This structure mirrors the project-based work process of full-time employees. Although this process lends itself to great autonomy in setting agenda, workflow and output, interns have the full support and backing of their managers and the broader Procurement function. As a class, PepsiCo interns are availed of best-in-class exposure to senior leadership, education on the myriad pieces of the global PepsiCo organization, and opportunities to build relationships with fellow interns across PepsiCo through a calendar packed summer of fun events! **Each intern in Procurement will be assigned to one of the above categories and will:*** Develop comprehensive procurement strategies and programs that improve quality, productivity, sustainability and innovation
* Develop expertise in procurement fundamentals and categories
* Develop functional knowledge including Cost Management, Responsible & Ethical Sourcing, etc.
* Gain exposure to category contracts and supplier management
* Gather and analyze data to provide meaningful insights
* Work with cross-functional global teams on unique and focused project work
* GP internships will be located in Plano, TX, Purchase, NY

**Previous Procurement intern projects have included:*** Should PepsiCo vertically integrate the production of Popcorners or rely on external manufacturing? Should we buy equipment, lease, pursue another path? What are the advantages/disadvantages to localize overseas operations?
* Identify and develop an industry appropriate sustainability scheme to supplement our apple juice sourcing strategy. Assess all options, align key stakeholders and make business recommendations.
* Develop a template to track supplier greenhouse gas reductions, benchmark across 20 rigid packaging suppliers, and develop recommendations to optimize results.
* Conduct an analysis of different sourcing strategies including RFPs, e-auctions, blind auctions, reverse auctions, etc. and the optimal conditions for each type, including how they apply to different Packaging and Ingredient categories at PEP.
* Analyze the current landscape of PepsiCo suppliers and develop a strategy to increase Black and Hispanic representation in our partnerships and supply chain

**Compensation & Benefits:*** The expected compensation hourly pay ranges for hires into our 2025 campus intern openings is $20.50 - $39.60/hour
* Role, degree discipline, degree level, and location are part of the process when determining actual starting salary for positions
* Hourly pay for our campus hires is pre-determined and non-negotiable
* We love to convert our interns to full time opportunities! Our full time positions have a comprehensive benefits package that include:

In addition to salary, PepsiCo offers a comprehensive benefits package to support our employees and their families, subject to elections and eligibility: Medical, Dental, Vision, Disability, Health and Dependent Care Reimbursement Accounts, Employee Assistance Program (EAP), Insurance (Accident, Group Legal, Life), Defined Contribution Retirement Plan


Qualifications:
**What we’re looking for:*** Currently pursuing a degree in: Finance, Economics, Operations, Engineering, Supply Chain Management, Agribusiness, or Agronomy (other related majors may be considered)
