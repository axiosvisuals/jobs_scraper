We began YBYD with the intention to help entrepreneurs like us better understand the world of sales and retail.

We realized that some of the main struggles brands were facing were:

* not having enough understanding of the economics needed to survive in retail
* having a small or no team at all to represent and support the brand on the field
* going after the wrong distribution and retail partners, slowing down their performance and return on investment

**About Us:**



Competitive triathletes and passionate bakers, Pam Weekes and Connie McDonald left their careers to open a small bread shop in New York City in 1995 — Levain Bakery.  

One day, they baked a BIG chocolate chip walnut cookie as energy for triathlon training. At Levain, a batch of these 6-ounce cookies flew off the shelves, and an icon was born. The cozy shop on West 74th Street became a neighborhood favorite and a destination for epicurious visitors from around the world, hungry for “the cookie.”  


From the start, Pam, Connie and team baked everything fresh on-site each day, donating the day’s leftovers to charity — and we still do, nearly 30 years later. Today, Levain has bakeries across the country (with more to come!), plus ecommerce gift boxes to treat cookie lovers in every state.  


Every day, we strive to embody our company’s five core values:
* Welcome All- *we are all in it together*
* Work Hard and Be Nice- *we go above and beyond*
* Lead with Heart- *we do the right thing*
* Rise Up- *we are proactive*
* Savor It- *we are present and find the fun!*","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Levain-Bakery","http://www.levainbakery.com","New York","2 to 10","less than $1M (USD)","","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/1497c6aa21dc80b7a30bd7185f92e8ca","","",""

StaffCo is a Professional Employer Organization, commonly referred to as a PEO, duly organized and registered under the New York Professional Employer Organization law. StaffCo and SUNY have entered into a professional employer agreement under which StaffCo is the employer of Stony Brook Clinical Practice Management Plan employees and responsible for all aspects of employment, including hirings, promotions, disciplines, terminations, the day-to-day direction and supervision of work, as well as labor relations and collective bargaining. StaffCo is fully responsible for providing all payroll and human resources services, including the payment of wages, collecting and reporting payroll taxes and maintaining any and all employee benefits. SUNY Stony Brook Hospital is responsible for the operation of the hospital and provision of health care and is the co-employer as is necessary to conduct its responsibilities and for related licensure, regulatory or statutory requirements and obligations.

  

Given StaffCo’s employment responsibilities, it is deemed the “employer” for employment and labor law purposes. Thus, the employees are private sector employees of StaffCo, not public sector employees of SUNY. The private sector nature of the StaffCo employees has been approved by NYS Civil Service and upheld in a decision by the US National Labor Relations Board.

Our mission at Roam is to make homeownership 2x more affordable for 1 million Americans by 2030. We help buyers wind back the clock on interest rates by purchasing a home with a low-rate assumable mortgage, a type of loan where the buyer can take over the mortgage terms from the seller. All government-backed loans such as FHA and VA loans are eligible for assumption by law, and there are millions of these loans at rates below 4%. With a low-rate assumable mortgage, buyers can save up to 50% on monthly payments compared to buying with a traditional mortgage at today’s rates.


Roam helps buyers find these homes for sale with the first-ever listing platform for homes with assumable mortgages.
