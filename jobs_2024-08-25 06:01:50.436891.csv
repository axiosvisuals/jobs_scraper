The Fortune Society, Inc.

The organization has evolved into one of the nations preeminent reentry and justice-informed service organizations, providing formerly incarcerated people with the skills and wrap-around services needed to break the cycle of crime and incarceration and to build productive lives in their communities.


Fortune has grown steadily over the years to an annual budget of now $80 million with approximately 600 staff. We anticipate that we will keep growing, both in size and in depth of service. Fortune has a dual mission: both advocacy and service. The advocacy portion of our mission focuses on building a more just criminal legal system and reducing the barriers to reentry into society. The service side of Fortune has evolved to encompass a broad range of programs that started with employment and education and now includes a robust array of services, among them: alternatives to incarceration, supervised release, court advocacy, discharge planning within correctional facilities, licensed substance use and mental health treatment, a housing continuum ranging from emergency and transitional through permanent congregate and scattered site housing, assistance in obtaining benefits, a care management unit, HIV services, a food and nutrition program, and an arts program. Each service we provide is informed by the needs of the population we serve. Fortune currently serves approximately 13,000 people a year. Our client population mirrors the incarcerated population in being approximately 85% male and over 90% people of color. Our program models are recognized, both nationally and internationally for their quality and innovation.

These values are real and guide all of our decisions in how we operate and how we treat people. This includes our decisions to hire, reward, and fire. Every single person at Elsewhere will be held to these standards. This is how we build a great team, achieve our goals, and do so enjoyably.

 **INCLUSIVITY**
Elsewhere is a haven for our staff, artists, and audiences to experience the joy of expressing their authentic selves. Everybody has the right to feel welcomed and understood here, in direct defiance of all the ways our society tries to divide us up out there. We crave connectivity and togetherness. We’re curious about the unknown. We’re open-minded to a fault.

 **OPTIMISM**
The chills we get experiencing transcendent music in a crowd remind us that a better world is possible. Elsewhere is a celebration of that feeling - of joy, wonder, and hope.We are here to have fun, and we reject cynicism in all its forms.

 **RESPECT**
Our love for the game comes from a place of deep respect: for the extraordinary history of music and nightlife in NYC, for the working artists out there redefining culture, and for our staff who live and breathe it every night. To do right, we extend that respect to each other and everyone else along the journey.

 **SELFLESSNESS**
Our job means service: to our teammates, artists, customers, community, city, and to the culture. We celebrate individuality, but there is no place for ego.

 **PASSION**
There are much easier ways to earn a living. The renewable resource that keeps our team sustained is an unshakable conviction in some aspect of our mission, whether it’s supporting new artists, helping audiences discover music, building community, or shifting culture.

 **EXCELLENCE**
To accomplish our goals we aim high, and work both hard and smart.

 **CREATIVITY**
The beauty of culture is that it is always evolving, and so should we. We value out-of-


the-box thinking, challenging “the way things are,” and imaginative leaps. Like in art, it is better for us to fail trying something new than to not be experimenting in the first place.
