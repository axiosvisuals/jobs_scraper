Figaro first opened its doors in 1957 and quickly became a place to be.

**About KPot**

K-Pot offers both worlds of Korean BBQ and Asian Hot Pot.

What is Hot Pot? Hot pot is an Asian cooking method, prepared with a simmering pot of soup stock at the dining table, containing a variety of East Asian foods and ingredients. While your hot pot is simmering, ingredients are placed into the pot and are cooked at the table in front of your eyes, in a manner similar to fondue.

Korean barbecue known locally as (고기구이) gogi-gui, “Meat Roast”, refers to the Korean cuisine method of grilling meat such as beef, chicken or pork, that you prepare yourself at your table. Our menu offers an extensive selection of fresh quality meats, seafood, noodles, and vegetables for Hot Pot and BBQ experience
