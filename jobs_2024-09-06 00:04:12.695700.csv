The Mount Sinai Hospital is a 1,134-bed facility with an extensive outpatient and specialty care network and is the largest hospital in the Mount Sinai Health Care System. It offers comprehensive social work services and programming to meet the myriad needs of the diverse populations we serve. We believe that total patient care must emphasize the physical, emotional, and social needs of each patient and their care partners.

Founded in 1907, the Department of Social Work Services at the Mount Sinai Hospital is one of the oldest hospital social work departments in the nation with over 450 licensed social workers employed across more than 65 different program/service areas.

**About Us:**



Warby Parker was founded with a mission: to inspire and impact the world with vision, purpose, and style.



We're constantly asking ourselves how we can do more and make a greater impact, and that starts by reimagining everything that a company and industry can be. We want to demonstrate that a business can scale while doing good in the world, without charging a premium for it. And we've learned that it takes creativity, empathy, and innovation to achieve that goal.



Since the day we launched in 2010, we've pioneered ideas, designed products, and developed technologies that help people see. We offer everything you need for happier eyes at a price that leaves you with money in your pocket, from designer-quality glasses and contacts to eye exams and vision tests, and you can meet us online, at our stores, or even in your home. Wherever and whenever you need it, we're there to make exceptional vision care simple and accessible. (Delightful, too.)



Ultimately, we believe in vision for all, which is why for every pair of glasses or sunglasses we sell, a pair of glasses is distributed to someone in need through our Buy a Pair, Give a Pair program.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Warby-Parker","http://www.warbyparker.com","New York","501 to 1,000","","Marby Parker was founded with a rebellious spirit and a lofty objective: to offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price, while leading the way for socially conscious businesses.","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/56f2123c26a1b1e8687851d8f0ef08d2","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_headerimage/1960x400/49ea419eaf79e3492df75cdfc33ccee7","Neil Blumenthal",""
