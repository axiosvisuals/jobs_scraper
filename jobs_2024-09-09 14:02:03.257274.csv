Leaders In Our Neighborhood (LION) Charter School’s mission is to develop the character of each student. We unite students, families, and staff in helping each individual achieve their best academically, and in sports, the arts, and service to the community. We believe that passion for learning, self-discovery, leadership, and social conscience are the foundation for success in college and fulfillment in life.

  



We believe that all children, regardless of their neighborhood, race, or income, are gifted with distinct talents to offer the world and that school is a place for students to develop the skills and mindsets needed to become their best selves.
