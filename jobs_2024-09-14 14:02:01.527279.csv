**Position Type** Non-Management  

**POSITION SUMMARY**

  


As the original house of luxury, St. Regis continues to redefine modern luxury through service. At the core is the Butler program, an icon to our heritage and the heart and soul of new luxury. It is high-touch, personalized, creative and original. It is brought to life by all talent but serving as the primary face to the program is our Butler team, who are the ultimate luxury ambassadors.

  



The Butler provides bespoke experiences and services to fulfill all guest needs during pre-arrival, check-in, throughout the stay and upon departure, in partnership with other departments in the hotel operation. This includes coordinating efforts of Butler Valets, and verifying that other departments supporting butler services are equipped to meet guest needs. The Butler is key to building rapport with guests, proactively anticipate guest needs and acting upon them where possible.

  



While the St. Regis brand is steeped in history with roots that can be traced back to the early 1900s, every team member is part of a trailblazing future to redefine modern luxury through service. The Butler’s success is rooted in a deep passion for service, uncompromising standards, the ability to anticipate needs and impeccable interpersonal skills.

  



You will also be expected to create a safe workplace, follow company policies and procedures, uphold quality standards, and ensure your uniform, personal appearance, and communications are professional. Butler team members will be on their feet and moving around (stand, sit, or walk for an extended time) and taking a hands-on approach to work (move, lift, carry, push, pull, and place objects weighing less than or equal to 50 pounds without assistance). Doing all these things well (and other reasonable job duties as requested) is critical for Butler team members – to get it right for our guests and our business each and every time.
