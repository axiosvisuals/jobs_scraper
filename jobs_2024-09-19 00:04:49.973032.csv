**CAMPUS SPECIFIC INFORMATION**


The Graduate Center, CUNY is the focal point for advanced teaching and research at The City University of New York (CUNY), the nation's largest urban public university. With over 35 doctoral and master's programs of the highest caliber, the Graduate Center fosters pioneering research and scholarship in the arts and sciences and prepares students for careers in universities and the private, nonprofit, and government sectors. The Graduate Center's commitment to research and scholarship for the public good is exemplified by its more than 30 centers, institutes, and initiatives, including its Advanced Science Research Center (ASRC), a 200,000 square-foot facility in upper Manhattan, designed to promote collaboration among scientists in five areas of global research and innovation: nanoscience, photonics, structural biology, neuroscience, and environmental sciences.


The Graduate Center (GC) benefits from highly ambitious and diverse students and alumni-who in turn teach hundreds of thousands of undergraduates every year. Through its public programs, the Graduate Center enhances New York City's intellectual and cultural life.


The ASRC's Structural Biology Initiative seeks a Research Associate (Post-doctoral Fellow) who will report to Professor Vallese Francesca. The Vallese research aims to elucidate the structural and functional aspects of Ankyrin complexes, which play a crucial role in cellular architecture and function. The primary focus will be on isolating these complexes from their native systems, including blood, neurons, and cardiomyocytes, followed by detailed structural determination using Cryo-EM.


The ultimate goal of this research is to understand the interactions between the proteins within these complexes and their functional roles in their native cellular environments. Abnormalities in the components of these complexes are linked to various human disorders, and our research utilizing Cryo-Electron Tomography (Cryo-ET) will contribute to the identification and understanding of these abnormalities.


In addition to structural studies, we are integrating complementary biochemical and cell biological approaches to provide a comprehensive understanding of these complexes. These methods include Biolayer Interferometry (BLI), single-molecule tracking, and in vitro reconstitution techniques. These combined approaches will help delineate the mechanisms that govern the architecture and function of the Ankyrin complexes, offering insights into their roles in health and disease.


It is expected that the incumbent will independently pursue new research ideas, publish outstanding papers and publicize his/her work at conferences, mentor graduate students, and participate in fundraising efforts.


The lab is part of a dynamic and multidisciplinary research environment at the Structural Biology Initiative of ASRC, in which multiple groups share mixed labs, structures and facilities.

Unlike most used clothing businesses we have an environmental mission: to keep clothes out of the trash. In just the last year we collected over 30 million pounds of clothes. The impact of the clothes we collected is the following:

* 320 million pounds of CO2emissions
* 20 billion gallons of water
* The electricity usage of 10,000 American homes

  

In addition to our textile operations, we have a rapidly growing wholesale business. We are proud to be a Public Benefit Corporation and a Certified B Corp with an environmental mission. We believe that the tragedy of clothing filling our landfills and incinerators needs to stop.


To fight this battle, we work with partners large and small to place clothing collection containers, schedule collection drives, engage with cities and towns, manage unwanted inventories, and spread the word that CLOTHES ARENT TRASH.
