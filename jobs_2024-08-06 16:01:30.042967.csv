### **Description**

The NYU Department of Environmental Studies (ES) is seeking a Researcher to help advance departmental research activities across a rapidly expanding department and new graduate program. The Dept of Environmental Studies is expecting to greatly increase the size of its research personnel, faculty, lab space, etc., while at the same time growing a brand new PhD program. Inherent to ES scholarship is collaboration and cross-lab interaction, particularly of growing research staff and early-career scholars, in the form of joint lab meetings, workshops and conferences, internal departmental seminars and symposia, co-teaching materials development, and so on.  



We are therefore seeking a new, unique position in the form of a Researcher to help advance these collaborative activities and provide support across the department to help researchers and scholars access and take full advantage of collaborative opportunities, while also “telling the department’s story” via dedicated communications to alumni, possible donors, and the public at-large.  



The specific job duties include (but are not limited to):
* Supporting targeted research requests (e.g. data analyses and visualization, literature searches, etc) for multiple faculty members
* Supporting and organizing cross-lab research projects within the ES dept and across NYU departments engaged in similar work
* Coordinating research, networking and collaboration events for early-career scholarship and non-faculty lab research personnel across ES
* Organizing and attending to logistics for research-specific workshops and conferences that involve multiple ES departmental faculty members
* Crafting communications on departmental research advances, including (but not limited to) website updates, email communications to alumni and donor networks, social media and related platforms
* Coordinating internal NYU ES faculty-focused colloquia (outreach, setup, breakdown, honoraria documentation, etc.)
* Developing a user-friendly, policy relevant data portal consisting of nitrogen production, consumption and loss data, as well as data on national policies and other indicators as needed. Maintain regular interactions with project leads and stakeholders to ensure portal integrity, usability and relevance.

  


The relevant skills and experience for this position include:  


* Highest levels of organization; attention to detail and autonomy; the successful candidate would be able to operate to a high level of performance with minimal oversight
* Highest levels of communication; the successful candidate must be prompt in their responses and acknowledgements of communications, patient with people and processes, and have the ability to dig deep to find answers in unique situations and circumstances
* A quick learner
* Ability to develop and maintain strong working relationships both within the ES dept and across NYU
* Ability to be nimble and pivot as circumstances change
* A strong foundational understanding of major topical areas in the ES field and a strong desire to learn more from ES dept research
* Ability to conduct thorough and sometimes annotated literature searches and reviews with little oversight
* The ability to create visualizations worthy of high-impact publications, work with geospatial data, and conduct basic environmental data analyses is highly desirable
* The ability to develop and maintain strong working relationships with project leads and other stakeholders - NGO representatives to policymakers.

  


The initial appointment is for one year, with a renewal for a second year pending the availability of funds and successful review. The successful candidate will be based in the growing Dept. of Environmental Studies at NYU’s Washington Square campus in New York City. The appointment will provide ample opportunity to engage with the highly interdisciplinary department faculty and our growing focus area on land systems, including natural and social science dimensions.  


*In compliance with NYC’s Pay Transparency Act, the annual base salary for this position is* *$43,888 (commensurate with experience and* *increased to $58,656 effective January 1, 2025)**. New York University considers factors such as (but not limited to) the specific grant funding and the terms of the research grant when extending an offer.*  



The anticipated start date for the position is October 1st, 2024 (with some flexibility in this timeframe).  



All inquiries may be addressed, with contact information for three references, to Dr. Sonali Shukla McDermid (sps246@nyu.edu).

### **Description**

The McDevitt laboratory at New York University has a long tradition of developing new medical microdevice technologies that are suitable for early disease detection. In this R61 project funded by the NIH, powerful new diagnostic tools that allow individuals to self‐test for acute phase HIV infections will be developed, optimized, and tested. The diagnostic tools here developed will allow patients previously diagnosed as HIV positive to monitor their viral load following ART interruption or check for loss of viral control due to the emergence of drug resistance. Given these diagnostics are to be used in a patient’s own home (or other non‐clinical, setting), they need to be cheap, robust, and suitable for use without prior training or specialist equipment. Further, they should use a biological sample that can be obtained in a minimally invasive manner (e.g. a finger‐stick blood drop) to encourage frequent retesting in target populations.



To address the above problems, the study team will integrate two existing technologies to generate a sensitive home‐test diagnostic for HIV. The first technology (Helen Dooley lab) is a structurally novel binding domain, so called VNARs, that we isolate from immunized sharks. Despite their diminutive size (12kDa), the VNAR domains raised thus far have binding affinities equal to classical antibodies, but are intrinsically much more chemo‐ and thermostable. VNARs interact with antigen in unique ways and can be raised against epitopes that are inaccessible to conventional antibodies; we will exploit this fact to target the HIV proteins p24 and Env, allowing us to capture and accurately quantify free proteins or whole virus in unmanipulated blood. We will integrate these VNARs with our second technology (McDevitt lab), the programmable Bio‐Nano‐Chip (p‐BNC), a micro-chip-based detection system which utilizes porous agarose microbeads as 3D diagnostic surfaces. Immunometric assays can be performed by loading the beads with biomolecules such as antibodies, or in this case VNARs, allowing the capture and quantitation of desired target(s) in biological samples. To enable use of this technology in a non‐clinical setting, we will develop credit card‐sized diagnostic cartridges that have a microbead‐based sensor array at their core, and microfluidic system for the delivery of sample, wash buffer, and detection reagent. This will be deployed and read by a battery powered handheld reader system that will be developed and fabricated during our project. This system will use an imaging system derived from smartphones and enable the safe and secure uploading of data to a cloud‐based repository. Together these technologies will allow us to deliver an inexpensive, robust, sensitive, and accurate diagnostic test that can be used by an individual to assess their HIV status or closely monitor their viral load, without a clinic visit.



Position Summary: The McDevitt laboratory at NYU now offers an exciting opportunity to join the study team as a Postdoctoral Research Associate. The ideal candidate will offer extensive experiences in the areas of microfluidics-based point-of-care devices, in vitro diagnostics, ELISA-based assays, and biosensors. The selected individual will work on an interdisciplinary team and contribute to the development of the above-described low-cost point-of-care diagnostic platform for management of HIV patients.



Job Duties/Responsibilities:


* Develop bead-based point-of-care devices for singleplex and multiplex detection of the HIV proteins p24 and Env for use in newly fashioned in vitro diagnostic devices
* Use principles of ELISA-based assays for biosensor development
* Optimize conditions for singleplex and multiplex detection of biomarkers in the bead-based configuration of the programmable Bio‐Nano‐Chip sensor platform
* Use established imaged based approaches to develop dose curves to quantitate the concentrations of the HIV proteins for p24 and Env quantitation of clinically relevant specimens
* Handles safely a variety of clinical samples using safe laboratory practices and follows established safety protocols
* Assists in implementing new procedures and protocols to support experiments; participates actively in developing, recommending, and implementing new approved procedures, or modifications to existing protocols and procedures; maintains and updates technical knowledge
* Review appropriate literature pertaining to current or proposed research
* Prepare materials for publications, reports, and grant applications
* Present results in group meetings and project seminars
* Help to supervise more junior research lab members


*In compliance with NYC’s Pay Transparency Act, the annual base salary range for this position is $64,000 - $68,000. New York University considers factors such as (but not limited to) the specific grant funding and the terms of the research grant when extending an offer.*

### **Description**

We are inviting applications for a Postdoctoral Associate Position at NYU Courant and CDS, to work on the physics of air-sea interaction, under the supervision of Prof Laure Zanna. The position is part of the recent National Science Foundation Learning the Earth with Artificial intelligence and Physics (LEAP) Science and Technology Center (STC), https://leap.columbia.edu/, a large multi-institutional center with a goal to improve climate projections using novel artificial intelligence for better climate adaptation.


Physical properties, such as momentum, heat, moisture, are exchanged at the air-sea interface and are essential for weather and climate. These exchanges - or surface fluxes - are determined empirically, using rather crude approximations, known as “ bulk formulae,” which relate large-scale quantities to fast and local exchanges of properties and constrained with somewhat spotty spatial observations. All observational estimates and climate model parameterizations rely on bulk formulas for air-sea fluxes. Based on bulk formulae, current observationally-derived estimates of the net heat flux into the ocean range from -10 W/m2 to 40 W/m2. The uncertainty in surface fluxes is an order of magnitude larger than the climate change signal (~ 1W/m2). In this project, we propose to rethink the parametrization of surface fluxes.


The postdoctoral associate will help develop a physics-informed, interpretable parameterization using a range of direct measurements (in situ and satellite-based), model output, and a combination of machine learning tools - in particular causal inference and equation discovery. The postdoctoral research will collaborate with a range of scientists at NYU, Columbia and NCAR.


Further information about equation-discovery for physics is discussed in a recent Quanta article, and details about LEAP’s goals are on our website.


One of the primary goals of LEAP is to increase the diversity in geosciences and data science, to be on par with the US population by the end of the Science and Technology Center (STC) lifetime. The STC will take proactive steps to reach its diversity goal. We thus particularly welcome applicants from underrepresented groups.


The position, available immediately, is a full-time appointment, initially for one year, with the possibility of renewal for up to three years, subject to satisfactory performance and available funding.


In compliance with NYC’s Pay Transparency Act, the annual base salary range for this position is $58,500 - $90,000. New York University considers factors such as (but not limited to) the specific grant funding and the terms of the research grant when extending an offer.



### **Qualifications**

* Completion of a PhD in Atmospheric, Oceanic or Climate sciences, Physics, Applied Mathematics, Physics, Engineering, or a related field at the time of the appointment;
* Strong background in climate science or related field;
* Experience with statistical techniques;
* Candidates should have a record of relevant publications in the peer-reviewed scientific literature appropriate to their career stage, and demonstrated effective written and verbal communication skills

**Desirable**


* Experience in analysis of large datasets
* Experience, or demonstrated interest, in machine learning
### **Application Instructions**

For full consideration, applicants should submit the following by 12/02/2022:


* a Curriculum Vitae with a list of publications,
* a cover letter (no more than 2 pages) detailing their research experience, how their interests would fit the current positions, career plans, and available start date,

**Post Doctoral Associate**  

**Full-time**


We are looking to recruit a highly motivated Postdoctoral Associate for our newly initiated research program centered around compartmentalized G protein signaling by internalized G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in the **Thomsen Laboratory of Biomolecular Pharmacology at New York University's College of Dentistry**. Over the past years, we discovered a new signaling paradigm whereby certain GPCRs can stimulate G protein signaling from endosomes through the formation of a unique receptor complex termed the “megaplex” (Thomsen, Plouffe, Cahill III *et al.* (2016), *Cell*; Cahill III & Thomsen *et al.* (2017), *PNAS*; Nguyen, Thomsen, Cahill III *et al*. (2019), *Nat Struct Mol Biol*). As we now understand this mechanism to the near-atomic level, our current research focus is to study how the megaplex regulates physiological functions. In this regard, we are particularly interested in how compartmentalized chemokine receptors promote chemotactic cell migration, as well as how to target sustained endosomal GPCR signaling using novel innovative drug discovery strategies.


The primary project of the successful candidate funded by the **NCI/NIH** aims to develop a deep understanding of cellular processes taking place during the chemotaxis of immune and cancer cells. We recently concluded a project on the downstream signaling aspects of compartmentalized chemokine receptor signaling (**https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.27.509755v1.full**), and thus, we are now interested in investigating how these events orchestrate larger biological changes that enable cells to migrate towards chemokine stimuli. The project will involve work with immune cell models, as well as primary metastatic tissue isolated from melanoma patients, and seeks to use interdisciplinary approaches to address this question. These approaches include **cell & molecular biology, advanced microscopy (super-resolution and/or electron microscopy), and cell migration assays**.


As we are dedicated to applying the insights learned from this project to the design of innovative therapeutic solutions for cell-based therapy, this position is ideal for individuals who are committed to a research career **in academia** or **in** **bioentrepreneurship**.


In addition, it is also expected that the applicant will participate in related **secondary projects and collaborative projects** within and/or outside our laboratory.


NYU provides a competitive salary and benefits package, reduced housing cost in the heart of Manhattan in New York (subject to funding and availability of housing), and, in line with University and College guidelines, full support for eligible international visa applicants as applicable.


Finally, as the lab is devoted to provide a **diverse and inclusive** environment, individuals from racial and ethnic backgrounds that historically have been underrepresented in sciences in the US are encouraged to apply.


*In compliance with NYC’s Pay Transparency Act, the annual base salary range for this position is $58,500 - $61,450. New York University considers factors such as (but not limited to) the specific grant funding and the terms of the research grant when extending an offer.*



### **Qualifications**

Qualified candidates must:


* Posses a Ph.D. and / or M.D. with a strong background in Cell and Molecular Biology and Biomedical Research.
* Be motivated and creative with a strong ability to problem solve and troubleshoot experiments.
* Be comfortable working independently while maintaining a team-based mindset.
* Have excellent experimental, scientific writing and organization skills.
* Be able to communicate scientific material and work well in a collaborative environment. Good oral and written communication skills are musts.

### **Description**

The Institute for the Study of the Ancient World (ISAW) is a center for advanced scholarly research and graduate education, which aims to encourage particularly the study of the economic, religious, political and cultural connections between ancient civilizations. In an effort to embrace a truly inclusive geographical scope while maintaining continuity and coherence, the Institute focuses on the shared and overlapping periods in the development of cultures and civilizations around the Mediterranean basin, and across central Asia to the Pacific Ocean. The approaches of anthropology, archaeology, geography, geology, history, economics, sociology, art history, digital humanities, and the history of science and technology are as integral to the enterprise as the study of texts, philosophy, and the analysis of artifacts.



ISAW anticipates appointing up to three funded one-year Research Scholars for the 2025-26 academic year (September 1, 2025-August 31, 2026). Holders of these positions are appointed as professional research staff and will undertake research projects connected with ISAW's core academic mission. They are expected to be in residence at the Institute during the period for which they are appointed and to take part in the intellectual life of the community. In addition, Research Scholars are expected to participate in ISAW seminars, give a public lecture on their research at ISAW, and play an active role in mentoring graduate students.



Applicants should be individuals of scholarly distinction or promise in any relevant field of ancient studies who will benefit from the stimulation of working in an environment with colleagues in other disciplines. Scholars with a history of interdisciplinary exchange and scholars whose academic interests include parts of the ancient Old World that are often underrepresented in traditional academic departments, including Africa, Central Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia, are especially welcome and encouraged to apply.



Research Scholars at ISAW have access to the Institute's own library, as well as to a wide range of other libraries at NYU, The Metropolitan Museum of Art (located a block away), and other institutions in New York City, including Columbia University and the New York Public Library. They are provided with their own carrel workspace.



A research account is provided to defray the cost of travel to conferences and other research expenses.



Research Scholar positions are available to scholars of all post-PhD career stages, from recently minted PhDs to retired academics. Current doctoral students in their final year of dissertation work are also welcome to apply, but please note that official conferral of the PhD must take place prior to the start-date of the position (September 1, 2025).



The application must be completed in Interfolio and should include a cover letter, CV (including publication list), a research proposal, three letters of recommendation, and a writing sample (either a published article or dissertation chapter). Applicants must also complete a researcher profile form and an EEO form in Interfolio. Letters of recommendation from ISAW faculty and staff are not permitted.



The application deadline is November 20th, 2024. Applicants will be prompted in Interfolio to submit the names and email addresses of three referees; please be sure to do so before the November 20th deadline. Referees will be contacted via email and asked to submit their letters of recommendation electronically via Interfolio; they will have until December 1st to submit the letters.



Applicants will receive a system-generated confirmation email from Interfolio when they have successfully submitted their application. If you do not receive this email, that likely means that you have not successfully submitted your application. We are NOT able to review in-progress applications in Interfolio, so please make sure that you have successfully submitted your application prior to the November 20th deadline.



Late submissions will not be accepted. Please plan accordingly.

### **Description**

The McDevitt laboratory at New York University has a long tradition of developing new medical microdevice technologies that are suitable for early disease detection. In this general area, a MEGA grant sponsored by the NIDCR division of the NIH has been awarded recently with the goal of developing next generation cytomics-on-a-chip tools for oral cancer diagnosis. This multi-institution prospective cohort study seeks to utilize and optimize first Point-of-Care Oral Cytopathology Tool (POCOCT), a microfluidics ensemble and single cell image-based data acquisition system employing artificial intelligence with interpretation of >100 image features including nuclear F-actin for precision oral lesion diagnostics to be completed. Portable diagnostic tools and embedded algorithms will be optimized for secondary and tertiary care settings for the first time. In this study, POCOCT-derived oral cancer and oral dysplasia models will be developed to elucidate population and patient-specific dynamic changes in numerical index that yield key information related to cancer recurrence (CR) and risk of malignant transition (MT). The overarching goals of this study are: (1) to determine whether cytological signatures, when examined serially over time, can lead to better risk prediction for CR, (2) to determine if the same signatures can lead to earlier detection of local recurrence than the traditional clinical pathway, and (3) to further optimize the POCOCT for precision lesion diagnostics of MT and CR using newly identified biomarkers, including nuclear F-actin, and rare cell phenotypes identified by deep learning. This prospective longitudinal cohort study has potential for more accurate lesion diagnosis, improving patient survival and overall quality of life.



The McDevitt laboratory at NYU now offers an exciting opportunity to join the study team as an Associate Research Scientist / Research Technologist position. The successful candidate will participate in studies that aim to develop novel cytopathology diagnostic tools suitable for oral lesion diagnosis. The project will be fast-paced and multi-disciplinary and provide strong career development and learning opportunities. The Associate Research Scientist / Research Technologist will be responsible for performing a variety of essential laboratory experiments under general supervision, as well as more advanced duties under direct supervision. The Associate Research Scientist / Research Technologist will work closely with senior McDevitt lab personnel in advanced procedures and contribute the organization of the lab.



Job Responsibilities:


* Core Functions - One of the main functions of this position is to complete cytopathology tests using established chip-based cell imaging procedures while documenting the obtained findings. Careful documentation of patient cell-based image data will serve as the basis for development of new clinical procedures to diagnose oral cancer at an earlier stage than possible now via the current standard of care.

### **Open Date**

Jun 12, 2024
### **Description**

Our cities were built in response to yesterday’s problems. As the world faces rising populations, climate change, and economic challenges, communities can’t afford to wait until after the next hurricane or flood, or ignore chronic stresses such as aging infrastructure and pollution, to plan for the future. Rebuild By Design is reimagining the way communities find solutions for today’s large-scale, complex problems.  



Rebuild by Design convenes a mix of sectors to gain a better understanding of how overlapping environmental and human-made vulnerabilities leave cities and regions at risk. Rebuild’s core belief is that through collaboration our communities can grow stronger and better prepared to stand up to whatever challenges tomorrow brings. Rebuild’s collaborative research and design approach is helping cities around the globe achieve resilience.  



In November 2022, Rebuild by Design released a report identifying county-level disaster impacts and costs over the past decade. The report, Atlas of Disaster, found that 90% of counties in the U.S. have experienced a recent major disaster declaration due to extreme weather and offered solutions for investing in climate adaptation with a community-centered process.  



The Atlas of Disaster aims to build awareness of the impacts of climate change on communities across the country, to mobilize investments in resilient infrastructure, and calls for reforms to federal disaster declaration policy. Rebuild by Design is now building off of the report to compile state-specific climate impact reports that can be used to support statewide adaptation policies and practices.  



Rebuild by Design seeks to hire a highly motivated part-time Research Design Assistant to help with the production of these reports, among other content, through desktop research and graphic design. A sample report can be found here.



Responsibilities:

Working under the Director of Rebuild by Design, the Assistant will help create Climate Impact Reports as well as other research and design projects.



Research
* Research localized climate impacts, projections, policies, and solutions
* Identify key statistics that can support a compelling argument for state coalitions, media, and decision-makers to use to advocate for climate adaptation investments
* Research what is already happening on the state level to determine model legislation and opportunities for reform
* Understand what public data is available and determine how we can use the data to communicate our messaging in reports, maps, and one-pagers
* Share research with local organizations, policy makers and the public

Design and Mapping
* The creation and production of localized reports in InDesign
* The creation of localized data and maps for each of the 50 states
* Build maps for reports and Rebuild's website

  


The project will be approximately 15 hours a week.

### **Description**

The Center on Civil Justice is conducting a search for an executive director to be in charge of all activities of the Center. He or she will work with the Center’s faculty co-directors and the chair of the advisory board. In its decade at NYU, the Center has had two directors, Peter Zimroth and the Honorable Beverly Martin. They have led the Center into important work on litigation finance, issues in complex litigation, the impact of debt collection and other high volume litigation on poorer citizens, the evolving field of antitrust enforcement, and the impact of AI on the legal profession – among others. The work takes the form of conferences, research projects and coordinated programs with the judiciary and the bar. An overview is provided on the Center’s website: http://www.law.nyu.edu/centers/civiljustice



From its inception, the Center on Civil Justice at New York University School of Law has been dedicated to the study of the present functioning and future prospects of the civil litigation system in the United States. The Center is designed to fill a void in scholarly and policy analysis and to draw on the unmatched strengths of NYU in the field of procedure and complex litigation, as well as a board of advisors composed of leading practitioners and judges.



This has been a particularly suitable time for NYU Law School to host this Center. The legal profession is now roughly seventy-five years into the modern era of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP). For all the promise of the FRPC to cut through the technical, non-merits forms of action of the common law period, the hoped for ""just, speedy, and inexpensive"" adjudication of disputes appears an increasingly distant vision. Our legal world is far more complex than the FRCP could ever have envisioned.



In our current world economy, even routine transactions can implicate legal oversight by many different jurisdictions-local, national, and multi-national-all with their own administrative, statutory, and adjudicatory regimes. The complications and costs of adjudication have bloated. This, in turn, has meant that large groups of litigants have been forced to defend themselves in hugely consequential litigations (e.g., home foreclosures, deportations) in a system they cannot afford; others with legitimate claims cannot afford to assert them; and still others, who have substantial resources, complain about the excessive costs of litigation and the destructive effect on business and competitiveness.



The goal of the Center on Civil Justice is to look realistically at the factors that have stressed our civil justice system, and to provide a forum for research, discussion, and writing on ways that the needs of the participants in our justice system can be more satisfactorily met, while preserving the values essential to maintain the civil justice system's station as one of the great pillars of our democracy. The Center joins scholars, practicing lawyers, judges, court administrators, and other interested participants and encourages them to explore anew the role that litigation plays in our legal system, the values that need to be preserved, and what can be done in the modern age to preserve them.



The Center on Civil Justice follows the same principles as the other successful Centers already in place at NYU. The Center's goal is to provide a fertile environment for scholarly inquiry, leveraging the practical insight and experience of practitioners, judges, and administrators. Toward that end, the Center conducts research; organizes conferences drawing on law professors, practitioners, and judges; provides a unique forum for the discussion and debate of proposed civil justice reforms, and seeks ways to follow these discussions and debates with concrete proposals or projects.



The Center operates under the direction of an Executive Director and our resident faculty directors, Professors Samuel Issacharoff, Arthur Miller, Geoffrey Miller, and Troy McKenzie (on leave to serve as the Dean of the law school). In addition, the Center has an advisory board made up of leading practicing lawyers, each in his or her individual capacity, drawn from the plaintiffs' bar and the defense bar, as well as leading members of the judiciary. The chair of the board of advisors is Sheila Birnbaum, who is serving as Interim Director during the search for a new director.


**Salary:**



In compliance with NYC's Pay Transparency Act, the annual base salary range for this position is $143,000-$213,000. New York University considers factors such as (but not limited to) scope and responsibilities of the position, candidate's work experience, education/training, key skills, internal peer equity, as well as market and organizational considerations when extending an offer.This position comes with a competitive salary and a generous array of benefits, which include medical, dental and vision.

Are you passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning? Are you passionate about helping customers build solutions leveraging the state-of-the-art AI/ML/DL tools on Amazon Web Service (AWS)? Come join us!
  
  

At Amazon, we’ve been investing deeply in artificial intelligence for over 20 years, and many of the capabilities customers experience in our products are driven by machine learning. Amazon.com’s recommendations engine is driven by machine learning (ML), as are the paths that optimize robotic picking routes in our fulfillment centers. Our supply chain, forecasting, and capacity planning are also informed by ML algorithms. Alexa is fueled by Natural Language Understanding and Automated Speech Recognition deep learning; as is Prime Air, and the computer vision technology in our new retail experience, Amazon Go. We have thousands of engineers at Amazon committed to machine learning and deep learning, and it’s a big part of our heritage.
  
  

Within AWS, we’re focused on bringing that knowledge and capability to customers through three layers of the AI stack: 1) Frameworks and Infrastructure with tools like Apache MxNet and TensorFlow, 2) Machine Learning Platforms such as Amazon SageMaker for data scientists, and, 3) API-driven Services like Amazon Lex, Amazon Polly, Amazon Transcribe, Amazon Comprehend, and Amazon Rekognition to quickly add intelligence to applications with a simple API call.
  
  

AWS is looking for a Machine Learning Solutions Architect (ML SA), who will be the Subject Matter Expert (SME) for helping technology customers (Retail and Consumer Packaged Goods, GreenField, Startups, etc.) design solutions that leverage our ML services. As part of the team, you will work closely with customers to enable large-scale use cases, design ML pipelines, and drive the adoption of AWS for the AI/ML platforms. You will interact with other SAs in the field, providing guidance on their customer engagements, and you will develop white papers, blogs, reference implementations, and presentations to enable customers to fully leverage AI/ML on AWS. Additionally, as the voice of the customer, you will work closely with the service teams, and submit product feature requests to drive the platform forward.
  
  

You must have deep technical experience working with technologies related to artificial intelligence, machine learning and/or deep learning. A strong mathematics and statistics background is preferred in addition to experience building complex machine learning models. You will be familiar with the ecosystem of software vendors in the AI/ML space, and will leverage this knowledge to help AWS customers in their selection process.
  
  

Roles and Responsibilities - Working with customers’ development and data science teams to deeply understand their business and technical needs. After understanding their needs, you will design solutions that make the best use of the AWS cloud platform and AWS AI/ML Services including SageMaker, Amazon Comprehend, Amazon Rekognition, Amazon Transcribe, Amazon Lex, Amazon Polly, Amazon Forecast, Amazon Personalize, and the other AI/ML services.
  
* Partner with SAs, Sales, Business Development and the AI/ML Service teams to accelerate customer adoption and revenue attainment in the AMERICAS for Amazon SageMaker.
* Thought Leadership – Evangelize AWS ML services and share best practices through forums such as AWS blogs, whitepapers, reference architectures and public-speaking events such as AWS Summit, AWS re: Invent, etc.
* Act as a technical liaison between customers and the AWS SageMaker services teams to provide customer driven product improvement feedback.
* Develop and support an AWS internal community of ML related subject matter experts in the AMERICAS.

Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 16 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.
