Beyond that, here’s how you’ll make your mark:

* Delivering high-quality media planning for clients, serving up a smart, thoughtful understanding of how digital marketing can achieve (and exceed) objectives and goals – you’ll lend this expertise to new business pitches, too
* Performing thorough, insightful campaign analysis, including reporting and optimization recommendations
* Partner with cross-functional teams – paid social, programmatic, data and analytics, media technology and business operations – to deliver best in class media recommendations and execute flawlessly

**How you’ll grow with us:**


Media Supervisor is where you’ll start, but we’re always planning for where you’ll go. Our Media Supervisors are all expected to hone skills that will help build on their careers. Those skills include:

This isn’t all pool tables and Bagel Fridays — it’s about giving you the support to do and be your best. Examples include the ability to work wherever (forever), unlimited PTO, and self-care stipends. We also love to let loose, whether through selfie scavenger hunts or bouts of companywide bingo that would shock even the rowdiest retirement communities.

**3. Fostering a Diverse & Caring Community**


We’re the most diverse agency in healthcare, by design. No matter your story, you’ll find representation and amplification — through our affinity groups, cultural celebrations, and unwavering support no matter what society throws at us.

The name “Silver Lining” is rooted in crisis theory and the idea that though crisis is unpleasant, difficult and traumatic, the result is always change. That change can be positive with help, support and guidance. That is exactly what our clinicians do: assist children and their families to navigate through their crisis, achieve stability, and find or create positive outcomes from whatever storm has come their way. Issues we assist families with include (but are not limited to) mental health, behavioral problems, family conflict, and parenting difficulties.

Silver Lining was founded by Chrissy Webber, a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW) and trauma specialist who has served the children and families of Sussex and Morris counties since 2008 in various capacities, including non-profit child protection work, outpatient mental health, private practice, and school social work.

At Silver Lining we have high standards of excellence for our staff, and we care just as deeply about staff wellbeing as we do the clients we serve. Chrissy, our founder, provides training and clinical supervision herself (free of charge) for those who are working toward their LCSW or LPC, and is always on call should clinicians need assistance in between formal supervision sessions or while in the field. Chrissy is an experienced certified clinical supervisor for both disciplines, and has assisted many clinicians to achieve their independent licensure. We support our clinicians’ professional development by providing access to CEU training opportunities offered through NJ Children’s System of Care (CSOC) at no charge.

We invite each of our clinicians to choose how many clients they would like to take on, the geographic location in which they would like to work, the ages of children/youth with whom they feel comfortable working, and the types of presenting problems which are within the scope of their training & expertise. This could be a full- or part-time position; the choice is yours! Please note, it is necessary for applicants to be willing to meet with clients in person in order to facilitate a consistent caseload.

A position with our practice is ideal for those who are looking for a home-based, flexible schedule. Working parents, people looking to supplement a full time position elsewhere (whether the need is financial or for extra clinical hours), clinicians new to the field, and others have all found their work at Silver Lining meaningful, fulfilling, helpful to their professional growth, and productive in working toward their professional goals.

Intensive In-Community counselors provide 1-2 hour sessions each week to each client, whether they choose to travel to the child/youth’s home or elsewhere in the community, or hold sessions via telehealth.

**Intensive In-Community Counselor Job responsibilities:**

* Provide short-term individual or family therapy to children/youth age 2-21 and their families
* Complete assessments and treatment plans for each client
* Maintain progress notes and other HIPAA compliant documentation required by the NJCSOC
* Collaborate with children/youth case managers, DCP&P workers, and other professionals who may be involved with the child/youth

**Hourly Pay Rates:**

LCSW/LPC: $91/hour

LSW: $64/hour (clinical supervision included at no cost)

If you are interested in joining our supportive, professional team of clinicians, **please include cover letter and resume.**

**JOB DESCRIPTION**

  



**About Mobile Health**



Mobile Health is a market leader in occupational health and employment-related screening services across the United States. With five owned-and-operated clinics in New York City, and over 6,500 affiliated locations, Mobile Health sees millions of patients per year. Our comprehensive services include drug testing, physicals, respirator fit testing, hearing testing, vision screening, vaccines and titers, and more. We stack hands to support our B2B client partners and are on a mission to make occupational health and employment-related screening the easiest part of their job. To achieve that, we are leveraging technology to change how occupational health is delivered. As a technology-driven company, we’re at the forefront of unleashing new and better ways to keep businesses safe and their employees healthy. Mobile Health is growing, and we are looking for amazing people to join our team!

  


**Location:** NYC- Hybrid (This role will require 3 days a week in the NYC market)  

This position includes travel locally. Additional travel to corporate headquarters for meetings and training may be necessary. Company-related travel, outside of the standard commute, will be reimbursed.


**Hours of Operation**



Full-Time Monday through Friday with occasional weekend hours.


**Salary**  

**$60,000-80,000 plus commission plan**


**DO MORE. BE MORE.**

**BE A REGIONAL SALES EXECUTIVE AT MOBILE HEALTH**

  



First things first — we’re not your normal business. Mobile Health is a healthcare and technology company with big ambitions. We look at each day with the energy and spirit of a start-up and an insatiable hunger to never stop doing great things.

  



That’s why we’ve disrupted the occupational health industry ever since we began in 1984, and continue to do so with our game-changing technology, and new approaches to meeting our clients’ pre-employment and compliance testing needs.

  




We’re expanding across the United States with more than 6,500 clinics, a mobile fleet, and the ability to deliver care on-site, at our client's doorstep. We’re changing the way companies think about employee health and safety. We work hard to create a world where occupational health and employee screening is an open door to growth. Our dedication is real. You can feel the passion and enthusiasm. We break barriers. We’re the solution the industry desperately needs. We need great thinkers, activators, strategists, and managers who want to share in our passion to get things done.

  




Do we sound like the kind of company — and culture — you’re looking for? Are you in a sales role today and want to move on to do the best work of your life? If you’re ready to join us, we can’t wait to meet you. Read on to learn more about Mobile Health and our Regional Sales Executive role.

  


**STEP UP. STEP IN. OWN IT.**



As the CEO of your market, we expect you to engage in high-profile client relationships to execute your sales strategy. You are the driving force in a large territory and will be an integral part of our National Sales Team to deliver results. We’ll give you all the autonomy you could ever ask for, underpinned by the support you need to be successful. No micro-managers here — we want you to step up, step in, and own it.

  


**WHAT YOUR DAY WILL LOOK LIKE**



If you’re currently in a sales role — in any industry — you know that your day is all about finding opportunities where there’s an amazing marriage between what the client needs and what we have to offer. You’re advocating for your client, going to bat to find a great solution, and developing relationships with long-term value. That means your day looks like this:

  


* You’re developing a pipeline of opportunities based on a strategic territory plan and collaborating with leadership to support you.


* Reaching out and making friends, turning “no’s” into “yeses” and showing the company’s unique solutions tailored to our client’s needs.


* You’re a go-to, trusted expert. When the client says, “I’m not sure who can solve this….?” you would be the first person they call.


* You’re a visible member of speaking panels, trade shows, conferences, and any other event where your community of prospects are meeting to talk.


* You love Salesforce so much you could cry. Well, maybe not, but you get the idea. You’ll be keeping Salesforce up to date with all client and deal information.


* You’re preparing quotes, pricing, and assisting with RFIs or RFPs.

  


**CARE AND LOVE**



And we will take care of you. You’ll be working with colleagues who are passionate and driven to succeed. You’ll learn from the best. And we expect your best each day. We provide a generous compensation package, great benefits, a remote work environment, and everything you need to be successful. Did we mention an unlimited PTO policy? Technically, we call it our “responsible use” policy, meaning, don’t ruin it for everyone. We expect you to work hard. And we expect you to live your life.

  


**WHY DO WE NEED YOU?**



Mobile Health continues to grow. Rapidly. And the key to your success is our success. We think of our Sales Executives as the tip of the spear. Our Marketing Team will deliver you leads, and you’ll be hunting for them on your own. We can’t do this alone, which is why we need you to help us continue our growth. We’ll rely on you to create your own strategies and business plans to:


* Expand market share and adoption of our products and services within a specific territory.
* Be an advocate for Mobile Health and the great work we do every day.
* Build a sales pipeline that you’ll be proud of and will reward you with generous compensation.

  


**DOES THIS SOUND LIKE YOU?**



We want people who are skilled relationship developers, have an entrepreneurial spirit, and approach everything they do with passion. We’re looking for a respected professional who exhibits keen business instincts, is creative, and above all, has the ability to drive results. You could be a great fit if you have:


* A persuasive, energetic, independent operator mindset who can earn and retain a “seat at the table.”


* Strong planning skills to focus on an individual territory.


* Comfortable dealing with — and managing in — an extremely fluid, fast-paced environment (we don’t stop around here…. it’s a driving force of our company DNA)


* Amazing communication skills, optimism, and confidence

  


**SKILL SET vs. PRIOR EXPERIENCE**



We’re all about looking for the right people. If you have a go-getter, sales skillset, but have never worked in healthcare, that’s ok! We want you to apply! Sales Executives with a few years’ experience are great. If you believe in yourself, can show us what you’re made of, and feel inspired after reading this job post, then we want you to apply.
