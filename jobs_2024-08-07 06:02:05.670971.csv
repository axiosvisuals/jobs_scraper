Seton Education Partners seeks a mission-driven, results-oriented individual to be the founding Python Developer & Analyst for the Brilla Schools Network. We are looking for a resourceful, organized and highly efficient team member who will maintain and extend our internal Python codebase; generate regressions, projections, and other analyses; and help implement data and analytics tactics and processes across the organization. The Developer will report to the Chief Schools Officer and collaborate with other network staff in order to transform our data into actionable insights. This is an onsite position.

**About Seton Education Partners**


Co-founded in 2009 by KIPP pioneer Scott W. Hamilton and Teach for America alumna Stephanie Saroki de García, Seton Education Partners is a response to the dramatic decline of urban Catholic schools in America, which have served the economically disadvantaged so well for decades.


In 2013, amidst the shuttering of 60+ urban Catholic schools in the Archdiocese of New York, Seton launched Brilla College Prep Public Charter School in the Mott Haven neighborhood of the South Bronx. Brilla, which means “shine” in Spanish, has achieved academic results that parallel the nation’s most acclaimed high-poverty schools. Alongside Brilla, Seton launched El Camino, an optional, privately funded extended-day Catholic faith formation program. In only five years, 99 children have been baptized through their participation in El Camino.


Seton is working to take these remarkable achievements to scale by managing a network of schools and programs that ensure that thousands of underserved children whose Catholic schools close—and other local children—have access to an academically excellent, character-building, and, for those who choose it, faith-nurturing education. This network is a national model for how other cities facing the shuttering of Catholic schools can continue to serve children and families with limited educational options. For more information on Seton Education Partners, please visit www.SetonPartners.org.

**About the Brilla Schools Network**


Brilla Public Charter Schools is a network of K-8th grade schools that currently serves around 1,900 students from Mott Haven, University Heights, and other neighborhoods in the Bronx. The network, which currently includes four elementary and two middle schools, will soon be adding two additional middle schools; once all schools are fully enrolled, the network will serve over 3,000 students in the Bronx. Core to our mission is that our students become young men and women of good character and spirit and be prepared for excellence in high school, college, and beyond. Brilla combines a classical approach to education - an emphasis on virtue formation, Truth, Beauty, and Goodness, and direct instruction of a content-rich curriculum that has stood the test of time - with co-teaching practices and individualized online learning. We approach the formation of our students holistically and also set high academic expectations. Ours is a joyful community that honors the dignity of each student, family member and staff.

**About El Camino Network**


El Camino, which means “The Way” in Spanish, is an optional, privately-funded Catholic after-school faith formation program that is closely partnered with Brilla charter schools. El Camino helps children, their families and their catechists to know, love and serve Christ and His Church; develop the habits, dispositions and beliefs that are indispensable to human flourishing and happiness; and live as disciples in this world and saints in the next. El Camino honors the teaching authority of the Catholic Church.


El Camino currently serves approximately 30% of Brilla’s students across all grades for 90 minutes a day, Monday through Thursday. Children receive homework help from experienced teachers, a nutritious snack, and 30 minutes each of catechism and physical fitness. Additionally, children and families have opportunities for shared and personal prayer and character formation. This video provides a snapshot of El Camino.  

  

**About the Position**


Reporting to the Chief Schools Officer or the Senior Director of Data Management & Strategy, the Python Developer and Analyst will be in charge of Seton’s Python codebase. This codebase allows Seton to efficiently retrieve student and staff data from numerous sources; merge them together; generate analyses; and export data to SFTP servers and our internal PostgreSQL database. The Developer will be tasked with both maintaining existing code and adding in additional scripts to meet new needs and data retrieval requests. These additional scripts may produce regression analyses; projections; descriptive statistics; and visualizations.


The Developer will also manage a server that runs many of these scripts on a scheduled basis, thus providing network and school leaders with access to accurate and up-to-date data. He or she will also maintain Seton’s local PostgreSQL database. In addition, the developer will be tasked with running scripts as needed in order to import new sets of test results, surveys, and other files into our database.


The Analytics Developer role will manage and deliver on short and long-term data initiatives and projects across all departments, working in close collaboration with the senior leadership team and school-based staff. This position will report directly to the Chief Schools Officer.


Key job responsibilities:

**Data and Analytics Development**

* Maintain and extend internal Python codebase in order to efficiently and accurately transfer data between systems; retrieve student and staff metrics from PowerSchool, Centrally, and other sites; generate analyses; create visualizations; identify anomalies within student information system records; and load data into database that powers Tableau dashboards
* Oversee local server that runs Python scripts; quickly identify and resolve issues that arise so as to ensure that data output remains accurate and up-to-date
* Monitor, update, and extend Google Sheets workbooks that store output of certain Python scripts
* Review online documentation for guidance on incorporating new libraries into codebase
* Control costs by proposing and implementing open-source solutions when feasible
* Safeguard staff and student data

 **Project Management and Documentation**

* Generate project plans that specify when various elements of programming projects will be completed; keep these plans up to date as project scopes and timelines change
* Work with stakeholders to determine appropriate specifications for new development projects
* Manage time wisely in order to balance long-term projects with short-term data requests. Weigh the time and effort involved in developing a new script against the work it might save in the future
* Maintain documentation on Seton’s codebase, including an overview of Seton’s Python scripts; lists of steps that must be completed to carry out a given data-related task; and flowcharts that visualize data processing tasks
* Keep codebase clear and intuitive for both current and future users by adding adequate documentation and comments within scripts

 **Schools Team Involvement**

* Meet regularly with Chief Schools Officer, data team members, and Director of Operations
* Collaborate with Business Systems Analyst to update the scripts underlying Brilla’s Tableau dashboards
* Serve as a programming expert within the schools team who can speak realistically and clearly about Python’s suitability for various projects and initiatives

**Qualifications and Desired Characteristics**

**Candidates for the position must possess the following personal characteristics:**

* Unquestioned integrity and commitment to Seton’s mission and values
* Unquestioned integrity and commitment to Brilla’s mission, including its commitment to a classically inspired curriculum and character formation
* Personal responsibility with humility
* A relentless drive for excellence
* A strong belief that all children can achieve both moral and academic excellence
* An unwavering determination to be better today than you were yesterday

**The ideal candidate will bring experience and skills in the following areas:**

* Results orientation and the ability to get things done well
* Ability to adapt in a fluid, start-up environment
* Optimism, perseverance, and a focus on problem-solving
* Ability to self-direct and prioritize competing goals and exhibit flexibility in a fast-paced, entrepreneurial environment

* Strong command of Python and the Pandas library; experience with Selenium, Folium, Plotly, Gspread, SQLAlchemy, and Statsmodels libraries; familiarity with SQL

* Ability to analyze, manipulate, visualize, and present large amounts of data while maintaining data integrity
* Experience designing data structures and systems for efficiency and perpetuity
* Clear communicator, strong writer, and innovative thinker who can transform conceptual ideas and initiatives into practical and easily executable plans
* Experience with both Linux and Windows preferred
* 3+ years of experience on a data analysis or data science team
* Experience working in a charter school environment a plus

**Diversity & Inclusivity**


We are building an organization in which talented individuals from all walks of life and past work experiences can join our team and make significant contributions. We are particularly committed to attracting and developing individuals who share the life experiences or backgrounds of the students we will serve.

* *At Brilla, education in the classical tradition is understood to mean the education of the whole person - mind, body and spirit - in the service of human flourishing. People flourish by living out the virtues. A time proven way of learning how to live out the virtues is to learn about, contemplate and discuss how these virtues have been expressed by fictional and nonfictional people throughout history represented in time-tested works.*

*Secondarily, a classical education is pedagogically consistent with modern cognitive science. Many current pedagogies are not fully consistent with what we know today about brain development. In contrast, classical pedagogy (referred to as the Trivium) perfectly corresponds to how the brain develops. It emphasizes patterns, routines, and facts that young brains crave (Grammar stage); It leverages the brain’s orientation to asking “why” in the middle years (Logic stage); And it focuses on communication and persuasion in the high school years (Rhetoric stage).*

**To Apply**


Initial application materials include: a cover letter, contact information for three references, and a resume that includes information on your background and development experience. You are also encouraged to share links to programming and data analysis projects that you have created.


Resumes without cover letters will not be reviewed.

*Seton Education Partners provides equal employment opportunity for all applicants and employees.*


The pay range for this position is $80,000-$100,000 per year. Pay may vary within the stated range, depending on job-related knowledge, skills, and experience. A sign-on bonus for some roles may be provided as part of the compensation package subject to executive leadership approval, in addition to a full range of medical, financial, and/or other benefits, depending on the position offered.
