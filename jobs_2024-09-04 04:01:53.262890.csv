Leveraging project management and relationship management skills, you bring the right partners to the table from technology, product, business, operations, and other areas, and ensure the timelines for gathering and delivery of the details are met. Being more of a specialist or technical expert, you might also complete configurations within different applications to enable new products, customer setups, and other changes.

* Advocate for the business, reducing the amount of time required from the business SMEs
* Raise risks and dependencies that may create impediments down the line, solutioning next steps to overcome
