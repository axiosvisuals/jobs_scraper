It all started with one big dream, two crazy cousins, and the perfect combination of flour, sugar, and chocolate chips. Crumbl was co-founded by Jason McGowan (CEO) & Sawyer Hemsley (COO). They both teamed up and dove head-first into the world of baking. After thousands of dollars in wasted dough, recipes that did not live up to their expectations, and cookies that are just plain embarrassing to them today, the two cousins decided to take their 'perfect cookie quest' to the people. They gathered feedback and tested recipes — a practice that is still part of the Crumbl process — until they created the world’s best chocolate chip cookie.

Young Life Military is looking for those with a heart to serve and a desire to grow in their walks with Christ. We are excited for you to consider the possibility of joining us for a long-term internship. Our interns are accepted through Young Life and will work with an experienced Young Life Military/Club Beyond staff person. Interns have the opportunity to serve either in the United States or in Europe. The Club Beyond supervising staff person gives direction and trains the intern as they assist with many aspects of the ministry. Activities include camps, clubs, Bible studies as well as just ""hanging out"" with kids and modeling a personal example of Jesus Christ. A desire to love and serve kids should be a priority.


This is where you can be the difference in a military teen’s life! By being in their world, walking alongside them, and creating a community where they experience the truth of God’s love and purpose for them, our staff provide a safe space where teens can develop friendships and connections to experience laughter, build hope, and generate resiliency.


We are currently providing incarnational ministry at many military installations around the world. You will have the opportunity to lead and oversee the overall Young Life Military program, known as Club Beyond, which is ecumenically focused and outreach oriented.

* **Leadership Development:** Attend volunteer leader meetings. Meet weekly with one volunteer to discuss their involvement in Club Beyond. Meet with your supervisor and learn how to recruit and train new leaders and build a leadership team that reflects the diversity of the community.
* **Resource Development:** Discuss with your supervisor raising financial support, both the benefits and the challenges. Communicate monthly updates with personal donor partners.
* Be a role model (incarnational/relational ministry) and assist with developing community outreach to ""unchurched"" teens, discipleship to believing teens, and leading and equipping volunteers for ""hands-on"" middle and high school Christian youth ministry.
* Be respectful of and embrace a community that is deeply influenced by a military culture.
* In this ministry, you will need to live out the Club Beyond Core Value Statement:

*Club Beyond is a Christ-centered community of leaders with an exclusively military focus. Our methods are incarnational, and our perspective is ecumenical. We leverage strategic partnerships for the greatest results. We value professionalism from our staff and excellence in our stewardship.*

**Qualifications:**

* **Graduated high school at least 2 years prior**
* A deep love for Christ and for lost teens.
* Competent communicator.
* Teachable heart.
* Willingness to raise part of the budget through personal support.
* Committed to a relational ministry approach.
* Energetic.
* Small event planning skills.
* Strong initiative.
* **Note, this position would require our Staff to live near the community where they would be doing ministry.**
