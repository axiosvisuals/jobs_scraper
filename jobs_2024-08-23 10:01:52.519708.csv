**THE ROLE**
The Motor Vehicle Examiner positions are for Branch Operations, where incumbents will be working in a fast-paced environment with a high volume of customer contact and money handling.  

  

*We are looking for detail-oriented people with excellent customer service skills!*  

  

These positions will assist with the intake of customers and will perform a wide range of motor vehicle transactions and should be proficient with operating computer systems and data entry. Incumbents may be required to work in other branch locations and may be required to work overtime based on agency needs.  

  

  

**CAREER TRAJECTORY & EMPLOYEE SPOTLIGHT**  

  

*Working for the DMV for 23 years has been very rewarding. I started as a clerk and now as a Division Manager. Through the years I have enjoyed working in many branch offices in which I have gained knowledge and experience with the different types of transactions. Assisting customers when they have a problem and then resolving their issues is the best feeling, knowing the customer is happy when they walk away from your counter. Even the most difficult times at the DMV are easier to get through when you’re working with great people. The DMV is very diverse in nature. You will work with co-workers and customers with different backgrounds. I recommend the DMV to anyone beginning their career.*
***-******Kathleen Martinez – MV Division Manager***  

  

*I have been with the DMV for 12 years. During my 12 years of employment, the DMV has afforded me many opportunities and I have been promoted 4 times during my tenure. Currently, I am the Hub Manager for the Norwalk and Stamford branches. “Teamwork is dream work” is what is all about at the DMV. Everyone is always helping each other and going above and beyond for each other and for our customers. Working with the public can be challenging at times, but it is equally if not, more rewarding. Navigating through the many statues and laws at the DMV is especially difficult for the customers. It is always a rewarding feeling when you take the time to explain thoroughly the needs of the customer and help them understand and complete their transaction. One of my favorite parts of working at the DMV and the public is the diversity. We help every single walk of life, every culture, every background which helps you gain more perspective and appreciation for the world in which we live in. Every customer that walks through the door is treated with equal respect, no matter what their background, and I love that part of the job.*
***-******Sheri Scinto – Motor Vehicle Hub Branch Manager***  

  

I have been employed by the DMV for almost fifteen years. As I enter the office every morning I am greeted with smiling faces and a “good morning” from my wonderful coworkers.
I never expected to be here for fifteen years, but the opportunities the DMV has to offer is hard to resist.
Working extensively with the public and the staff, I have truly experienced the many diverse cultures of Connecticut. Yes, customer service sometimes requires patience, but most people are just looking for a little kindness and respect as they try to navigate the DMV. Changing a frustrated customer into a thankful customer is very rewarding.
I would definitely recommend taking the opportunity to work at the DMV for the summer. Come enjoy the people of Connecticut and see what the DMV has to offer you.
