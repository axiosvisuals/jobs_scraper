Buddy Web Design & Development is a growing, entrepreneurial, and award-winning website design and development company headquartered in the Grand Rapids, Michigan area. Buddy has built a portfolio of clients across the United States, and is currently seeking help to grow the business by identifying and helping to secure new client projects.

Buddy is seeking an independent contractor who can spearhead sales and, in particular, lead-generation activities, including prospecting, outreach, and qualifying new sales leads. This work can be done remotely and part time, according to a schedule of your choosing.

While Buddy has traditionally offered high-quality website design and development and graphic design services for small- and mid-sized clients across a variety of industries, we're excited to add some additional new services and targeted opportunities this year. In particular, Buddy is adding to its service offering ongoing website support and maintenance plans, as well as ""all-in-one"" plans where Buddy designs, builds, and launches a new website for clients, and then takes care of ongoing hosting, maintenance, monitoring, updates, and edit requests, all for a low monthly fee, rather than the more traditional ""lump sum"" payment structure. We are excited about both these maintenance and all-in-one packages opening the doors to new prospective clients.

Further, Buddy is launching more targeted marketing efforts for these all-in-one plans, focusing initially on blue collar trades (buddywdd.com/tr) and healthcare practices (buddywdd.com/hc).

We're excited to partner with an experienced sales individual to help champion sales efforts for these new initiatives. An ideal person for this opportunity will have an entrepreneurial mindset, friendly and outgoing personality, and high degree of professionalism and integrity, coupled with a comfort and willingness to identify and reach out to prospective clients and build mutually beneficial relationships.

5+ years of business-to-business sales experience and a record of success is required, particularly in a sales role where you were required to generate your own leads, rather than working off a provided sales prospect list or via inbound leads.

The minimum and maximum base hourly wage for this position is $19.88. This base pay does not include additional forms of compensation including bonuses, overtime, etc. **Role Description**


The purpose of a Medical Scribe at Oak Street Health is to support our primary care providers with clinical documentation so that they can focus on providing exceptional care to our patients. Scribes assist providers throughout the patient care journey - huddling each morning to plan for the day's visits, joining them in the exam room to observe and document, and touching base after the visit to assist with next steps.

  

Beyond the typical Scribe role, these important care team members serve as clinical documentation assistants to their paired provider. Internally, we call them CISs (Clinic Informatics Specialists) in recognition of their important role in supporting accurate, specific, and timely clinical documentation. In addition to observing and documenting all patient encounters in real time, our Scribes become experts in our value-based care model and the documentation and care of chronic conditions, including ICD-10 and CPT coding. Scribes use this expertise to help providers identify and help close care gaps. Scribes receive extensive on-the-job training in clinical workflows, value-based medicine, preventative care for chronic conditions, accurate and specific documentation, population health data streams, and team based care.

  

Because our patients and providers rely on our Scribes, the ideal candidate should commit at least 1-2 years to this role. This is an excellent opportunity for pre-med track individuals looking to gain practical, paid experience in a clinical setting before applying to an MD/DO/PA/NP program, as well as those pursuing careers in Health Informatics, Public Health, Healthcare Administration, Medical Coding, and other related fields.
