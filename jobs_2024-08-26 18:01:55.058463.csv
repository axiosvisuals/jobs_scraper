* Assist investigators (physicians) to prepare and implement new clinical trials, screens and enrolls study participants, and provides protocol-related clinical management to those participants while on study.
* This is NOT a typical nursing role that is task-based, and tasks dictated by physicians. The Nurse has to be a critical thinker, to prioritize, and be “appropriately assertive” and comfortable pushing back on physicians to “save them from themselves” – looking at study protocol and see are orders all correct as it relates to medical record, is anything missing, does the patient have what they need?
* The role will follow group assignments. The Physicians have designated clinic days. These are the days the Nurses will see more patients. On non-clinic days, the Nurse will see less patients and perform administrative tasks including patient documentation, patient phone calls, making sure orders are correct (ensuring nothing is missing) and perform project management related activities.

* Reviews patient’s charts and medical history to confirm protocol eligibility and obtains source documents (i.e., medical record documentation) as needed.

**Required Skills:*** Graduate from an accredited school of nursing with a license to practice in the State of New Jersey.
* Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) Degree.
* 2 or more years of nursing experience working in a hospital setting.
* 1 or more years of experience working in an Oncology Pediatrics specialty area in a hospital or clinic setting.
* Experience working in a clinical research/trial participant facing role is a big plus (but this is not a requirement – resource will be trained in clinical research).
* Must be a critical thinker, prioritize, and be “appropriately assertive” and comfortable pushing back on physicians stressing the importance of accurate patient information relative to the study protocol.
* Communication Skills: The Nurse is the point person for communication with other departments. Able to communicate and articulate, translate complicated information back to a patient in a way they can understand (very important part of this job).
* Document Management Skills: comfortable editing in Microsoft Word, basic reporting in Excel, converting PDFs or Word Documents in Adobe. Comfortable with PowerPoint to provide education with other Nurses. MS Office, Teams, and SharePoint.
* Detail oriented but not to the point of stagnation.
* Must be able to thrive in a fast-paced, Academic, diverse environment.
* Must be proactive - it’s a learning environment, where Nurses are encouraged to ask questions.
* Proficient in computer applications (i.e., Microsoft Word & Excel, OnCore™ or other Clinical Trial Management Systems, medical records database systems, etc.).

**PHYSICAL DEMANDS:** Standing, sitting, walking, visual perception, talking and hearing. Lifting up to 20lbs.
  

  

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** **Vitalief partners with clients such as major medical centers and academic institutions that often requires all on-site resources such as prospective Vitalief consultants to be inoculated annually for Influenza and successfully pass a Mantoux Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) for Mycobacterium Tuberculosis.**

**CORE PROGRAM BELIEFS**


* We believe that within each of us is a desire to move towards health and achievement, under the right conditions. It is our job to provide young people with those conditions.
* We believe that every young person wants to love and be loved. It is our job to love these young people, and to help them learn to love themselves and others.
* We believe in the power of belonging. It is a core human condition to want to be missed when we are gone. We will miss young people when they are absent, and we will express that: “We didn’t see you yesterday. We missed you. We are glad you are back”. We will make sure every young person belongs in our community. No matter what. “She drew a circle to shut me out. Heretic, rebel, a thing to flout. But love and I had the wit to win. We drew a circle that took her in” (Edwin Markham)
* We accept young people for who they are. Right here. Right now. They do not have to change to be respected and loved and valued and be a member of our community. Behavior is not a condition of their worth as human beings.
* We believe that every young person wants to be in charge of their own life. To that end, we will give young people a voice in this program, and choices of how to best accomplish their goals.
* We are hungry to understand if our interventions are having the intended impact. We will be meticulous in our data entry, and ruthless in our hunt to understand the data and learn from it. If what we are doing is not working, we will set aside our egos, intentions and preconceived notions and we will change what we are doing.
* We believe that the young people with whom we work deserve our full attention and our best selves. Therefore, we will: NOT allow our personal beliefs or baggage to interfere with our work; we will commit to doing excellent work all the time on behalf of our young people; we will be honest and transparent with ourselves, our colleagues and our partners. To be very clear, by working in this program we are committing to:
	+ Engaging in self-care outside of work so that our personal issues don’t interfere with our ability to focus on our young people;
	+ Open communication - Bringing all issues directly back to the person OR to the group session in a way that fosters a healthy team;
	+ Learning our craft before practicing on our youth;
	+ Giving and receiving honest feedback, even if it is uncomfortable to hear or say

**About Us:**



Warby Parker was founded with a mission: to inspire and impact the world with vision, purpose, and style.



We're constantly asking ourselves how we can do more and make a greater impact, and that starts by reimagining everything that a company and industry can be. We want to demonstrate that a business can scale while doing good in the world, without charging a premium for it. And we've learned that it takes creativity, empathy, and innovation to achieve that goal.



Since the day we launched in 2010, we've pioneered ideas, designed products, and developed technologies that help people see. We offer everything you need for happier eyes at a price that leaves you with money in your pocket, from designer-quality glasses and contacts to eye exams and vision tests, and you can meet us online, at our stores, or even in your home. Wherever and whenever you need it, we're there to make exceptional vision care simple and accessible. (Delightful, too.)



Ultimately, we believe in vision for all, which is why for every pair of glasses or sunglasses we sell, a pair of glasses is distributed to someone in need through our Buy a Pair, Give a Pair program.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Warby-Parker","http://www.warbyparker.com","New York","501 to 1,000","","Marby Parker was founded with a rebellious spirit and a lofty objective: to offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price, while leading the way for socially conscious businesses.","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/56f2123c26a1b1e8687851d8f0ef08d2","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_headerimage/1960x400/49ea419eaf79e3492df75cdfc33ccee7","Neil Blumenthal",""

*For more information about our benefits, see below!*


We are proud to be a member of the Rentokil family of companies, the global leader in Pest Control and other services across more than 90 countries. We pride ourselves on being a trusted partner to many of the world's leading brands and serve consumer and business customers across multiple industries. We are extremely proud of our legacy of excellence and constantly work to fulfill our mission to ""protect people, enhance lives, and preserve the planet.""

**Creepy crawlies and contented customers. Intrigued?**
-------------------------------------------------------

**You might be just who we're looking for.**
--------------------------------------------


Busting bugs has its benefits. Company-provided truck, gas, and phone. Benefits including a 401(k) with a company match. Amazing earning potential. But it’s more than that. It’s serving with a smile. It’s having your teammates’ backs. It’s going above and beyond and making a difference. We step in and step up when people have problems they can’t fix, and they need the pros. We crush their pest problems and lift their spirits.


Back to you. Are you a hard worker? Can you follow direction, adapt to change, and solve problems? Are you organized, friendly, and motivated to succeed? That’s a great place to start.

**As a Pest Control Technician, here’s what you can expect**
------------------------------------------------------------

* You won’t be tied to a desk. You’ll be out and about — mobile, independent, and growing your career with a clear view of next steps. You’ll be the face of Terminix to your local community (with the backing of a national brand), and your clients will count on you to protect their businesses, their homes, and their families.
* When you first join Terminix Nation, you’ll spend a few months in training. Once you’ve got that and some state required licenses and certificates under your belt, you’ll take the lead with your own customers.
* You’ll get rewarded with competitive pay and robust benefits to cover you and your family. As a teammate, you will be eligible for a 401(k) with company match, company-paid life insurance, tuition reimbursement, and a generous student loan repayment program. You put in the work, and you’ll reap the rewards.
* You’ll be part of a community — bonus points if you’re already a leader in yours. Our bonds are strong at Terminix Nation and the relationships we develop in the communities we serve are unparalleled. Our teammates give back through volunteering, donations, scholarships, and more.
* You’ll be onboarded and trained by the best of ‘em. You’ll get paid to get licensed, something you’ll have for a lifetime. You’ll know how to bust bugs at home, too.

**What your days will look like**
---------------------------------

* Roll up your sleeves and get ready to learn how we take care of customers. You’ll become an expert in applying our company products so they’re safe and effective.
* Are you a good driver? As a technician, your office is the cab of your Terminix truck. You’ll use it on calls and take it home, too. Same goes for your Terminix phone. We trust our technicians.
* You’ll be responsible for building relationships with customers, scheduling and confirming their appointments, helping with sales to current customers, and expanding our product to new customers.
* Does technology scare you? That’s okay. We provide training and support to ensure you’re comfortable using state-of-the-art tools. You’ll also need to have strong communication skills so that you can email, text, call, talk, and write effectively. Oh, and sometimes there’s paperwork.
* There’s an opportunity to grow into a role you’re passionate about and fits your skillset — whether that’s management, a move to sales, or another opportunity at Terminix.

**Some non-negotiables**
------------------------


There are some things you’ll just need to have or know to join Terminix Nation as a Pest Control Technician.

* High school diploma or GED; or one to three months related experience and/or training; or equivalent combination of education and experience.
* Solid reading, writing, and verbal communication skills and the ability to present information in both internal and external settings.
* Some basic math skills — add, subtract, multiply, and divide in all units of measure, using whole numbers, common fractions, and decimals. You’ll need to be able to follow instructions for mixing on product labels.
* With the help of Terminix (and with the company footing the bill), you’ll need to maintain the licenses/certificates as required by federal, state, and/or local regulations. And you’ll need a valid driver’s license.

**Straight talk about the physical demands of our work**
--------------------------------------------------------


We’re not going to sugarcoat it. The essential functions of this job have some physical demands (of course, reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the essential functions.) Here’s what we mean:

* You’ve got to be able to move up to 10 lbs. regularly and 11–20 lbs. frequently, whether that’s lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, or otherwise repositioning objects.
* You’ll move around a lot — regularly sitting, climbing, balancing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, and crawling. You’ll go up and down stairs, ladders, scaffolding, ramps, and poles. And you’ll need to keep your balance when walking, standing, or crouching on narrow, slippery, or moving surfaces. (You’ll definitely get your steps in.)
* You must be able to safely operate a motor vehicle and make sure it and all other equipment is kept clean.
* The vision to perform detail-oriented activities at distances close to the eyes or within arm’s reach.
* Sometimes you’ll need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE), like an OSHA-compliant respirator, and you’ll need to be okay with regularly working in confined spaces, narrow aisles, or passageways (you know, where critters live).

**Work conditions**
-------------------


Pests don’t always live in nice places — and that’s where we do our work. But don’t worry – we’ll prepare you with all you need to do the work as safely and as comfortably as possible.

* You’ll need to be able to work both inside and outside in your local climate in company-provided weather gear.
* You’ll sometimes be working around mechanical parts, vehicles, electrical current, heights and scaffolding, fumes, dust, and chemicals, and we’ll train you how to handle all of these conditions safely.
* This is kind of a no-brainer — you’ll be around animals and insects.
* And you’ll have to be okay with working in tight, confined spaces, narrow aisles, or passageways — like you might find in crawl spaces. We work where the critters live.


To join Terminix Nation, you’ll need to meet state and federal regulations and company safety requirements.

If the ability to see and feel the impact your own work is having on the wider organization is important, this is the role for you.

The Strategic Pricing Team is in a unique position where we work cross-functionally with each Firm department and practice area, giving us an unparalleled view into Firm operations and financial performance. In addition to having oversight of pricing operations, the team is also responsible for driving the data and analytics strategy across the Firm, establishing both the “look-and-feel” of our reports and front-end user experience design.

This position will have a high degree of exposure with Firm Partners and executive committee members, while collaborating closely with the Director of Strategic Pricing and the team’s other analysts. The Strategic Pricing Analyst is uniquely positioned to utilize and develop two complementary skill sets: Legal Pricing and Reporting & Analytics. This cross-functional role will work with a wide range of Marketing and Finance professionals, and the Firm’s full spectrum of attorneys to develop new pricing arrangements, run matter and client analytics, and develop client pitches that balance competitiveness with financial performance.
