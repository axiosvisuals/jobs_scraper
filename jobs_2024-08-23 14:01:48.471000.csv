**Position Type** Non-Management  

**POSITION SUMMARY**

  



Our jobs aren’t just about giving guests a smooth check-in and check-out. Instead, we want to build and experience that is memorable and unique. Our Guest Experience Specialists take the initiative to deliver a wide range of services that guide guests through their entire stay. Their role goes beyond the traditional front desk to take ownership of the guest experience in the main areas of the hotel with a “guest first” mindset. They are empowered to move about their space and do what needs to be done. Whether processing operational needs, addressing guest requests, completing reports, delivering quality meals, or sharing the highlights of the local area, the Guest Experience Specialist makes transactions feel like part of the experience.

  



No matter what position you are in, there are a few things that are critical to success – creating a safe work place, following company policies and procedures, maintaining confidentiality, protecting company assets, upholding quality standards, and ensuring your uniform, personal appearance, and communications are professional. Guest Experience Specialists will be on their feet and moving around (stand, sit, or walk for an extended time) and taking a hands-on approach to work (move, lift, carry, push, pull, and place objects weighing less than or equal to 25 pounds without assistance; reach overhead and below the knees, including bending, twisting, pulling, and stooping). Doing all these things well (and other reasonable job duties as requested) is critical for Guest Experience Specialists – to get it right for our guests and our business each and every time.

  



PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS


Education: High school diploma or G.E.D. equivalent.


Related Work Experience: No related work experience.


Supervisory Experience: No supervisory experience.


License or Certification: None

For more than 60 years Parfums Givenchy has perpetuated the values of its founder, Hubert de Givenchy, releasing fragrances, makeup and skincare products that define free, assertive and bold women.


Parfums Givenchy fragrances embody the brand’s Fearless Classic vision, fusing genres and revealing unexpected twists. Inspired by the avant-garde spirit and sensuality of Givenchy Couture creations, Nicolas Degennes, Makeup and Color Artistic Director since 1999, continues to reveal the inventiveness synonymous with Givenchy.


In 1970, Kenzo Takada instilled a touch of jungle exoticism at the heart of Paris, in Galerie Vivienne. With his colorful prints and his self-professed creative freedom, Kenzo upturned the couture diktats of the time by merrily breaking the rules. In keeping with this cheerful and colorful heritage, Carol Lim and Humberto Leon took over the artistic direction of the House of Kenzo in 2011.


The brand’s first feminine fragrance, called Kenzo, was born in 1988. Then followed a series of creations with a unique and original identity that made a strong impression on the world of perfumery. They all tell an optimistic story and play with a mix of multicultural codes to savor again and again. The bottles themselves are symbols of pure refinement and emblems of the brand’s values.

We believe in strong authentic relationships between teachers and students, supported by effective school systems and an engaging instructional model that enables students to flourish academically and personally. North Star Academy is NJ's #1 highest performing public charter school and has served Newark families for over 20 years.

 **Job Description**  

As a nation, we have long struggled to provide equitable access to a high-quality education for all students, and the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic only served to exacerbate those systemic inequities. At the same time, the disruption and innovation of the last two years have opened the door to a new sense of possibility. Many students, school staff and system leaders have rightly called to use this moment not just to recover – but to reimagine and reinvent how we approach education.


High School students have been amongst the most vocal about what they want – more agency and flexibility, more high-interest and high-quality course choices, greater attention to their needs as whole children, and more intentionality about launching them successfully toward a diverse array of college and career options. Based on these themes, many system leaders have begun to craft an ambitious agenda to reinvent high school. Because of this need, North Star is partnering with Stepmojo to offer all students radically expanded access to high-interest, rigorous courses, exceptional teachers, and personalized college and career options. In order to deliver on this extraordinary opportunity, we need a team of on-the-ground coaches to support student learning.


The presence of technology alone is no guarantee that students will succeed. Strong, effective online learning doesn’t just happen. It requires the work of thoughtful, engaged staff who leverage the best of remote instruction and in-person scaffolds to address the unique learning needs of their students. Learning coaches will give an extra boost to the online learning experience. They will build affirming relationships with students, manage all in-person activities by circulating and encouraging students, entering attendance data daily and grade data weekly.

**Responsibilities:**

* **Manage the Classroom/Workspace Environment**
	+ Arrange and maintain a safe, structured, and effective learning environment
	+ Create a positive, achievement-oriented learning environment that excites and invests students (e.g., establish classroom routines and expectations, develop affirming relationships with students)
	+ Encourage students to engage and be active participants in their online course
	+ Troubleshoot minor technical issues (e.g., forgotten headphones, lost chargers)
* **Provide In-person Support for Students**
	+ Track and monitor student attendance – intervening if truancy occurs
	+ Notify school-site coordinator if attendance issues persist
	+ Serve as a thought partner to work through issues during independent work time
	+ Provide in the moment feedback to students regarding their participation in class – affirming and engaging students in the learning
	+ Connect students who are struggling behaviorally or academically with the appropriate StepMojo or North Star resources
	+ Conference with students’ family and academic advisor keeping everyone informed of the learning
	+ Serve as a mentor to students – establishing trusting relationships and providing active guidance throughout the course
* **Communication with the Online Instructor**
	+ Establish asynchronous check-in routines and procedures with each course instructor
	+ Share insights as to how students are engaging with the content (e.g., where they struggle, high points of interest, questions)
* **Provide Feedback to StepMojo and North Star**
	+ Meet with the implementation team for an initial orientation and onboarding session
	+ Collaborate with StepMojo and North Star staff to improve the pilot implementation
	+ Participate in periodic feedback sessions and ongoing trainin
* **General Responsibilities**
	+ Assist teachers with instruction, assessments, grading, and other classroom responsibilities;
	+ Potentially teach small groups of students;
	+ Support students by providing one-on-one and small group tutoring daily, and small group intervention and student support;
	+ Observe Master Teachers in order to improve instructional techniques and classroom management;
	+ Provide administrative support including but not limited to copies, hallway duty, organizing classroom materials, etc.
	+ As appropriate, perform all duties expected of staff, including but not limited to:
		- Participating in grade-level activities, and school-wide functions, events, and trips;
		- Providing consistent rewards and/or consequences for student behavior;
		- Serving as an advisor to a small group of students;
		- Supervising students during transitions, breakfast, lunch and afterschool;
		- Communicating effectively with students, families, and colleagues;
		- Participating in an annual three-week staff orientation and training.
