A position is available for a postdoctoral researcher with a strong background in cancer biology and immunology. This postdoctoral fellow will work under the direction of Dr. Gholami, an Associate Professor and surgeon-scientist at Northwell Health and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, within the laboratory of Dr. Westcott. The Gholami laboratory research is centered on understanding the host-immune cell interactions and the mechanisms by which the immune system and tumor microenvironment play a role in the biology and anti-tumor response of liver metastases. More specifically, the laboratory research focuses on mechanisms of immune resistance in liver metastases to develop novel immune augmenting therapies and practice-changing clinical trials.

Our group studies the interaction of the immune system and CRC, specifically in the context of liver metastases. CRC remains the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States, with the liver being the most common site of metastases. However, the liver constitutes an immunosuppressive microenvironment which is poorly understood. Communications between the different components of the tumor microenvironment influence tumor growth, its response to therapy, and its ability to metastasize. The Gholami laboratory investigates the importance of various immune cells using mouse models of CRC developed by Dr. Westcott (Nature Cancer, 2021) and clinical specimens, incorporating cutting-edge techniques in multiomics and spatial biology. These techniques allow us to observe the behaviors and interactions between cancer cells and immune cells at a single cell resolution. Our ultimate goal is to develop and test new immunotherapy treatment strategies, characterize interactions between tumor and immune microenvironment, and elucidate mechanisms of response/resistance to therapies.

Dr. Gholami has a vested interest in clinical trials and serve as the co-Chair of the Colon subcommittee for SWOG, a member of the NCI Colon Cancer Task Force and ASCO Guideline Expert Panel. We are looking for candidates interested in developing their own research question in alignment with the goals of the research laboratory. The selected candidate will be provided significant resources, including access to state-of-the-art laboratory space and the opportunity to discuss science in a multi-disciplinary and diverse atmosphere. Opportunities to learn about model systems of disease, advanced microscopy and sequencing, translational science, and clinical trials will be provided.

**Position Requirements**

Education: The applicant is expected to be in the process of completing or have recently completed a PhD degree with research experience in cancer biology and/or immunology.

Experience/Skills: The candidate must have a deep understanding of the requirement to test hypotheses experimentally to advance science. A track record of peer reviewed lead authorship publications is expected. Familiarity with animal and in vitro cancer biology models as well immunology is expected. completed a PhD degree with research experience in cancer biology and/or immunology.
