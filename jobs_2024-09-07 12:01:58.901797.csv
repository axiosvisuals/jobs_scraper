If you're a recent graduate or soon-to-be graduate, join us and unlock a world of carefully curated experiences, knowledge, and connections to shape your career. Along the way, you can expect all the training and support you need to make your mark on the world. Put simply, we’ll empower you to help determine how we do things and where we go next.

 **Why the Cyber and Security Graduate program?**

  

Join our Cyber Security team within the Chief Security Office, and you’ll have the opportunity to play a key part in keeping our customers, clients, and colleagues safe from cyber-crime. This is a team in which everyone is focused on defending the bank: some are proactive, researching potential threats from hackers, while others play a reactive role in which they respond to incidents that might challenge our security. To gain maximum benefit from your graduate program, you’ll experience many aspects of our work over a two-year period. You can expect three rotations around a variety of teams which might include Cyber & Physical Security, Resilience, Crisis Management, Security Operations and Intelligence, and more. This is an exciting place to be: hackers constantly attempt to find new ways to threaten our security, and we never rest in learning new ways to prevent them. We’re one of the strongest banks for Cyber Security, and this is your opportunity to learn from the best.

 **Cyber and Security at Barclays**

  

The Chief Security Office’s ongoing mission is to keep the bank and our customers, clients, and colleagues safe, secure, and always on.

  

Every day presents new challenges. These range from cyber security, terrorism, viruses, world events, fraudsters, and even upheaval in the external economic climate. We partner with teams across the bank to minimize disruption to our services from threats such as these, and to make sure that any services affected by disruption can bounce back quickly.


As the world around us changes, we are prepared and ready to respond.


This makes our work endlessly interesting, meaningful, and challenging.

 **To be considered for this program, you must:**

  

Be an undergraduate or masters student with an anticipated graduation date between December 2024 - June 2025 and a GPA of 3.2 or above.

 **Ideally, you would also have:**

  

An interest in working in technology, the ability to act as a bridge between the business and technology teams, and a passion to deliver the next technological breakthrough.

 **Working in Whippany**

  

Our next-generation workplace in Whippany allows talented, passionate, down-to-earth colleagues to connect daily. With state-of-the-art work facilities and many added features like pool tables, cafés, and a gym – it’s a place you can call home.


But we recognize there’s life outside work.

We’re also dedicated to the wider community; our Citizenship program is focused around how we play our part in overcoming the challenges that face our societies.


Our location means there’s plenty to enjoy off campus – our office is minutes away from Morristown, known for its rich history and lively modern spirit. With bustling Manhattan easily accessible and a picturesque landscape here on the doorstep, Whippany really does offer the best of both worlds.
