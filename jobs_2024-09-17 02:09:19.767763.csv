**About Us:**



Competitive triathletes and passionate bakers, Pam Weekes and Connie McDonald left their careers to open a small bread shop in New York City in 1995 — Levain Bakery.  

One day, they baked a BIG chocolate chip walnut cookie as energy for triathlon training. At Levain, a batch of these 6-ounce cookies flew off the shelves, and an icon was born. The cozy shop on West 74th Street became a neighborhood favorite and a destination for epicurious visitors from around the world, hungry for “the cookie.”  


From the start, Pam, Connie and team baked everything fresh on-site each day, donating the day’s leftovers to charity — and we still do, nearly 30 years later. Today, Levain has bakeries across the country (with more to come!), plus ecommerce gift boxes to treat cookie lovers in every state.  


Every day, we strive to embody our company’s five core values:
* Welcome All- *we are all in it together*
* Work Hard and Be Nice- *we go above and beyond*
* Lead with Heart- *we do the right thing*
* Rise Up- *we are proactive*
* Savor It- *we are present and find the fun!*","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Levain-Bakery","http://www.levainbakery.com","New York","2 to 10","less than $1M (USD)","","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/1497c6aa21dc80b7a30bd7185f92e8ca","","",""

BALDOR HISTORY:



When Louis Balducci rented a pushcart for $5.00 a week in 1918, little did he know that he was laying the foundations for Baldor Specialty Foods. In 1946, Louis opened a fruit stand called Balducci’s Produce in Greenwich Village that flourished into a beloved specialty food shop. Food writer James Beard was a regular customer and noted that Balducci’s always sold “the best of the best, at the right price.”



A family business from the start, the company employed numerous family members including son-in-law, Kevin Murphy. Murphy ran Balducci’s wholesale division, Baldor, so passionately that the Balducci family encouraged him to establish the business as an independent entity in 1991. Over the next decade, Baldor sustained continuous growth while maintaining the standard of excellence that made Balducci’s a success. The company cemented its reputation for sourcing expertise after introducing blanched frisee to the American market. Murphy named it “Circus Frisee” after famed restaurant Le Cirque.



Today, Baldor is the leading importer and distributor of fresh produce and specialty foods in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. The company is headed by Kevin’s son, T.J. Murphy, C.E.O. Under his leadership, Baldor remains committed to customer service, quality and innovation.



Baldor Specialty Foods has a long legacy of quality, consistency and service. Under the leadership of the former Owner and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Murphy, President Mike Muzyk joined Baldor in 1996 and today works closely with Kevin’s son, TJ Murphy, who has been the Owner and Chief Executive Office since 2013. Under the leadership and partnership of TJ and Mike, in the last seven years, Baldor has achieved consistent double-digit growth in addition to geographic, category, product and channel expansion.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Baldor-Specialty-Foods","http://www.baldorfood.com/","155 Food Center Drive Bronx, NY 10474","1,001 to 5,000","$100M to $500M (USD)","","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/e3b9819e55268c9e7c73e5714df9a2f2","","",""

StaffCo is a Professional Employer Organization, commonly referred to as a PEO, duly organized and registered under the New York Professional Employer Organization law. StaffCo and SUNY have entered into a professional employer agreement under which StaffCo is the employer of Stony Brook Clinical Practice Management Plan employees and responsible for all aspects of employment, including hirings, promotions, disciplines, terminations, the day-to-day direction and supervision of work, as well as labor relations and collective bargaining. StaffCo is fully responsible for providing all payroll and human resources services, including the payment of wages, collecting and reporting payroll taxes and maintaining any and all employee benefits. SUNY Stony Brook Hospital is responsible for the operation of the hospital and provision of health care and is the co-employer as is necessary to conduct its responsibilities and for related licensure, regulatory or statutory requirements and obligations.

  

Given StaffCo’s employment responsibilities, it is deemed the “employer” for employment and labor law purposes. Thus, the employees are private sector employees of StaffCo, not public sector employees of SUNY. The private sector nature of the StaffCo employees has been approved by NYS Civil Service and upheld in a decision by the US National Labor Relations Board.

* ***Are you ready to control your financial future with unlimited upside earnings potential?***
* ***Are you looking for continuous learning and the opportunity to invest in yourself?***
* ***Do you want to join a dynamic, inclusive team environment with a culture of collaboration and belonging?***

If so, this may be the opportunity for you. Don't just take our word for it... read on and see for yourself!

  

In this role, you will sell ADP's Retirement Services 401(k) solutions. With a little help from our top-notch sales training, you'll connect with both new and existing clients to sell products that put millions of employees on the road to retirement readiness.


If you prefer doing things the same all the time - rinse and repeat - then you may not be a perfect fit for this role. In selling Retirement Solutions, you will find that every sales process is different. You won't sell one product with a standardized price list to the same type of buyer again and again. However, if it excites you to think that each sales process, each client/prospect interaction, and each day will be different, then you'll reap the rewards with industry-leading compensation, benefits, luxurious incentive trips, and awards as you make a name for yourself at ADP. (Hey, you love learning new things and ""patience"" is your middle name.) As you strive to grow your career, leaders will back your desire to pursue advancement and provide continual sales training.


**A little about ADP:** We are a global leader in human resources technology, offering the latest AI and machine learning-enhanced payroll, tax, human resources, benefits, and much more. We believe our people make all the difference in cultivating an inclusive, down-to-earth culture that welcomes ideas, encourages innovation, and values belonging. We've received recognition as a global Best Places to Work and a recipient of many prestigious awards for diversity, equity, and inclusion, including a DiversityInc® Top 50 Company, Best CEO and company for women, LGBTQ+, multicultural talent, and more.
