Lev is transforming the $600B commercial real estate financing space. We have built a digital marketplace that uses AI to match borrowers with the best-fit lenders for their deals.

Sounds like the sort of the thing that should already exist, right? Well, it doesn’t.

We are the first people to be tackling this problem at scale. That’s why top-tier VCs and a who’s who of financial companies have invested more than $100M to help us grab this massive opportunity.

**Who we’re looking for**

We are on the hunt for a top-performing SDR who is ready to take the next step in their career by managing a full-funnel sales process. If you are constantly beating your quota as an SDR and getting frustrated by the lack of career progression opportunities at your current company, then we should chat.

In this role, you will initially run SDR-style motions using our established playbook (and some of the secret sauce that makes you a top performer in your current role). While you are running those motions we’ll put you on a crash course to get a deep understanding of our platform, who we sell it to and how we sell it.

Once you’ve proven you’ve got the pitch and closing process down, we’ll transition you into a full-funnel role with quota and commission to match. For the right candidate this transition from Senior SDR to Associate AE should take 3-4 months.

Here’s what the Associate AE Role will look like:

**Prospecting and lead generation:** Our top performing AEs still manage their own lead generation and you’ll be no exception. However, once you move into your closing role your lead gen work will be supplemented with leads provided by marketing and your replacement in the SDR seat.

**Running discovery meetings and product demos:** You’ll run meetings to understand prospects’ pain points and then you’ll deliver compelling demos that demonstrate how our platform will directly address those pain points. You’ll then help onboard customers and get them setup with their proof of concept (POC) financing deal.

**POC management and contract negotiation:** You’ll work alongside our Account Management team to ensure that your prospects have a mind-blowing experience during their POC and then you’ll parachute in as the POC ends to finalize their annual agreement.

**Renewals and upsells:** We have opportunities for upselling customers during the term of their agreements. Your job will be to monitor for potential upsell signals then work with customers to upgrade their contracts. You’ll also manage annual renewals for your book of business.

**The must haves**

* 1-2 years of experience as a high-performing SDR at a software startup; we’re going to want you to wow us with the innovative tactics you’ve used and the results you’ve achieved
* Confidence to run sales processes with senior-level contacts, but also a humbleness and passion to constantly be learning and improving your craft
* An inquisitive and collaborative approach that will allow you to understand prospect pain points and tailor your pitches accordingly
* A scrappy, can-do attitude and a flexibility to adapt to the constant twists and turns that characterize startup life
* Fluency with the tools you’ll need to run your job effectively (CRM, prospecting tools, cadencing tools, data enrichment tools etc).
* Knowledge of commercial real estate a major plus; interest in commercial real estate a must!

**The nitty gritty**

* This is an office-based role in NYC (4 days in office)

At Preferred Home Health Care & Nursing Services, a Care Options for Kids company, we provide 1:1 care in the home, and we do things a little differently. There's no revolving door of patients or hospital setting chaos — blinking call lights, scurrying doctors, and wards bursting at the seams.


Instead, you work with self-sufficient autonomy, empowered to make a real difference in your clients' lives. We value your clinical knowledge and respect the deep one-on-one bond you establish with the families you care for. Of course, if you need anything, your Director of Nursing is only a phone call away — we offer 24-hour, 365-day support and on-demand clinical resources.

**A Day in the Life of a Care Options for Kids Nurse**


You start your day by touching base with your care team, whether that's mom, dad, or the nurse you are relieving. For added ease, in-depth information on your client is available in our dedicated EHR platform.


Your client greets you warmly. Though she's non-verbal, she'll smile and reach out to touch your face and put her head to your chest for a cuddle — she's excited to see you. After disconnecting her ventilator, which she only needs at night, it's time for breakfast and a light sponge bath.


From there, every day is a new adventure. You may decide to head outdoors to gaze at clouds, hunt for ladybugs, or make flower crowns. You may set up a living room campout or travel back in time with a book until it's time for lunch.


Throughout the day, you prepare and deliver her medications and perform her routine trach and g-tube care — documenting the dosages and treatments within your dedicated Point of Care platform, where you're able to view and compare notes and assessments easily and electronically. While your client takes a late afternoon nap, you finalize your electronic documentation and touch base with the relieving member of your care team before heading home.


Whatever the day brings, a day in the life of a Care Options for Kids nurse feels less like work and more like caring for family. It's an opportunity to build your clinical expertise while shaping the lives of your client and their loved ones every single day.

New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation

**Outposted Therapeutic Housing Units Program (OTxHU)**


Since 2016, Correctional Health Services (CHS) has been the direct provider of health care in the New York City jails. Deeply committed to human dignity and patient rights, CHS is part of the NYC Health + Hospitals system and is a key partner in the City’s efforts to reform the criminal-legal system. Our in-jail clinical services include medical, nursing, and mental health care; pharmacy services; substance-use treatment; social work; dental and vision care; discharge planning; and reentry support.


Given the high visibility of this initiative, we are seeking the highest caliber health care professionals in key clinical services to staff our Outposted Therapeutic Housing Units (OTxHU). To be located in three NYC Health + Hospital acute care facilities, the OTxHU is a pioneering approach to safely increasing access to high quality clinical care for patients in custody who have complicated health conditions. OTxHUs will bridge the gap in the continuum between care provided in the jails and inpatient hospitalization, with admission to and discharge from the OTxHU in accordance with a patient’s clinical needs. CHS will be the primary health care providers on these units and the NYC Department of Correction will provide security and custody management.


The OTxHU at NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue in Manhattan will be the first of this unique, groundbreaking project to open with a planned completion date as early as the end of 2024. This is an incredible opportunity to be part of a passionate and motivated team providing care to some of the City’s most marginalized, vulnerable people.

* To help support continuity of operations and care, staff selected to work in the OTxHU may also be required to work in CHS locations within the jails. Additionally, while CHS seeks the most qualified individuals for these positions, preference will be given to equally qualified, internal candidates.

Mobile IV Medics is proudly physician owned and operated, following protocols set forth by our medical director in order to provide the absolute best and safest care to our patients. Our team creates **positive change** in the lives of others by helping people feel better in the comfort of their own home. Our nurses provide relief to those suffering from cold/flu-like symptoms, nausea and vomiting, migraines, fatigue, hangovers, and so much more. If making a meaningful impact by helping others is your career goal, we’d love to talk with you!

Being that this position is completely mobile, the ideal candidate will enjoy traveling to client locations, possess expert IV skills, keen assessment skills, excellent bedside manner, and have a zealous drive to get out there and treat as many patients as possible while making great money in the process! Nurses will function as independent contractors (1099/W9) and make a percentage of each call they complete plus tips (we are a concierge service, so we accept tips!). Although you are functioning as an independent contractor, this is not like a travel or temporary assignment, we want our amazing nurses to stay for the long-run!

We are looking for nurses available a minimum of 2-3 days per week. During your ""on call days"" you are simply made available. The patient selects their service online from our menu of fluids, vitamins, and add-ins but of course once you arrive to the patient, treatment is always customizable based off their needs. You will be provided with training and resources in order to provide the absolute best care for our patients using our protocols established by our Medical Director.

Being a 1099 independent contractor, supplies are your financial responsibility, however, this provides you with tax write-offs, other self-employment benefits, and great pay! We will set you up directly with our contracted medical vendors where you will receive the best pricing in the industry for supplies. Not only does this role provide lucrative pay but it provides the ability for autonomy and freedom to have a great work-life balance!

Dr. Lingbo Zhang’s Laboratory at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) is part of a $75 million Center for Therapeutics Research at CSHL. There are multiple fully funded postdoctoral fellowships available in the Zhang Laboratory to investigate roles of nervous system activities and micronutrients in regulating hematologic cancers and to develop novel therapeutic strategies for these diseases.

The Zhang Laboratory utilizes CRISPR functional genomics to systematically uncover critical genetic effectors and their related metabolites that modulate hematologic cancers. The ultimate goal is to understand how environmental signals such as nervous system activities and micronutrients modulate hematopoietic cell development and hematologic cancers. Based on these basic mechanistic insights, the Laboratory is building innovative therapeutics to treat hematopoietic cancers that are currently without effective therapeutic options.

Blend Smoothie & Salad Bar is now hiring in a few locations. If you're outgoing, have food experience, excellent customer service and love health we would love to meet with you.


Crew members take care of the end-to-end ordering process, from asking customers about their orders to processing payment and preparing the requested food. For faster turnaround times, it’s common for crew members to work together as a team for each customer transaction and divide tasks among themselves. Task rotation happens regularly, so crew members experience several workstations, such as the front counter and kitchen. Compliance is a major aspect of the job, as they must ensure the cleanliness of the entire store and follow safety requirements and official procedures. Most crew members work part time, staying on their feet for long periods. Shifts depend on Blend Smoothie and Salad Bar’s opening hours, with overtime likely during lunch or other crowded periods.

**Process Orders**- The crew member is responsible for taking customer orders according to company guidelines. This involves requesting and verifying customers’ chosen food items, then operating cash registers to process payment. Crew members may also promote other Blend Smoothie and Salad Bar products using suggestive selling techniques.

**Prepare Food**- Because customers expect only a short waiting time, crew members must prepare and package food quickly without compromising quality, usually by complying with Blend Smoothie and Salad Bar’s recipes and procedures. They must also observe safety requirements and consider factors such as presentation, portion control, and special requests.

**Assist Customers-** During their entire shift, crew members strive to provide a high level of service. They greet customers warmly, answer basic inquiries about Blend Smoothie and Salad Bar and offer information about menu items, creating a comfortable environment through their courteous, respectful attitude.

**Maintain Blend Smoothie and Salad Bar Cleanliness**- Crew members keep their workstations clean and organized to satisfy company standards and ensure hygienic food preparation. Beyond this, some employers assign more general housekeeping duties to crew members, who may also inspect and maintain other parts of Blend Smoothie and Salad Bar, such as the kitchen, restrooms, or parking lot.

**Identify Problems**- Since crew members interact firsthand with customers, they’re in a prime position to look out for possible issues, such as excessively lengthy lines or inconvenient packaging and customers often turn to them when voicing their complaints. Crew members must know how to handle such situations and promptly relay these concerns to management.


Crew members are efficient and adaptable, catering to customers in record time and accomplishing their tasks calmly even during busy periods. They excel at following procedures and keeping track of details. In addition, crew members benefit from having the following skills:

**Customer Service** – crew members must be prepared for various scenarios, from routine order-taking to complaint resolution. To address inquiries properly, they should also be knowledgeable about menu items and Blend Smoothie and Salad Bar as a whole

**Accuracy** – crew members are attentive and thorough, double-checking orders and strictly abiding by instructions when preparing food. It’s essential to get every detail right, especially since they serve a queue of customers and mistakes may result in undesirable delays

**Teamwork** – working within a team is typical for crew members. They must communicate clearly and synchronize their workflow with others if they are to accomplish customer requests in a span of minutes

**Multitasking** – job duties for crew members are diverse. Given their fast-paced work environment, they should be excellent multitaskers who can switch fluidly between different kinds of activities and cope with high demand

**Physical dexterity** – crew members use their hands significantly, as their food preparation duties may entail cooking, cutting, and wrapping. Another physical requirement is standing for several hours

**Must** be able to **lift 50 pounds** or more.

**Do you bring out the star in your students?**
Our motto here at Taylor Robinson Music is ""Learn to Play From the Heart"", and we are looking for private music instructors who share the same philosophy! We strive to make music lessons as accessible and affordable to as many people as possible because we believe the importance of music education is essential to making the world a better, happier place!


Taylor Robinson Music is hiring private music instructors, especially for Voice. We do not have a brick-and-mortar studio location in the Farmingdale, NJ area, but we have students needing teachers ASAP!


Lessons can occur in the students' homes; in your own home or your own studio/rehearsal space; or via webcam. Please note that while we do get requests for webcam, they make up only a small percentage of our student base. Most of our students still prefer in-person lessons, so we need local instructors who can host students and/or are willing to travel to students in the Farmingdale, NJ area.


You would be paid on an independent contractor basis between $20-$30 per hour dependent on travel time, your experience/education, and your student retention rate. You have the freedom to set your own schedule, as well as your own curriculum/lesson plans! Also, we take care of all the advertising, marketing, and SEO work for you to bring the students in and handle all the billing to help lighten your load so you can focus on what's most important - the music!


If you are great with kids, love teaching, keep in good communication with our office, and are organized and on time for all lessons, Taylor Robinson Music might be the place. Formal music training is not mandatory but EITHER a degree in music, enrollment in a music program, professional performing experience, or previous teaching experience is a must.


If you have one of the above and are interested in learning more, please apply using the link below:

Are you taking any additional COVID-19 precautions?


Though some students are okay to take lessons via webcam, most students are hoping to go to their instructor's studio or have their instructor come to their home. You must wear a mask, sanitize your hands, & practice social distancing when applicable.

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/U--haul","http://www.uhaul.com/","2727 North Central Avenue
