Company Profile  

  

Morgan Stanley is a leading global financial services firm providing a wide range of investment banking, securities, investment management and wealth management services. The Firm's 75,000 employees, located in 1,200 offices across 41 countries, serve clients including corporations, governments, and individuals.

Morgan Stanley provides a superior foundation for building a professional career - a place for people to learn, achieve and grow. A philosophy that balances personal lifestyles, perspectives and needs is an important part of our culture.#  



Team Culture  

  

Fusion Response operates with a bias for action to mitigate business disruption, maintaining situational awareness of risks, and staying focused on its clients while remaining accountable for its actions and outcomes. The team exhibits strong command and control, while centralizing timely and accurate communications and guidance to key clients during the life cycle of an incident.
  

Fusion Response operates with an intent-based leadership philosophy. By providing intent and context behind actions as opposed to direction and instructions, leaders are more effectively able to cascade down decision-making power to the subject matter experts and other members of the team. This allows leaders and managers to focus on leading, coaching and driving strategy.  

To implement this philosophy, a successful candidate is expected to prioritize fostering a learning culture, understanding roles and responsibilities, understanding context behind our mission and actions, learning from past mistakes, and being coachable and empowered.  

Psychological safety is of the upmost importance within Fusion Response, including the practices of Inclusion, shifting attitudes towards risk and failure, having a willingness to help, and maintain open dialog.

  



Division Profile  

  

Fusion Response leads rapid and comprehensive Response and Recovery operations in order to minimize impact from a broad range of potentially business disrupting, to significantly impacting, threats and incidents, from cyber and fraud to technology incidents, weather events, terror attacks, geopolitical unrest & pandemics, collaborating with partner organizations to Understand, Prepare, and Learn from these events.

  

Fusion's 24/7 proactive follow-the-sun model is the cornerstone of the Firm's operational response and resilience capability with locations in New York, Alpharetta, London, Glasgow, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Singapore.  

  

Team Profile  

  

The Enterprise Command Center (ECC) is a high-performing globally distributed team that plays a mission critical role in Incident Management, Problem Management, Change Management, seated in the state-of-the-art Fusion Center. The ECC creates value by providing command, control and communication for significant Firm-wide technology incidents, in addition to providing cross-response capability for cyber security incidents and supporting the invocation of business continuity plans. The ECC drives adoption of best practices through our focus on stability and improving operational transparency across the organization.  

  

Role Profile  

  

The Firm believes in a culture of learning and collaboration, and therefore maintains a majority of the week in the office.

  

The role is an opportunity to manage major and severe business impacting incidents, primarily involving large scale infrastructure issues, by leading calls with up to 100+ people, actively managing risk and coordinating real-time service restoration.

  

As a member of our pro-active, pragmatic, and energetic team, you are in the unique position to interact with people and teams globally, across all levels of the Firm, and influence decisions that have a direct impact on operational stability.

  

A typical day would be to provide team coverage from 08:00 to 19:00 ET on a nine-hour shift basis, and periodic on call coverage during bank holidays and weekends on a rotational basis, typically once every 10-12 weeks, depending on team staffing. You would collaborate with the rest of the team to manage calls that focus around assessing business impact and / or technical remediation, ensuring that all participating teams are focused on impact remediation and providing timely incident communications to relevant stakeholders. The position requires thinking on one's feet during high pressure situations, organizational and situational awareness, sound judgement and a strong analytical ability.

  

The role will also involve advising and consulting on processes related to Incident Management, Problem Management and Change Management, as well as the delivery of other ITSM services. Following any significant incidents, team members will undertake post incident reviews, and follow up with the necessary stakeholders to review lessons learned and drive change that will bring additional stability to the Firm.

**Are you a Medical Receptionist who is looking to advance your professional career with a part-time position without being inundated with data entry, working weekends, taking your work home to complete, or working long hours just to get by?**  

Well, then we may have the right position for you.  

Hi, I am Negin Jalayer,owner, of Marathon Physical Therapy. I hope you are okay with me telling you a little about our backstory.  

  

After graduating PT school... I worked in a few different settings, including outpatient, then an orthopedic group that was forced to sell their PT division to a major national healthcare corporation where I managed a PT setting throughout my early career...  

The focus was on the following:  

Total number of **Evals...**
  

Total Number Of **Visits.**..  

**Productivity**...  

**Finalize Notes...**  

**metrics... Metrics... METRICS!**  

You get the idea.  

I remember the nights **coming home late**, and **being so frustrated.**
  

Don't get me wrong I learned a ton, but I wanted to **""Be Different""**
  

**Just like you...**  

So, I quit my corporate job and started my own private PT practice where I treated patients 1-to-1 vs 1-to-many.  

A couple of **patients started to trickle in**...  

Then a couple of patients started to get **better...QUICKER**.  

**The interesting part was**...  

I was performing the **same therapy techniques**...  

I was performing the **same exercises**...  

But patients were **getting better... quicker... like 3-5x quicker**.  

It was because the amount of **ATTENTION** I was able **to give each patient** changed drastically.  

Hopefully, **that's not too cliché.**
  

Over the past couple of years we have been able to **help 1000s of local residents!**
  

The **key ""metrics"" we pride ourselves on are not volume**, the number of new patients, or gross revenue.... **but our customer satisfaction and staff retention rates.**
  

Most of our staff has been with us for 3+ years after hire, and the ones that do leave typically are the ones who move out of the area.  

And for that, we are blessed to have such a **great team here at Marathon Physical Therapy.**
  

We are looking for an **individual who can**...  

  

* **Schedule New Patient Evaluations**
* **Check In New Patients** and Collect Pertinent Paperwork
* **Greet All Patients** Like They Are VIPs!
* **Check-In / Out** all Existing Patients
* **Insurance Benefits Check** and **Authorizations**
* **Collect Patient Payments**
* **Schedule Patients** Appointments Appropriately
* **Have A Lot Of Fun While Making A Difference In Someone's Life!**

**If this sounds like something that you might be interested in, simply apply and I will be in touch to set up a time to chat.**  

I look forward to hearing from you,

**Outposted Therapeutic Housing Units Program (OTxHU)**


Since 2016, Correctional Health Services (CHS) has been the direct provider of health care in the New York City jails. Deeply committed to human dignity and patient rights, CHS is part of the NYC Health + Hospitals system and is a key partner in the City’s efforts to reform the criminal-legal system. Our in-jail clinical services include medical, nursing, and mental health care; pharmacy services; substance-use treatment; social work; dental and vision care; discharge planning; and reentry support.
Given the high visibility of this initiative, we are seeking the highest caliber health care professionals in key clinical services to staff our Outposted Therapeutic Housing Units (OTxHU). To be located in three NYC Health + Hospital acute care facilities, the OTxHU is a pioneering approach to safely increasing access to high quality clinical care for patients in custody who have complicated health conditions. OTxHUs will bridge the gap in the continuum between care provided in the jails and inpatient hospitalization, with admission to and discharge from the OTxHU in accordance with a patient’s clinical needs. CHS will be the primary health care providers on these units and the NYC Department of Correction will provide security and custody management.
The OTxHU at NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue in Manhattan will be the first of this unique, groundbreaking project to open with a planned completion date as early as the end of 2024. This is an incredible opportunity to be part of a passionate and motivated team providing care to some of the City’s most marginalized, vulnerable people.* To help support continuity of operations and care, staff selected to work in the OTxHU may also be required to work in CHS locations within the jails. Additionally, while CHS seeks the most qualified individuals for these positions, preference will be given to equally qualified, internal candidates.

**Who We Are**



East Harlem Scholars Academies are community-based Pre-K to 12 public charter schools operated by East Harlem Tutorial Program (EHTP). EHTP began in 1958 as a children's reading group and has since grown into a multi-site after-school program for traditional public school students and a network of public charter schools focused on significantly increasing the college graduation rate in East Harlem. We are on track to serve at least 25% of East Harlem students by 2025, with enrollment for this year at approximately 2200 students in our schools and after school programs. In 2020, 99% of our seniors were accepted to college, and our current scholars in college are on-track to graduate at eight times the national average of their peers.



At EHTP we also aim to serve as an agent of change and thoughtfully contribute to the national fight for racial equity. Through our organization-wide commitment to anti-racism work, we prepare our scholars to effect change, challenge the status quo, and thrive in the world around them. As staff members, we face our own racial identities and conscious and unconscious biases. With this in mind, all of our professional development, curriculum, organizational materials, and processes are designed with a goal of racial justice. Read our racial equity statement **here**.



We ground all of our work in racial equity, **in our core values**, and in our four guiding pursuits: the Revolutionary Pursuit of Love, the Radical Pursuit of Knowledge, the Responsive Pursuit of Healing, and in the Relentless Pursuit of Results. These pursuits inform and are reflected in our current four key strategic priorities: to increase high-impact, high-quality academic curriculum, programming content, staff capacity, and coaching; to embrace and advance our use of technology; to deepen our embodiment of ethical and equitable radical humanity; and to efficiently operationalize teaching, learning, community, and care.

Harry's Inc. is building a modern CPG company by putting people first and delivering against real unmet consumer needs.  

  

The company's flagship brand - Harry's - was founded by Jeff Raider and Andy Katz-Mayfield in 2013. After successfully launching and scaling Harry's, Jeff and Andy saw an opportunity to bring their experience building Harry's to other CPG categories where the consumer has also been historically underserved.  

  

Harry's Inc. has grown significantly over the last ten years, and is now made up of four brands - Harry's, Flamingo, Lume, Mando - and Harry's Labs, the company's incubation and M&A engine. The company employs more than 900 people across the U.S., U.K. and Germany, and is the largest CPG company built in the last 20 years.  

  

At Harry's Inc, our mission is to Create Things People Like More — whether it's a product, an experience, or an internal tool, we believe in making the things around us better for our customers, and our team.  

  

Our mission extends beyond customers and team, to the community broadly. We believe that the best business models make a positive impact. So, we set aside 1% of sales across Harry's, Flamingo, and Lume to support our social mission, including through donations to our nonprofit partners.  

  

At the end of the day, the key to our success is our amazing people. From chemists, mechanical engineers, CX associates, to creative directors, sourcing managers, and logistics specialists, the Harry's team is composed of some of the most brilliant, diverse, and humble people you'll ever meet. Our company is a place of inclusion, innovation, and deeply ingrained values.

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/U--haul","http://www.uhaul.com/","2727 North Central Avenue

Ashby builds software that enables talent teams to run an efficient and delightful hiring process. Our software simplifies and automates complex workflows (like scheduling a candidate) and bundles what are traditionally different software tools into one.


As a result, our software is comprehensive *and* deep. It covers the feature set of at least four other products. It models the complexity of hiring at the scale of thousands of employees while deeply integrating with other systems like email and calendar. We accomplish much of this by creating reusable building blocks (e.g., a form builder for surveys and application forms) to provide a powerful feature set out-of-the-box while being familiar and easy to use.


Our approach presents some exciting challenges in QA-ing our software. First, it requires a deep understanding of recruiting to empower the creation of QA plans that cover use cases across our wide array of features and the seams between them. Second, it requires QA to be product experts to understand how a change (particularly to a building block) can propagate through our features to identify edge cases.


You will lead our QA team of three QA analysts to help us meet our unique challenges. You will set the larger vision on how QA evolves to reduce regressions while maintaining a high shipping velocity as the product, team, customer base, and customer size grow. Our team has already adopted QA tools (TestRail, Testim) and established some processes and metrics, so you’ll inherit a reasonably mature team for its size (versus starting from scratch).


This role will report to me and work closely with our Director of Engineering in EMEA, Colin. He has a passion for QA and will lead our testing strategy in Engineering. Together, you’ll set an industry-leading standard for software quality.

**Requirements**
================


I’m looking for someone exacting who manages their team with both empathy and rigor. While we’re open to folks with different levels of experience (hence the wide compensation range), we have some minimum requirements:

* **You work remotely in the US or Canada.** We prefer folks who can overlap with EMEA time zones, as we will add QA team members in EMEA to support our growing EMEA Engineering team.
* **You’ve managed a team of at least two QA analysts or engineers.** We want someone with great management instincts that have already been tested.
* **You’ve set a performance standard (e.g., levels, individual and team metrics).** This means you've documented a standard, measured that standard, and held your team accountable.
* **You’ve been integral to capacity planning for a QA team.** Our QA team needs to grow, and you’ll need to put together an argument about when and where.
* **You’ve evaluated and implemented software that improves or automates QA processes.**
* **You’ve led QA process changes** as an IC or manager with successful outcomes.

**Why You Shouldn’t Apply**
===========================

* **You are not interested in rolling up your sleeves and helping the team QA.** We run a lean team across all departments, and in yours, there will be times when demand for QA outpaces capacity. We also like folks who want to stay close to the work to evaluate methods and processes by doing it occasionally.
* **You don’t stay up-to-date on tools and processes for QA.** QA is evolving, especially with improvements in machine learning models and their ability to perform monotonous tasks faster and more accurately than humans. I don’t think QA will be an exception, and staying up-to-date on the state of the art is essential.
* **You don’t believe management needs to be in the details.** We believe managers need to monitor their team's work to evaluate and raise their team’s performance. For instance, your performance reviews are often filled with details and samples of work to prove areas of excellence or improvement.
* **You don’t believe evaluating QA quality and capacity can be driven by analysis and metrics.** We need you to be able to measure and forecast demand and capacity to grow the team deliberately.

**Interview Process**
=====================


At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past work and simulate working together.


Our interview process is six rounds in the following order:

* *Recruiter Intro Call* - 30m
* *Hiring Manager Intro Call* - 30m: You and I will chat about your application questions and answer any questions you have about the role.
* *Technical Screen* - 30m: We’ll send over documentation for a small feature in Ashby and talk live about how you’d approach building a QA plan.
* *Leadership Screen* - 60m: You and I will talk through your past experiences managing a team.
* *Technical Take Home* - 3h 30m: As a take-home, you build a QA plan for a feature in Ashby and discuss it live with three members of our team.
* *Meet the Team* - 2h 45m: You meet folks on the QA and Engineering teams. The sessions are primarily behavioral questions, with one session presenting a product you’ve worked on in the past to help us understand the depth of your product knowledge.


At each round, you’ll have an opportunity to ask questions of the team. After the recruiter screen, I will be your main point of contact and prepare you for interviews. If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!

**About Ashby**
===============


Ashby was founded in 2018, publicly launched in 2022, and has raised $70M in funding. We have many customers (e.g., OpenAI, Shopify), great revenue growth, years of runway, and amazing investors like YCombinator, Elad Gil, and Lachy Groom. I’ll share more once we meet.

**Benefits**
============

* Competitive salary and equity.
* *10-year exercise window for stock options.* You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.
* Unlimited PTO with four weeks recommended per year.
* *Twelve weeks of fully paid family leave in the US.* We plan to expand this to employees in other countries as situations arise.
* Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!
* $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.
* If you’re in the US, top-notch health insurance for you and your dependents with all premiums covered by us.


Ashby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.

Starting with his family's pizzerias, we now empower over tens of thousands of restaurants with the technology, services, and collective power that owners need to better serve their digitally minded customers and build lasting businesses. We're growing and adding more talent to help fulfill this valuable mission. That's where you come in.


**The Challenge to Solve**



Empower local business owners with an incredible in-store ordering experience that offers industry leading pricing and streamlines business operations.


**The Role**



As a Territory Manager, you will be responsible for driving the growth of your market. The Territory Manager team serves as the face of Slice in educating pizzeria owners about the value of partnering with Slice on our full suite of products to grow their business. Your goals will be a combination of new restaurant acquisition, upselling existing Slice partners on additional products and services, preventing shop churn, and building relationships with shop owners, both prospective and partners. The product suite you'll be selling and implementing within pizzerias includes Slice Register (our POS System), which is the core hub in the shop, as well as online ordering and the 'goods' (Slice supplies). In this role, you will oversee the whole sales and upsell process from prospect to pitch to close. You will primarily be traveling around your territory to meet with owners in person, while also spending time on the phone scheduling appointments and increasing touchpoints with owners. This is a high-velocity, strategic sales role with lots of daily touchpoints to different shops to achieve targets.


**The Team**



You will report to the Senior Manager of Northeast Territories and collaborate closely with our Head of Territory Management and Director of Sales Strategy. You will be part of a 'pod' that shares ownership of the market together which includes an Account Manager as well as yourself, and you will work together to achieve goals and exceed targets. You will be part of The Territory Management sales team that includes over 12 individuals throughout the country.


**The Winning Recipe**

We're looking for a highly-motivated, entrepreneurial individual who is comfortable closing sales, operating in ambiguous situations, and collaborating with various cross-functional teams to maximize success.



These are the core competencies this role calls for:


* 3-6 years of in-market selling or territory management experience (SMB and/or restaurant-tech industry is a plus, but not required)
* Strong track record of being a top performer and consistently exceeding goals
* Goal-oriented, excellent organizational abilities & relationship building skills, and a passion for managing the details
* A hustler who thrives in an ever-changing, fast-paced startup environment and is willing to contribute wherever necessary as plans and priorities change
* Excellent communication skills; effectively leads pitches and presentations and is comfortable both on the phone and in-market.
* Ability to problem-solve and cater pitches to address owner pain points in real time
* A go-getter who is coachable, adaptable, internally motivated, and resilient
* A valid driver's license and vehicle for travel
* Salesforce experience is ideal, not required
* Most importantly, you are excited about selling Slice and sharing our mission every day!


Note: you must be located in Bergen County to be considered for this opportunity.


**The Extras**



Working at Slice comes with a comprehensive set of benefits, but here are some of the unexpected highlights:


* Flexible PTO
* Market leading medical, vision and dental insurance
* 401K matching up to 4%
* Monthly wellness reimbursement/stipend
* Weekly pizza stipend (Yes, that's a thing!)


Salary range: $110-130k OTE + benefits


*The above represents the expected salary range for this job requisition. Ultimately, in determining your pay, we'll consider your location, experience, and other job-related factors.*


**The Hiring Process**



Here's what we expect the hiring process for this role to be, should all go well with your candidacy. This entire process is expected to take 2-3 weeks to complete and you'd be expected to start on a specific date.



* Application


* 30 minute introductory meeting with Recruiter


* 2 30 min meetings with Head of Sales and Director of Sales


* 45 min panel presentation and case study


* Offer!
