(CFR)is an award-winning, innovative law and policy organization that serves primarily Black and Brown families and youth in Queens, Manhattan, and the Bronx with an interdisciplinary legal defense model that serves more than 2400 clients every year. In 2024, CFR will expand our family defense practice to Richmond County. CFR was originally founded in 2002 to dramatically change the trajectory of indigent parents being prosecuted by the Citys Administration for Childrens Services (ACS). Our goal is to defend and protect our clients rights, reduce the harm of family separation and prevent or minimize the time any child spends in the foster system.


CFR provides interdisciplinary family defense with a model that was unique at our founding and that is now being replicated nationally: we assign every client an attorney and a social work staff member, and teams have the support of parent advocates, who are parents with direct personal experience of being investigated and prosecuted by ACS. CFR was the first agency in the country to integrate parents with lived experience into legal teams and now has 7 parent advocates working in all three of our family defense locations. CFRsCommunity Advocacy Projectrepresents parents during a child protective investigation (to avoid court involvement where possible) and assists parents in clearing their names from state maltreatment records.


As an agency committed to securing justice for families, we built theYouth Defense practice (YDP)to defend youth at risk of family separation through incarceration. YDP uses the same interdisciplinary model to represent youth being prosecuted in Queens and Manhattan in Supreme Court Youth Parts, during Probation Adjustment and in Delinquency proceedings in Family Court. CFRs Home for Good program provides legal and social work services to CFR clients inimmigration,civil legal servicesandcriminal defensematters, to afford clients an efficient and well-coordinated one-stop solution to a range of issues that threaten family stability.


Recognized as experts in our fields,we annually train over 500 practitioners in the city, state and around the countryon strategies to promote family preservation and interdisciplinary representation, and we provide community based Know Your Rights presentations to parents, youth and service providers.We advocate at the city, state and national level for policies that reduce the harm of family separation, and promote parent engagement and justice for youth and families.


CFR's Immigration Team has an immediate opening for a **Social Worker**.

**Primary responsibilities will include:**

* Work with CFRs immigration team to conduct trauma-informed intakes and meetings, assess needs and goals, provide high quality legal defense against family separation and removal and obtain immigration relief and/or benefits for non-citizen clients.
* In collaboration with our CFR Policy unit, other stakeholders and agencies, advocate against harmful anti-immigrant local/state/federal policies or practices;
* Provide direct social work support and advocacy to clients, refer clients to supportive services that are culturally and linguistically appropriate, facilitate clients attendance at ICE check-ins and other appointments and work closely with services providers (i.e. therapist, case managers, case planners, etc.) to create networks of support and gather evidence in support of clients cases;
* Conduct biopsychosocial evaluations and draft letters of support for clients to achieve positive outcomes with the immigration courts, USCIS, the Administration for Childrens Services and other agencies;
* Participate in team meetings as well as administrative meetings within CFR and
* Keep updated client legal notes and timely enter data in CFRs database.


Social Workers receive supervision from Social Work Supervisors and are expected to keep case data and client legal notes up to date. Social Workers at CFR can expect intensive, interdisciplinary training on CFR's Cornerstone Advocacy model, the immigration system, trauma-informed client interviewing, drafting client letters of support and other critical experiences and skills. Professional development opportunities for Social Workers may include building skills to eventually supervise MSW interns, conduct trainings and participate in CFR's policy initiatives. Objectives of the team include supporting non-citizen families by preventing removal, obtaining immigration relief, accessing benefits and seeking client opportunities.

**About our business**

The EY Forensic & Integrity Services practice advises corporations on complex business matters that require investigative work and analysis by our team using industry knowledge and the latest technology tools.

Titan is the rebel challenger in a very old industry. The present era is run by ancient players: Fidelity, Schwab, & Goldman Sachs. The problem is that none of them were built on modern rails and have horrible user experiences. There have been new things built (think: ""investing apps""). They are either 1) gimmicky casinos or 2) sleepy commodities. We won't say names. Why hasn't anyone built a modern Goldman Sachs for everyone? That's our mission.



Titan is a next-generation investment firm. We aspire to lead our generations' wealth.



We are fighters at heart. We fight to build products that are truly democratized. For example, we launched the first institutional grade cash management product open to everyday investors via Titan Smart Cash. We launched the first ever Venture fund for everyday investors in partnership with Cathie Wood's ARK. We've been able to raise significant capital from some of Silicon Valley's best, like a16z and General Catalyst.

* Stay up to date with the latest trends, developments, and offerings in the lifestyle space.
* Work collaboratively with the broader CX team on an ad-hoc basis depending on need and demand.
* Help us build a best-in-class team and company.
* Have fun.


**Qualifications**


* Previous experience in a CX or Concierge type of role (in person or remote experience)
