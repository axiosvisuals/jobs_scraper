NYC DOT has an exciting opportunity for a skilled, experienced, licensed professional engineer to lead a team of engineers and project managers in the execution of an ambitious citywide pedestrian ramp accessibility program.
  

  

The Pedestrian Ramp Program (PRP) is a unit within the Division of Sidewalk Inspection and Management (SIM). SIM is responsible for maintaining the city’s 12,760 miles of sidewalks and approximately 193,000 corners. Within SIM, PRP was formed to ensure that pedestrian ramps (a.k.a. curb ramps) at all corners in the city be brought to compliancy with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Standards. PRP works to address issues of ADA compliance with many stakeholders, including project sponsors, DOT units, outside agencies and stakeholders such as NYC DEP (Department of Environmental Protection), NYC DDC (Department of Design and Construction), NYC DOB (Department of Buildings), MTA, NYSDOT, private developers, and more.
  

  

The PRP Engineering Team is responsible for managing and coordinating the implementation of simple and complex pedestrian ramp contracts, design of pedestrian ramps, technical design review of infrastructure projects, assessment of ADA compliancy, reviewing of technical infeasibility documentation, and providing technical trainings in ADA compliance and design standards for inspectors, contractors, in-house teams, and other stakeholders.

The Assistant Director will be expected to handle some supervisory responsibilities and must show interest in developing management and leadership skills.

The Assistant Engineering Director will be responsible for reviewing work completed by engineering staff, reviewing and approving technical infeasibility documentation, assessing compliancy of pedestrian ramps and other elements of pedestrian facilities both in the office and in the field, developing unit and agency policies regarding accessibility and pedestrian ramps, maintaining and revising design standards, contracts, and specifications, reviewing projects for pedestrian ramp and ADA design requirements, developing 3D grading and geometric designs of pedestrian ramps, providing technical trainings, attending site visits to assess existing field conditions and construction related issues, developing innovative solutions, CADD standards, workflows, and processes to provide accessible streets throughout New York City. The candidate will collaborate with units in DOT, other agencies, contractors, consultants, vendors, and the public to achieve this and help ensure the agency achieves its goals of safety, access and mobility, livability, cost-effectiveness, sustainability, and resiliency; with emphasis on accessibility.  

  

Preferred Skills  

Candidate should possess managerial skills and have experience in a fast paced, large, complex organization; extensive experience in street reconstruction, design review, site grading, accessible design, project scoping and estimating, prior project management experience; have excellent writing and analytical skills; the ability to manage multiple priorities and the ability to develop collaborative working relationships.
