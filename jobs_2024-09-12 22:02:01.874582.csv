New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation

**Outposted Therapeutic Housing Units Program (OTxHU)**


Since 2016, Correctional Health Services (CHS) has been the direct provider of health care in the New York City jails. Deeply committed to human dignity and patient rights, CHS is part of the NYC Health + Hospitals system and is a key partner in the City’s efforts to reform the criminal-legal system. Our in-jail clinical services include medical, nursing, and mental health care; pharmacy services; substance-use treatment; social work; dental and vision care; discharge planning; and reentry support.

  

Given the high visibility of this initiative, we are seeking the highest caliber health care professionals in key clinical services to staff our Outposted Therapeutic Housing Units (OTxHU). To be located in three NYC Health + Hospital acute care facilities, the OTxHU is a pioneering approach to safely increasing access to high quality clinical care for patients in custody who have complicated health conditions. OTxHUs will bridge the gap in the continuum between care provided in the jails and inpatient hospitalization, with admission to and discharge from the OTxHU in accordance with a patient’s clinical needs. CHS will be the primary health care providers on these units and the NYC Department of Correction will provide security and custody management.

  

The OTxHU at NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue in Manhattan will be the first of this unique, groundbreaking project to open with a planned completion date as early as the end of 2024. This is an incredible opportunity to be part of a passionate and motivated team providing care to some of the City’s most marginalized, vulnerable people.

* To help support continuity of operations and care, staff selected to work in the OTxHU may also be required to work in CHS locations within the jails. Additionally, while CHS seeks the most qualified individuals for these positions, preference will be given to equally qualified, internal candidates.

Our goal is simple: To bring dog walking to the 21st century while preserving the highest degrees of reliability and trust.

**We offer competitive pay, customizable work schedules, tips, opportunities for pay increases, and a job you'll love!** 

This position is the dream job for anyone who would prefer spending their day soaking up some sun on a walk with a Golden pup, whipping out a laser toy for some kitty playtime, and capturing some adorable pics in a mini puppy photoshoot of your own.

At Swifto, your day will involve 5-6 walks or pet-sitting visits, depending on your availability. During each visit, you'll greet your furry friend, secure them with a leash or harness (if applicable), and enjoy your walk or playtime. You'll monitor their well-being, take cute photos for the client, and write a summary message about the walk or visit. By the end of the day, you'll know you've made some pets happy and their owners grateful!

At Swifto, we prioritize hiring dedicated dog walkers and pet sitters who are committed to the role long-term. Consistency is key for both our walkers and clients. A high percentage of our dog walks are repeating dog walks, allowing you to regularly care for the same pets and build lasting relationships with them.

**We’re looking for walkers and sitters who:**

* Are located in or willing to travel to Upper Manhattan Manhattan.
* Have experience working with a variety of dogs and cats.
* Genuinely love and respect dogs and cats.
* Have personally owned and cared for a dog or cat.
* Are comfortable working outdoors in all weather.
* **Be willing and able to establish a recurring weekly schedule, either Monday to Friday from 11 am-3 pm, evenings from 5-10 PM, or weekends on a consistent basis.**
* Are able to make at least a six-month commitment to working for Swifto.

**Bonus points for applicants who:**

* Have experience as or are training to be veterinarians/vet techs/dog trainers/etc.
* Know pet CPR.
* Have volunteered in animal shelters.
* Have worked in a doggy daycare.
* Have worked as a dog walker or pet sitter previously.

**Swifto perks:**

* You'll only walk dogs from a single household at a time, so no need to worry about pack walks.
* Immediate FREE telehealth medical appointments and FREE prescription coverage.
* You can control your schedule and build your route as you’d like.

**Compensation:** 

On an average day providing services for Swifto clients, you may do between five and ten walks/visits a day depending on your specific schedule. Take a look at the pay chart to calculate your earnings. For a 20 minute walk/visit, your starting pay is $12.50. So, if you do seven 20 minute walks/visits a day your starting pay would come out to be $87.50 per day + tips.

You are welcome to do as many walks/visits as you'd like per day, but keep in mind that it does take time to get from one client to the other. Every 400 walks or visits you complete will move you to the next pay tier, which comes with an automatic pay raise.

* ""Swifto is a great place to work. You walk one dog at a time, and set your own schedule, making it easy to do either as a second part-time job or as a full time job. You have repeating walks as your regular schedule, and can pick up one-time walks in addition. Management is easily accessible by text or via the app. This is a great gig for someone who loves dogs and prefers walking and being outdoors to sitting behind a desk.""

Each summer, CCRP runs an intensive ten-week summer conference on applied mathematical problems (SCAMP). The conference concentrates on a problem area in cryptology. Some 20-25 academic mathematicians are invited to join with our research staff for these conferences.



The visitors are a very strong group of research mathematicians ranging in age from undergraduates to emeritus professors. In recent years, we have made a particular effort to include some undergraduate and/or graduate students who have demonstrated outstanding talent.



Typically, we have a mix of new and returning participants, depending upon individual proclivity for and interest in the particular problem set. Those having an outstanding talent for our problems may also be invited to join our permanent research staff.



The format of the program is rather relaxed. The first two weeks are spent attending lectures where the problems are described, the remaining eight weeks permanent research and program participants spend working on whatever problem, or piece thereof, is of interest to them. Joint work is encouraged and informal bull sessions or lectures are used to present partial results or even half baked ideas which often stimulate better ideas.



Cryptology, as a field of applied mathematics, is remarkable for the range of abstract mathematics which finds striking application. As might be expected, algebra, number theory, combinatorics and statistics play a major role, but topology, algebraic geometry and harmonic analysis have been the source of unexpected and critical contributions. One has an extraordinary opportunity to see an abstract theory turned into an effective tool solving real problems. On the one hand, this provides a deep understanding of the theory and its ramifications; and on the other, provides the exhilaration of solving problems of immediate and substantial importance.

There are over 30M small businesses in the United States, but only a tiny fraction of them have a workplace savings program in place. As the savings gap in the country widens, it's imperative that every worker has access to and participates in their company's savings program, such as a 401(k) or 403(b). We believe that American workers should have easy access to an inexpensive, flexible, and intuitive solution to save for a brighter future.  

  

Unfortunately, prior to Vestwell, small businesses have been neglected and underserved, with expensive, inflexible, poorly designed offerings built on old, mainframe software. Vestwell is changing that, starting with rebuilding the core infrastructure for the modern era.  

  

Vestwell's north star is to be the engine behind a $30T industry, powering all payroll-deducted workplace savings programs for small-to-midsize businesses, such as 401(k), 403(b), IRA, emergency savings accounts (ESA), health savings accounts (HSA), 529 college savings, and alike.  

  

Vestwell's focus is to build the most flexible, powerful workplace savings and investment platform, delivered through the hands and minds of their financial services partners with the help of payroll provider partners. The team at Vestwell makes the hard stuff look easy, by combining the expertise of financial advice with the sophistication of a technology provider.  

  

As a result, workplace providers are able to bestow the advice and solution employers and employees have been asking for, while growing and scaling along the way. Employers get a cost-effective solution designed for their needs without all the headaches, and employees get a user-friendly portal that helps them achieve their long-term saving goals.


**WHY VESTWELL?**



With backing from leading FinTech investors, as well as a growing team of dedicated professionals of strong industry pedigree, Vestwell is at the forefront of a much-needed change in a 40-year old industry. Our team believes in the mission we've set out to achieve and we are working hard to get there. We're ambitious, honest, thoughtful, and fun.

We provide our team with all the equipment they need (plus a few perks!) to work effectively remotely. Oh, and naturally we have a great 401(k) plan!


**OUR PROCESS**  

  

It starts the same for every candidate: getting to know the team members through 1 - 2 conversations about Vestwell, your experience, and your interests. Next steps can vary by role, but the usual next steps are a skill or experience screen (e.g. a coding interview for an Engineer, a portfolio review for a Designer, deeper experience call for other roles) which leads to a virtual or in-person interview panel after that if the screens go well. *Before making an offer, our interview process concludes with a references check stage for your recruiter to meet with a current or former supervisor and peer.* We prioritize transparency and lack of surprise throughout the process.

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington).
