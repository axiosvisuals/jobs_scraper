Sixty-nine percent live in Queens; the rest come from Brooklyn and beyond. Virtually all LaGuardia students are ethnic minorities (88 percent), 58 percent are women, and 31 percent are over the age of 25. Forty-eight percent of LaGuardia students are Hispanic, making the college a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI). Sixty-six percent of LaGuardia students receive financial aid.

One of every five families in the United States suffers from serious housing deprivation. They either live in physically inadequate buildings, suffer from severe overcrowding, or spend an excessive proportion of their income for shelter. Housing costs have increased to the point that millions of families cannot obtain decent housing unless they deprive themselves of other essentials of life. Only fifteen percent of American families can afford to purchase a median-priced new home. Our Catholic tradition insists that shelter is one of the basic rights of the human person.

**WHO ARE WE**  

Generator is on a journey. Appropriate, given that we're a leading global lifestyle accommodation brand. The journey began in London, swung through a heap of European capitals on its way to dominating the world. Generator burst onto the scene in the Americas with the launch of Generator Miami and Generator DC and most recently took aim at the country’s biggest markets (NYC, LA, Miami and Chicago) with the acquisition of Freehand Hotels.


No biggie. Fast Company named us one of the top 50 most innovative global companies. We, of course, agree. And now this top 50 most innovative global company (did we mention that?) wants an awesome Sales Manager for the 7 US properties.


Our spaces are safe and seriously social, in the proudest part of the beating heart of the cities we love. Cultural action, creative pulse and an outstanding way to waste some of the finite time the universe has given you - that's what Generator offers. Holds true for staff and visitors equally, and while chic design is always the backdrop, every Generator in every destination reflects the unique beat of that city's heart.


BEING YOURSELF is the key to bringing the Generator story and brand to life.
