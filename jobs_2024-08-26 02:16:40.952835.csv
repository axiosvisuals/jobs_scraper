**Who we are:**


Have you ever wondered what happens to cats and dogs whose owners are unable to afford veterinary care? We did. The ASPCA’s Community Medicine (CM) team provides expert veterinary care to support the welfare of animals and their people through our stationary and mobile veterinary clinics, serving the most underserved communities in New York, Miami, and Los Angeles. We help pet owners overcome barriers to care, bringing quality services directly to the communities that need us most and partially or fully subsidizing the cost of basic and preventive care. CM treats people and pets with dignity and respect, assisting pet owners in making informed decisions about their pets’ health and wellbeing regardless of their financial circumstances.

You’ll work closely with other Medical Managers at the clinic to coordinate the flow of work throughout the day and the cooperation between their teams and to support each other.

**What you’ll get:**
