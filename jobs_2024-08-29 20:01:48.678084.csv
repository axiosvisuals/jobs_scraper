We are working tirelessly to create a future where we Rise Above Violence and our communities can innovate towards collective well-being, restoration, and social justice. Womankind provides comprehensive direct services that support the healing path of survivors, their children, and their families due to gender-based violence.

Survivors of domestic and sexual violence can find refuge, recovery and renewal at Womankind’s two emergency residences. We strive to offer support and assistance in accessing services and resources. Our goal is to provide support and guidance to survivors so that they can live their lives free of abuse. We believe this is achieved when they can gain harmony in their lives and a sense of belonging to a community. Through these gains, individuals can recover from trauma and pursue independent lives.

The residential programs at Womankind are unique in that:

* We utilize a survivor-centered, trauma-informed, culturally congruent, and evidence-informed model of practice called MAP (Moving Ahead Positively). Survivors can transcend from trauma through assistance in regaining trust and hope, which predominantly occurs via the power of relationship.
* Holistic wellness is another crucial component that is explored within residential services as trauma impacts the body, mind and spirit as much as it impacts life circumstances. Through voluntary group and individual wellness practices including acupuncture, trauma-sensitive yoga, Qi Gong exercises, and meditation, survivors have an opportunity to engage in a reconnection of the body, mind and spirit.
* We also seek to support the development of a community of support for processing and understanding the individual impact of trauma. In integrating our services throughout our various community-based programming, more avenues of assistance and support is offered to a survivor who can now pick and choose options of service provision that best meet their respective needs. For example, children and youth can participate in therapeutic art-based programs. Housing, employment and legal immigration services are also available.
* While Womankind serves mostly women and children, we take pride in providing services to survivors of various gender identities.

**Essential Functions**

* Manage a caseload of 5-9 clients within the Residential Programs, providing counseling, case management and accompaniment services for clients’ legal, immigration, entitlement, and housing needs.
* Maintain proper documentation of case work and organization of case files.
* Contribute to supporting the well-being and advancement of families via structured activities and collaborating with children’s programming to support the enhancement of the bond within the family unit, advocate and fellow team members within the Residential Programs, and across the organization.
* Provide facilitation of support groups based on the needs of the house at the time

This stance accounts for a good working environment at Miele and the success of our products.



Our colleagues can rest assured that those who live up to our standards of quality and professionalism grow personally and professionally. No matter if they are at entry levels or managers.

""Immer Besser"" is therefore an entrepreneurial success principle from which customers and employees benefit in equal measure. We call this principle ""MAKE IT BETTER. BE BETTER"".

**ABOUT MIELE**



What does it take for a family run company to become world market leader in the premium domestic appliance and commercial machine segment? It takes more than offering average products, run-of-the-mill service or short-sighted actions. It also requires the aspiration to do it forever better and to be forever better. This stance accounts for a good working environment at Miele and the success of our products.



Our colleagues can rest assured that those who live up to our standards of quality and professionalism grow personally and professionally. No matter if they are at entry levels or managers.



Miele asks a lot of its employees. They are expected to develop and manufacture worldwide market premium products that are ""Immer Besser"". In return, they receive the most valuable thing Miele can give them: that they themselves become ""Immer Besser"" - in all of their professional and personal abilities.



""Immer Besser"" is therefore an entrepreneurial success principle from which customers and employees benefit in equal measure. We call this principle ""MAKE IT BETTER. BE BETTER"".
