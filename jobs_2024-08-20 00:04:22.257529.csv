They may reinforce concepts, provide clarification, or guide students through specific learning tasks based on data collected. Associate teachers also collect data while the lead teacher is teaching.

As the point person for major gift fundraising, the Director will spend much of their workday outside of the office, meeting with parents, alumnae, and other constituents. They will spearhead highly effective prospective donor pipeline management. They will also serve as a strategic partner to the Director of Institutional Advancement, particularly in the area of campaign project management.


The successful candidate will be an energetic and seasoned fundraiser and natural relationship builder, whose experience in raising major gifts will help advance the school's mission and strengthen the culture of philanthropy at Nightingale. The Director of Major Gifts must be comfortable operating in New York City’s business and philanthropic communities. A background in major gift fundraising and a successful track record of soliciting and closing six-figure and higher gifts is required, along with exceptional communication skills. The Director will maintain a portfolio of at least 100 donors and prospective donors with the capacity to give at the six-figure level and above. The Director will be expected to be available to travel outside the New York City area and attend evening and weekend meetings and events when necessary.

The Director will also have a mind for details and organization, such that they can be an effective strategic partner while also driving the work forward. Candidates with both skill sets are preferred.


Founded by two bold, visionary educators in 1920, The Nightingale-Bamford School’s mission is to inspire girls to go beyond barriers. Tied to this mission is a broader vision of students who are joyful learners who have the intellectual depth and courage to be critical thinkers, compassionate citizens, and agents of their own lives. Nightingale educates girls’ minds and hearts and, in so doing, infuses their lives with meaningful relationships, teaching them to value difference as a means of growth, and empowering them to question the status quo with confidence, empathy, resilience, and reason. Nightingale’s commitment to social justice and anti-racism requires that all community members engage actively and thoughtfully in work around diversity, equity, and inclusion.


Nightingale enters its second century in full embrace of the philosophy established by its founders. As Miss Nightingale and Miss Bamford believed, girls’ schools educate girls best, and a purposeful curriculum is a matter of both mind and heart. At Nightingale, each girl can expect an education that prepares them for success. Led by a fully engaged and student-focused faculty and administration, they will be ready for whatever the world presents to them. From the moment each girl enters the blue doors, they are acknowledged, understood, and valued.


Generations of Nightingale alumnae have led lives of meaning, a testament to the power of its founders’ vision. Ensuring that the same opportunities exist for future generations of students is of primary importance. Thus, Nightingale is committed to maintaining wise stewardship of its financial resources, planning now for a sustainable future, including fostering a philanthropy culture that supports Nightingale’s current program and its vision for the future.


A bachelor’s degree or an equivalent combination of education and experience and at least three years of experience in a leadership position directing fundraising efforts for philanthropic or nonprofit organizations is preferred for this position. The Nightingale-Bamford School will consider candidates with a broad range of backgrounds. If you are excited about this role and feel that you can contribute to Nightingale-Bamford, but your experience does not exactly align with every qualification listed above, we encourage you to apply.


All applications must be accompanied by a cover letter and résumé. Cover letters should be responsive to the mission of The Nightingale-Bamford School as well as the responsibilities and qualifications presented in the prospectus.


The salary for this position is $150,000 to $170,000 annually.


The Nightingale-Bamford School is committed to the inclusion of all qualified candidates.

APPLY

  

The Office of University Investments (OUI) is seeking highly qualified, entry level Investment Analysts for its analyst program. This is a three-year term position in OUI’s **New York City** office with a start date of summer 2025.

  

No relocation assistance is provided for this position.


No Visa sponsorship is provided for this position.

  

US nationals and applicants with a current visa status (including OPT) who do not require Visa sponsorship will be considered for this opportunity.

 *Please note*: A PDF resume **must** be attached to the candidate's application materials (labeled LastFirstOUI).

 **Who we are:**


OUI manages the University’s approximately $10 billion endowment, which supports the University’s mission by seeking to generate superior risk-adjusted returns. OUI seeks to achieve this goal by pursuing a very broad set of investment opportunities. The global, multiple-asset class approach taken exploits a central insight of modern financial theory: namely, that portfolio risk can be minimized for any targeted rate of return through the inclusion of a broad selection of asset classes – since risky asset classes often behave differently as regional and global economic, financial, and political events unfold.

  

The Chief Investment Officer is responsible for the day-to-day oversight of the Investment Office and is supported by a dedicated team of investment professionals. The Investment Office is responsible for implementing policies established by the University Board of Trustees and its Investment Committee. To learn more about OUI’s policies, objectives, and organizational structure, please visit our website: https://www.investmentoffice.cornell.edu/.

 **Analyst Program Purpose and Goals:**


Through a wide variety of asset class, operations, and portfolio and risk analytics assignments, Investment Analysts are expected to acquire a deep knowledge of issues surrounding the development and execution of a robust global, multi-asset class, long-term oriented institutional investment strategy. Analysts work with senior team members in the investment analysis and due diligence process and take on numerous analytic, quantitative, and qualitative projects on an independent basis to facilitate the overall investment process. In contrast to more narrowly defined entry-level finance positions, Investment Analysts are assigned a broad and deep range of asset class exposure and projects covering all aspects of institutional portfolio construction and management over the course of the three-year period.

  

As part of the program, OUI encourages and supports Investment Analysts as they pursue the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation as well as one other professional credential (CAIA, FRM, CIPM, etc.).

 **Responsibilities:**

* Collaborate with senior team members on work related to investment underwriting including investment sourcing, due diligence, and structuring of new investments.
* Work independently to provide detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis in support of investment underwriting.
* Evaluate and engage with existing investments and manager relationships by analyzing reports, attending meetings with managers, identifying potential issues, and proactively providing relevant updates and/or necessary solutions to emerging issues.
* Use rigorous quantitative/statistical techniques and apply and/or develop innovative modelling skills to analyze current and prospective investments and conduct portfolio-level analyses.
* Acquire a deep understanding of portfolio rebalancing and optimization, asset class construction, and investment valuation and relative valuation techniques.
* Execute a wide variety of performance, risk measurement, and attribution analyses.

**Required Qualifications:**

* **Bachelor's degree or equivalent:** All majors are encouraged to apply (Master’s degree candidates welcome). Disciplines on our team have recently included: Business, Finance, Economics, Engineering (Biological, Biomedical, Chemical, Mechanical, Operations Research, Computer Science, Engineering Management), French, Actuarial Science, Biology, English Literature, Statistics, Physics, Physiology, Psychology*.*
* **Relevant experience:** Up to 1 year of related or relevant experience.
* **Excellent qualitative and interpersonal skills:** Applicants must be capable of interacting effectively with external investment managers, the campus community, and the University's Investment Committee.
* **Strong quantitative capabilities:** Significant coursework in one or more of the following fields (even if not a major) is highly valued: statistics, mathematics, computer science, operations research, science, and/or information systems (evidenced via a transcript or other documentation).
* **A background check** will be required.

**Desired Skills:**

* Demonstrated interest in learning about investment theory and practice, economics, and financial markets.
* Willingness to undertake the CFA Program upon joining (see https://www.cfainstitute.org/ for background on the CFA® credential).
* Ability to prioritize and manage multiple projects and meet deadlines in a thorough and detail-oriented fashion.
* Strong written and oral communication skills.
* Enthusiasm for supporting the mission of higher education and representing the University in a professional manner.
* Evidence of ability to work in teams, positive attitude, and ability to gain and maintain credibility with the campus community and investment managers.
* Willingness to travel, at times extensively, on average 15% of the time.
* Proficiency in spreadsheet software and mathematics/quantitative technique.
* Demonstrated programming skills in one or more of the following languages: R, VBA, Python, SQL, SAS, Tableau, C#.
* 6 months experience (relevant internships, teaching assistant work, etc. count toward this) or combination of education and experience is desirable (but not mandatory).

**Rewards and Benefits:**

* Cornell receives national recognition as an award-winning workplace for our health, wellbeing, sustainability, and diversity initiatives.
* Our benefits programs include comprehensive health care options, generous retirement contributions, access to wellness programs, and employee discounts with local and national retail brands.

But we've got more left to do — and that's where you come in!



Duolingo is the world's most popular learning app. Beyond our core learning product, we also offer English proficiency testing with the Duolingo English Test, and are bringing new subjects into the Duolingo app, where people can develop their Math and Music skills.



We are passionate about educating our users, making fact-based decisions, and finding innovative solutions to complex problems. We offer meaningful work, limitless learning opportunities, and collaboration with world-class minds. Come brighten your life and over half a billion more!



As an Engineering Director at Duolingo, you'll have the unique opportunity to shape the future of learning by leading cross-functional teams in developing innovative solutions. This role combines strategic leadership, business insight, and technical knowledge. Essential to the role is the ability to effectively handle complex leadership situations, ensuring alignment and delivering impact.


**Learning R&D Area:**


* The Learning R&D Area works on improving the learning experience of our users with new bets, technologies, and features, that fill the learning gaps in our product. Our goal is to make Duolingo the best way to level up your language skills, regardless of your proficiency level.


**Growth Area:**


* The Growth Area focuses on attracting new users, retaining current users, and bringing users back to Duolingo. More users = more data (so we can teach better) and more paid subscribers (so we can invest in making the app even better, and keep the lights on!). Our area's goal is to make Duolingo so fun and delightful that our learners stick around to make real progress and tell their friends all about it!


**You will...**


* Define the strategy and set the roadmap for your teams
* Be a strong cross-functional partner with product, design and data science (and other functions, depending on the product area) and invest in those relationships.
* Be an excellent manager of managers, training and coaching newer managers and engineering leads.
* Navigate complex leadership skills of being inclusive of different viewpoints; checking for alignment; and knowing when it's best to pushback vs. make a decision vs. ""disagree and commit.""
* Shape key decisions about architecture and implementation of scalable and high quality engineering solutions
* Drive the planning, execution, and success of elegant technical projects


**You have...**


* Strong technical chops. This is table-stakes. Our engineering leads are not only excellent people managers, team builders and strategic thinkers. They also have the deep technical background which allows them to ""trust, but verify"" that the right technical decisions are being made and that their area is executing strongly. They allocate time for learning in order to stay on top of technical advances.
* Strong business acumen. This means having a deep understanding of their part of the business; following industry trends; and being able to think several years ahead.
* Solid product sense. Engineering leads at Duolingo don't ""stay in their lane."" They use the product and features that they are building every day, are deeply familiar with how it works and have strong opinions of what's working well in the product, what could be improved, and what to build next. They also use products/apps from peer industries (gaming, for instance) to learn from best-in-class.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Duolingo","https://www.duolingo.com","Pittsburgh","11 to 50","$1M to $5M (USD)","","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/0635b8ac456a3946e4ce87b76c41e944","","",""

But we've got more left to do — and that's where you come in!



Duolingo is the world's most popular learning app. Beyond our core learning product, we also offer English proficiency testing with the Duolingo English Test, and are bringing new subjects into the Duolingo app, where people can develop their Math and Music skills.



We are passionate about educating our users, making fact-based decisions, and finding innovative solutions to complex problems. We offer meaningful work, limitless learning opportunities, and collaboration with world-class minds. Come brighten your life and over half a billion more!



As an Engineering Director at Duolingo, you'll have the unique opportunity to shape the future of learning by leading cross-functional teams in developing innovative solutions. This role combines strategic leadership, business insight, and technical knowledge. Essential to the role is the ability to effectively handle complex leadership situations, ensuring alignment and delivering impact.


**Developer Productivity Area:**


* The Developer Productivity area builds the foundation for mobile app development across Duolingo's engineering organization through consistent and scalable architecture and tooling. Our goal is to empower engineers to ship stable, performant, and well-tested experiences without sacrificing velocity or functionality.


**You will...**


* Define the strategy and set the roadmap for your teams
* Be a strong cross-functional partner with product, design and data science (and other functions, depending on the product area) and invest in those relationships.
* Be an excellent manager of managers, training and coaching newer managers and engineering leads.
* Navigate complex leadership skills of being inclusive of different viewpoints; checking for alignment; and knowing when it's best to pushback vs. make a decision vs. ""disagree and commit.""
* Shape key decisions about architecture and implementation of scalable and high quality engineering solutions
* Drive the planning, execution, and success of elegant technical projects


**You have...**


* Strong technical chops. This is table-stakes. Our engineering leads are not only excellent people managers, team builders and strategic thinkers. They also have the deep technical background which allows them to ""trust, but verify"" that the right technical decisions are being made and that their area is executing strongly. They allocate time for learning in order to stay on top of technical advances.
* Strong business acumen. This means having a deep understanding of their part of the business; following industry trends; and being able to think several years ahead.
* Solid product sense. Engineering leads at Duolingo don't ""stay in their lane."" They use the product and features that they are building every day, are deeply familiar with how it works and have strong opinions of what's working well in the product, what could be improved, and what to build next. They also use products/apps from peer industries (gaming, for instance) to learn from best-in-class.
