Our schools provide all students, regardless of their previous academic history, the highest quality education in an atmosphere of respect, responsibility and rigor. We ensure that our students have the skills and knowledge to graduate ready for college, pursue a career, and engage with the 21st century economy. We develop learning experiences that allow risk-taking, cultivate students' imaginative and creative abilities, and celebrate achievement. Through an intensive study of math concepts in our math and science schools, and literature, English, social studies and arts in our humanities schools, students learn how to generate research questions, develop the skills necessary to answer those questions, create products that demonstrate understanding, and defend their knowledge publicly.

* Develop long-term and short-term intervention plans consistent with curriculum, with students’ needs, strengths, diversity and life experiences, and with other social and emotional factors
* Use assessment and evaluation results to develop appropriate interventions for students, families, schools and communities
* Provide services to students in ways that build upon individual strengths and offer students maximum opportunities to participate in the planning and direction of their own learning experience

Once employed, faculty that exemplify high performance are able to advance through our career ladder quickly, and there are additional opportunities for teachers to increase their pay through the acquisition of additional certifications

Starting with his family's pizzerias, we now empower over tens of thousands of restaurants with the technology, services, and collective power that owners need to better serve their digitally minded customers and build lasting businesses. We're growing and adding more talent to help fulfill this valuable mission. That's where you come in.


**The Challenge to Solve**



Buying affordable, high quality supplies is one of the biggest challenges facing local independent restaurants today; they pay higher prices than franchises and often must use outdated systems to place & receive their orders. Slice's ""The Goods"" seeks to solve this challenge by empowering local pizzeria owners to order high-quality supplies at unmatched prices, on demand, in just a few clicks.


**The Role**



The Head Logistics position for 'The Goods' is an imperative role to the business as we grow and require someone who is both pragmatic and a strategic thinker. You will design how our warehouses and fulfillments will operate with considerations around promoting and driving a safety culture, efficiency, profitability and ultimately shop satisfaction. The ability to cultivate relationships both with the team and our shop owners will also be key to the success of this role.


**Other areas of the role will be:**


* Lead your team with infectious energy and work ethic as you foster a growth mindset culture where people feel appreciated
* Design operational controls that will allow KPIs to be monitored, analyzed and utilized appropriately; particularly for improvement opportunities
* Develop relationships with internal 'The Goods' teams, as well as other cross-functional slice teams, to positively impact customer satisfaction and retention
* Create and implement yearly EBITDA budget, encompassing tasks such as expense and capital budget allocation, strategic planning, inventory management for both assets and products (including SKUs), overseeing cost containment measures, setting revenue and productivity targets, analyzing and interpreting reports and metrics, and ensuring operational excellence
* Design and implement operational processes and systems across: receiving, inventory management, picking/packing, delivery, and payments that lead to shop satisfaction, on time and accurate deliveries, at lowest possible costs


**The Team**



The Supply Chain team (AKA The Goods) includes our VP, Supply Chain and a collaborative group working in specific territories throughout the East Coast. You will also collaborate with local pizzeria and restaurant owners to understand their needs and demonstrate how Slice can help their business. You will be a key member of Slice's growing 'The Goods' team and report to Slice's VP, Supply Chain.


**The Winning Recipe**


* 7+ years of distinguished leadership experience in supply chain, distribution, transportation, and manufacturing, showcasing a track record of navigating complex profit and loss scenarios
* Demonstrated dedication to customer service excellence
* Proven experience in warehouse operations
* A knack for instigating and leading transformative changes within an organization
* Profound comprehension and practical application of lean principles and methodologies
* Adeptness in problem-solving, backed by sharp analytical and organizational skills
* A relentless drive toward goal achievement and continuous enhancement
* Proven prowess in persuasion, inspiration, influence, and negotiation
* Openness and readiness to travel as needed


Note: you must be located in the Northeast to be considered for this opportunity.


**The Extras**



Working at Slice comes with a comprehensive set of benefits, but here are some of the unexpected highlights:



Flexible PTO



Market leading medical, vision and dental insurance



401K matching up to 4%



Wellness reimbursement/stipend



Weekly pizza stipend (Yes, that's a thing!)

  

**The Hiring Process**



Here's what we expect the hiring process for this role to be, should all go well with your candidacy. This entire process is expected to take 1-2 weeks to complete and you'd be expected to start on a specific date.


* Application
* 30 minute introductory meeting with recruiter

* Two separate 30 meeting meetings with an executive leader
* Offer!

New York City Transit is looking for customer communicators with extensive social media experience to provide world class customer care for the millions of people we move each day. In this role, you will translate information about current subway and bus service received from multiple channels into customer-facing communications and publish it across multiple channels, including mta.info, the MTA app and third-party apps, @NYCTSubway and @NYCTBus on X (Twitter), and screens in subway stations and on buses.

**Responsibilities**  

  

The selected candidate will monitor New York City’s subway and bus services in real-time to determine customer impact, translate internal service change messages into customer facing communications and quickly publish to multiple channels, monitor social chatter, determine the best approach for individual customer queries, and respond accordingly, in plain language (non-jargon) and with a conversational tone. The selected candidate will also escalate urgent issues to operations staff and senior leadership as needed, manage customer queries from start to finish, which may require follow up days later, seek opportunities for improving proactive service communications, brand building, and storytelling for all NYCT services. The selected candidate must be able to and available to work in a 24/7 environment that includes weekdays, overnight shifts, weekends and/or holidays as required.
