The path to becoming a Financial Planner begins with the Pre-Contract CDP Affiliate phase, during which you will study towards obtaining the required FINRA and resident state licenses, with the cost of fees and exam study materials from approved vendors covered by the Company. Upon successful completion of the Pre-Contract Affiliate phase, should you receive and accept an offer to commence part-time employment as a CDP Contract Associate, compensation is initially expected to be $15/hour (or your city/state’s applicable minimum wage if higher than $15/hr). After successful completion of the CDP Contract Associate phase, you may receive an offer to become a full-time Financial Professional Associate (FPA), which is paid solely on a commission and bonus basis. FPAs regularly earn average compensation ranging from $50,000 - $75,000 in commissions and bonuses in their first full year. In addition, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable plans then in effect, eligible FPAs may enroll in a 401(k) plan, as well as participate in Company-sponsored medical, dental, vision, and basic life insurance plans for the FPA and the FPA’s eligible dependents and may be eligible for paid leave.

**General Statement:**

This statute defines an ESL program as ""a program that uses only English as the instructional language for eligible students and enables such students to achieve English proficiency and academic mastery of subject matter content and higher order skills, including critical thinking, so as to meet appropriate grade promotion and graduation requirements.""  

  

EL teachers are specially trained instructors who teach individuals who are not native speakers of English. In Stamford, an EL teacher may work with students qualifying for bilingual or English as a Second Language (ESL) services. EL teachers work to make the core curriculum comprehensible for ELs while building language proficiency in English. EL teachers work primarily providing direct services, such as ESL instruction, but may provide indirect services, such as consultation with classroom teachers and push-in to mainstream classrooms, to eligible students who have proficiencies ranging from scale of 1-5 on the LAS. The primary role of the EL teacher is to enable eligible students to access academic curriculum and gain linguistic proficiency in English.  

  

Educational programs for ELs are regulated by the Every Student Succeeds Act, Title I and Title III. The EL teacher receives supervision from building administration and technical supervision and assistance from the Coordinator of English Learners (EL).  

  

**Major Responsibilities:**  

+ Provide instruction for students who are eligible to receive EL services
+ Make accommodations to curriculum so that content is accessible for ELs
+ Follow a push-in or pull-out model to meet service requirements and to best service students
+ Provide expertise to building principals and Coordinator of EL for planning and implementing programs which address the needs and abilities of the identified EL student population
+ Maintain appropriate documents on assessment of ELs
+ Consult with classroom teachers as appropriate to support access to curriculum and instruction
+ Check in with academic subject area teachers to ensure that ELs are doing well in content area classes
+ Provide strategies to content area teachers on how to successfully include ELs at higher linguistic levels
+ Act as a resource to teachers of EL eligible students in developing differentiated strategies for students with limited proficiency in English
+ Collaborate to support EL students identified as needing additional support on the EL Monitoring Report
+ Assist in the annual assessment of identified EL students as mandated by State and Federal statutes
+ Communicate with parents/guardians of EL students
+ Assist the Coordinator of EL in maintaining records and reports as requested by local, state or federal agencies
+ Work with building administration to develop reasonable schedules for servicing students
+ Performs additional duties as assigned

  

  

**Qualifications:**  

+ CT CSDE certification endorsed for Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL), PK–12 (111)
+ Experience working with EL students preferred
+ Demonstrated excellence in teaching
+ Superior organizational skills
+ Demonstrated ability to work effectively with administrators, teachers, parents and students

Using Solution Based Casework, we actively work with parents to help them develop a more active, consistent and productive role in their child’s educational and social development; we encourage families to build connections to positive supports in their community who will help them sustain their progress. Our goal is to partner with families to keep them together while ensuring that children will be safely cared for.
