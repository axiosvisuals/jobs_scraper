The Exit 4 Food Hall is the first of its kind in Westchester County offering local, freshly-prepared food and drinks.

The food emphasizes locally-sourced and artisanal crafted items, with constantly changing menus featuring fresh and seasonal food. Our mantra is ""slow food....fast."" Exit 4 is also highly focused on providing a casual, fun and communal experience with an eclectic décor highlighted by one of a kind items with local ingredients prepared our way. We believe in sustainability and leaving the smallest carbon footprint possible-and a few examples of this in our everyday service is: serving our wine and beer on tap (no bottle waste); serving filtered water in our own glass, reusable bottles (no plastic bottle waste); and using Green Box (a box that serves as plates and gets smaller for left-overs) for our largest delivery/take-out item, pizza. We also make sure that any daily left-over food is distributed to our needy in the local community. We opened in February of 2016 to fill a need in our community.

Mobile Response services are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, to help children and youth who are experiencing emotional or behavioral crises. The services are designed to defuse an immediate crisis, keep children and their families safe, and maintain the children in their own homes or current living situation (such as a foster home, treatment home or group home). Mobile response/crisis intervention workers respond to calls received by the program through a centralized screening entity that determines the need for services. Workers must respond to calls within one hour by traveling to wherever the crisis occurs, such as in the child's/family's home, in school, or other community locations. The Mobile Response program utilizes agency-owned cars that workers use to drive to the site of the crisis.

**A Day in the Life of a Caregiver**

In the simplest terms, a caregiver is a person who provides care for another. When it comes to our team, caregivers play a vital role. Our caregivers are the driving force for positively improving the lives of seniors in our community. They make a direct impact in providing care to seniors who wish to age in the safety and comfort of their home instead of an assisted living facility, an independent living facility, a senior living community, or a nursing home. Every client will have different needs that they require assistance with, but we make sure to match our clients and caregivers together for the optimal fit.
