**Address:**



101 Hudson Street



21st Floor



07302 Jersey City

  



The world of work is changing…short commutes, flexibility, and convenience are the minimum standards employees want when it comes to how they want to work!



At IWG, we are leading the way. We’ve built the world’s largest workspace network so that our customers can work from wherever, and however, they want… in over 120 countries across the globe!



Join us and help us bring more freedom to people and businesses, while expanding our network. You’ll be able to enjoy a great work life balance and competitive benefits, while growing your career path along the way.

  


**The opportunity**



As a Community Associate, you’ll work closely with new and existing customers across a myriad of industries, working to create and maintain your own community within your center, where you will help take care of all the administrative and support needs for your customers…so that your customers can focus on running their business.

  


**A typical day at IWG**

You arrive a few minutes before your center opens to make sure everything is ready and check there’s nothing the cleaners have missed.



Customers arrive all throughout the morning. One asks you for a changed WiFi code. Another wants to know if his important package has arrived. A woman needs directions to her meeting room… and can you help her set up the projector and show her where to find a great cup of coffee. You’re off to help her get set-up, as soon as you connect the incoming call to another customer. You may sure that all of the services are properly charged, so that invoices are accurate.



It’s time for a quick coffee break, relax and enjoy a few minutes to yourself.



The mail arrives. You sort through it while dealing with a whole host of other customer requests, remembering to email the customer from earlier to let him know his package is waiting for him in his mailbox. And that’s lunch.



A new wave of customers arrive throughout the afternoon. You help a customer with printing and another with their invoice. A customer in a team room say it’s too hot in their office, no problem you are on it and open a ticket in our service portal.



You’ve earned yourself another quick coffee break, relax and enjoy a few minutes to yourself.



Early afternoon, you sit down with the Community Manager to discuss the organization of next week’s networking event in your center. You plan and write the e-invites to customers, then create, print and put-up posters on the noticeboards around the center. To your excitement, the Community Manager is coming around the corner with a prospect (someone interested in joining the IWG community), you share a few details about what makes this space so amazing for your customers and encourage them to join the network soon so they can participate in next week’s networking event – then you head back to finish putting up your posters.



The day is coming to a close. Time to gently ask the large group in meeting room 3 to start wrapping up. You direct them to the nice restaurant you know around the corner, so they can grab a bite and continue their discussion. You ensure everything’s nice and tidy, it’s time to head home.

  



**About you**



We’re looking for someone who knows how to manage multiple tasks while providing customers with the best possible service. You also need to be:


* A good communicator, with the ability to build strong professional relationships and empathize with people’s needs (Ideally 1+ years of customer service experience)
* Happy taking ownership of problems and finding ways to solve them
* Positive, enthusiastic, and able to adapt to fast-changing situations
* Experience and confidence using MS Office and other basic IT equipment
* Legally eligible to work in the Country you are applying within and at least 18 years old

  



**What we offer**



On top of a competitive total compensation package, you’ll enjoy:


* Work life balance (no standard nights/weekends)
* Generous paid time off plans (sick and vacation)
* 11 Paid Company Holidays per calendar year (in addition to your PTO accrual)
* Competitive 401K Program, with a Company match

The area offers a low cost of living and provides many social, cultural, and recreational options, including parks, museums, festivals, professional regional theater, and premier shopping venues. Syracuse and Central New York present a wide range of seasonal recreation and attractions ranging from water skiing and snow skiing, hiking in the Adirondacks, touring the historic sites, visiting wineries along the Finger Lakes, and biking on trails along the Erie Canal.
  

**EEO Statement**
Syracuse University is an equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution. The University prohibits discrimination and harassment based on race, color, creed, religion, sex, gender, national origin, citizenship, ethnicity, marital status, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression, veteran status, or any other status protected by applicable law to the extent prohibited by law. This nondiscrimination policy covers admissions, employment, and access to and treatment in University programs, services, and activities.
  

**Commitment to Supporting and Hiring Veterans**
Syracuse University has a long history of engaging veterans and the military-connected community through its educational programs, community outreach, and employment programs. After World War II, Syracuse University welcomed more than 10,000 returning veterans to our campus, and those veterans literally transformed Syracuse University into the national research institution it is today. The University’s contemporary commitment to veterans builds on this historical legacy, and extends to both class-leading initiatives focused on making an SU degree accessible and affordable to the post-9/11 generation of veterans, and also programs designed to position Syracuse University as the employer of choice for military veterans, members of the Guard and Reserve, and military family members.
  

**Commitment to a Diverse and Inclusive Campus Community**
Syracuse University maintains an inclusive learning environment in which students, faculty, administrators, staff, curriculum, social activities, governance, and all other aspects of campus life reflect a diverse, multi-cultural, and international worldview. The University community recognizes and values the many similarities and differences among individuals and groups. At Syracuse, we are committed to preparing students to understand, live among, appreciate, and work in an inherently diverse country and world made up of people with different ethnic and racial backgrounds, military backgrounds, religious beliefs, socio-economic status, cultural traditions, abilities, sexual orientations and gender identities. To do so, we commit ourselves to promoting a community that celebrates and models the principles of diversity and inclusivity.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Syracuse-University","https://www.syr.edu","900 South Crouse Ave.

Families come in all shapes and sizes. And that includes the Wendy’s family - the people you work with as a Wendy’s Shift Leader.  


The stuff you want - like fun people, quality food, and a paycheck - done. Our founder Dave Thomas had three rules for everyone who works here: Do the right thing. Treat people with respect. Make food better than they’d expect from a fast food place. No doubt you do the first two already. We can teach you the third!  


Sound good? Keep reading.  


**Making things happen is just one of your talents:**  

* If a Wendy’s restaurant was a person, it’d be you: fun, fast, friendly and never out of bacon.
  
* Whatever comes up with a customer - good or bad - you handle it like a boss (‘cuz you wanna be a boss someday soon).
  
* You get how things work here, and make sure new team members know it, too.
  
* You make sure food safety standards and procedures are on point.

  

**What you bring to the table:**  

* At least one year of restaurant work experience.
  
* High school diploma or GED. (Some college or military experience? Tell us that, too.)
  
* You’ve already led, managed and organized a team in a fast-paced environment.
  
* Mad skills in problem solving, customer service and decision making.
  
* Giving and taking direction like a pro.
  
* Flexible work availability.

  

**You must be willing and able to:**  

* Travel to other Wendy’s locations (restaurants, area office, etc.) as needed.
  
* Stand and move for most - if not all - of your shift.
  
* Lift up to 25-50 lbs. now and then.
  
* Handle weather-related moments like rain at the drive-thru, taking trash out in the summer, etc.
  
* Wear a headset, use other restaurant equipment such as a register or grill, and follow brand standards and guidelines.
