 **Responsibilities**  

Details of Research Project:


The Bernstein lab is seeking to hire a highly skilled scientist to elucidate the role of chromatin remodelers in cancer. In particular, ATRX deletions drive a unique transcriptional program that promotes silencing of neuronal differentiation genes through altered genomic binding and novel protein partners.To tease apart what drives altered ATRX binding, what effect that has on transcription and cell fate, and what novel binding partners exist for ATRX IFFs, isogenic model systems have been created that the candidate will study. These models are crucial in determining changes to the epigenome and transcription that are directly related to the in-frame fusion of ATRX in found in neuroblastoma.


Technical Duties:


The ideal candidate will have expertise in the following (or similar) experimental strategies: protein biochemistry, cell culture and gene editing (e.g., CRISPR), cell-based phenotypic assays, chromatin assays & analyses (e.g. ChIP, CUT&RUN, ATAC-seq) in the context of cancer biology. The candidate’s anticipated duties will include a wide range of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) approaches, the ability to produce and handle large data sets and navigate public cancer databases. As senior Postdoc in the lab, the candidate is also expected to train students and/or other incoming lab members, contribute to grant writing and assist the PI with further administrative duties (*e.g.* seminar organization).Candidate will be expected to apply for postdoctoral fellowships and publish impactful papers.

 **Qualifications**  

Educational and other Requirements for the position:


A PhD in molecular biology, cancer biology or biochemistry is required, as well as 3-5 years of post-doctoral experience in the field of cancer epigenetics or similar. The successful candidate will have a strong publication record, including at least one first-author publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

The ideal candidate will have the ability to think deeply about a problem and test it experimentally, demonstrate strong verbal and written communication skills, exhibit strong time management skills, and be a collaborative team player.

  

Goals/Outcomes of the Research Project:


The candidate is expected to produce novel and significant research that will expand our understanding of the molecular mechanisms linking chromatin remodelers and transcription factors and how this impacts cancer establishment and/or progression. Impactful preliminary results will be used to apply to different funding agencies and will be ultimately collected in a high-impact publication.
