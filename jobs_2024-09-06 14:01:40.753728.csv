**POSITION SUMMARY**

  



Our jobs aren’t just about serving guests during a banquet or event. Instead, we want to build an experience that is memorable and unique. Our Guest Event Experts are skilled in a wide range of event functions with responsibility for making sure the event is well-executed from start to finish. Whether setting up or breaking down the materials, transporting supplies, taking orders, interacting with guests, or anything in between, the Guest Event Expert makes transactions feel like part of the experience.

  



No matter what position you are in, there are a few things that are critical to success – creating a safe work place, following company policies and procedures, upholding quality standards, and ensuring your uniform, personal appearance, and communications are professional. Guest Service Experts will be on their feet and moving around (stand, sit, or walk for an extended time) and taking a hands-on approach to work (move, lift, carry, push, pull, and place objects weighing less than or equal to 25 pounds without assistance). Doing all these things well (and other reasonable job duties as requested) is critical for Guest Event Experts – to get it right for our guests and our business each and every time.
