**Three-piece suits. Cold calls in a cubicle. Lone wolves.****Nope. Not here.**  
At Terminix Nation, we view sales as the natural result of building strong relationships and solving customers’ problems. If you’re nodding your head right now, we’d love to meet you.  
Our sales team is the engine that keeps Terminix running. And we reward the team accordingly with a competitive salary and benefits — including medical, dental, vision, a 401(k) with company match, and more. There are also opportunities to get trained, gain new skills, and build an awesome career.

But first things first. When you start in sales at Terminix Nation, you’ll get down and dirty. You’ll learn how to inspect and identify infestations (or conditions conducive to infestations) of all kinds of organisms, insects, birds, or other pests. Sounds awesome, right? You’ll learn all about what we do and how you can make your clients’ homes safer and their lives better. Once you know that, you’ll turn your talents to proposals and presentations that result in sales.

**As a Residential Sales Professional, here’s what you can expect** 

* You won’t be tied to a desk. You’ll be out and about — mobile, independent, and growing your career on your own terms. You’ll be the face of Terminix to your local community (with the backing of a national brand), and your clients will count on you to protect their homes and their families.
* When you first join Terminix Nation, you’ll spend a few months in training. Once you’ve got that and some state required licenses and certificates under your belt, you’ll take the lead with your own customers.
* You’ll get rewarded with competitive pay and robust benefits to cover you and your family. As a teammate, you will be eligible for a 401(k) with company match, company-paid life insurance, tuition reimbursement, and a generous student loan repayment program. You put in the work, and you’ll reap the rewards.
* You’ll be part of a community – bonus points if you’re already a leader in yours. Our bonds are strong at Terminix Nation and the relationships we develop in the communities we serve are unparalleled. Our teammates give back through volunteering, donations, scholarships, and more.
* You’ll be onboarded and trained by the best of ’em. You’ll get paid to get licensed, something you’ll have for a lifetime. You’ll know how to bust bugs at home, too.

**What your days will look like**

* Hit the books with training modules and hit the streets with on-the-job training with your teammates. You’ll learn product knowledge and sales techniques for selling the full suite of Terminix products. We’ll train and support you through state licensing and other company requirements.
* You’ll inspect and assess pest problems with precision and suggest Terminix solutions following company policy and pricing instructions.
* You must be obsessed with the customer’s experience — delivering exceptional service, following up to ensure satisfaction, and thinking creatively about how to grow the relationship. And if an account is delinquent, you’ll need to handle that with grace and effectiveness, too.
* Of course, you’ve got to like to sell solutions to problems. You will be expected to meet and greet potential customers to generate new business for the branch.
* There’s an opportunity to grow into a role you’re passionate about and fits your skillset — whether that’s management or another opportunity at Terminix.

**Some non-negotiables**  
There are some things you’ll just need to have or know to join Terminix Nation as a Residential Sales Professional.

* A high school education or GED.
* A valid driver’s license from your current state of residence.
* Strong social, customer service, and communication skills — in fact, we’d be really impressed if you came to this role with related experience and/or training in sales.
* Some basic math skills — add, subtract, multiply, and divide in all units of measure, using whole numbers, common fractions, and decimals. You’ll need to be able to follow instructions for mixing on product labels.

**Straight talk about the physical demands of our work**  
We’re not going to sugarcoat it. The essential functions of this job have some physical demands (of course, reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the essential functions.) Here’s what we mean:

* You’ve got to be able to move up to 10 lbs. regularly and 11–20 lbs. frequently, whether that’s lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, or otherwise repositioning objects.
* You’ll move around a lot — regularly sitting, climbing, balancing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, and crawling. You’ll go up and down stairs, ladders, scaffolding, ramps, and poles. And you’ll need to keep your balance when walking, standing, or crouching on narrow, slippery, or moving surfaces. (You’ll definitely get your steps in.)
* You must be able to safely operate a motor vehicle and make sure it and all other equipment is kept clean.
* The vision to perform detail-oriented activities at distances close to the eyes or within arm’s reach.
* Sometimes you’ll need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE), like an OSHA-compliant respirator, and you’ll need to be okay with regularly working in confined spaces, narrow aisles, or passageways (you know, where critters live).

**Three-piece suits. Cold calls in a cubicle. Lone wolves.****Nope. Not here.**  
At Terminix Nation, we view sales as the natural result of building strong relationships and solving customers’ problems. If you’re nodding your head right now, we’d love to meet you.  
Our sales team is the engine that keeps Terminix running. And we reward the team accordingly with a competitive salary and benefits — including medical, dental, vision, a 401(k) with company match, and more. There are also opportunities to get trained, gain new skills, and build an awesome career.

But first things first. When you start in sales at Terminix Nation, you’ll get down and dirty. You’ll learn how to inspect and identify infestations (or conditions conducive to infestations) of all kinds of organisms, insects, birds, or other pests. Sounds awesome, right? You’ll learn all about what we do and how you can make your clients’ homes safer and their lives better. Once you know that, you’ll turn your talents to proposals and presentations that result in sales.

**As a Residential Sales Professional, here’s what you can expect** 

* You won’t be tied to a desk. You’ll be out and about — mobile, independent, and growing your career on your own terms. You’ll be the face of Terminix to your local community (with the backing of a national brand), and your clients will count on you to protect their homes and their families.
* When you first join Terminix Nation, you’ll spend a few months in training. Once you’ve got that and some state required licenses and certificates under your belt, you’ll take the lead with your own customers.
* You’ll get rewarded with competitive pay and robust benefits to cover you and your family. As a teammate, you will be eligible for a 401(k) with company match, company-paid life insurance, tuition reimbursement, and a generous student loan repayment program. You put in the work, and you’ll reap the rewards.
* You’ll be part of a community – bonus points if you’re already a leader in yours. Our bonds are strong at Terminix Nation and the relationships we develop in the communities we serve are unparalleled. Our teammates give back through volunteering, donations, scholarships, and more.
* You’ll be onboarded and trained by the best of ’em. You’ll get paid to get licensed, something you’ll have for a lifetime. You’ll know how to bust bugs at home, too.

**What your days will look like**

* Hit the books with training modules and hit the streets with on-the-job training with your teammates. You’ll learn product knowledge and sales techniques for selling the full suite of Terminix products. We’ll train and support you through state licensing and other company requirements.
* You’ll inspect and assess pest problems with precision and suggest Terminix solutions following company policy and pricing instructions.
* You must be obsessed with the customer’s experience — delivering exceptional service, following up to ensure satisfaction, and thinking creatively about how to grow the relationship. And if an account is delinquent, you’ll need to handle that with grace and effectiveness, too.
* Of course, you’ve got to like to sell solutions to problems. You will be expected to meet and greet potential customers to generate new business for the branch.
* There’s an opportunity to grow into a role you’re passionate about and fits your skillset — whether that’s management or another opportunity at Terminix.

**Some non-negotiables**  
There are some things you’ll just need to have or know to join Terminix Nation as a Residential Sales Professional.

* A high school education or GED.
* A valid driver’s license from your current state of residence.
* Strong social, customer service, and communication skills — in fact, we’d be really impressed if you came to this role with related experience and/or training in sales.
* Some basic math skills — add, subtract, multiply, and divide in all units of measure, using whole numbers, common fractions, and decimals. You’ll need to be able to follow instructions for mixing on product labels.

**Straight talk about the physical demands of our work**  
We’re not going to sugarcoat it. The essential functions of this job have some physical demands (of course, reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the essential functions.) Here’s what we mean:

* You’ve got to be able to move up to 10 lbs. regularly and 11–20 lbs. frequently, whether that’s lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, or otherwise repositioning objects.
* You’ll move around a lot — regularly sitting, climbing, balancing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, and crawling. You’ll go up and down stairs, ladders, scaffolding, ramps, and poles. And you’ll need to keep your balance when walking, standing, or crouching on narrow, slippery, or moving surfaces. (You’ll definitely get your steps in.)
* You must be able to safely operate a motor vehicle and make sure it and all other equipment is kept clean.
* The vision to perform detail-oriented activities at distances close to the eyes or within arm’s reach.
* Sometimes you’ll need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE), like an OSHA-compliant respirator, and you’ll need to be okay with regularly working in confined spaces, narrow aisles, or passageways (you know, where critters live).

Postdoctoral Research Associate  

Curator Plant Genomics**Position Summary****:**
-------------------------

  

A postdoctoral research associate is sought to help investigate the evolution and development of sporangia in ferns as part of an NSF funded collaborative proposal. The postdoctoral research associate will report to Barbara Ambrose, Curator of Plant Genomics and Director of the Laboratory of Integrative Biodiversity Research.  

The sporangium is the fundamental reproductive structure common to all land plants. The evolution and development of sporangia have been key to the reproductive success and diversity of land plants. The evolution of distinct sporangia evolved three times independently and was a necessary innovation for the evolution of the seed. The evolution of smaller sporangia with an effective dehiscence mechanism is key to the reproductive success of leptosporangiate ferns, the largest group of ferns. Therefore, elucidating a core sporangia developmental network will provide insights into not only the reproductive structure common to all land plants but also the evolution and development of structures that are key to agriculture. Despite its fundamental importance, a comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary developmental genetics of the reproductive transition and concomitant sporangia development across land plants is lacking. This project will leverage the unique advantages of the model fern Ceratopteris with a combination of established and emerging technologies to address this major knowledge gap. This project will use a multi-pronged approach combining analyses of candidate gene evolution with phylogenetic, expression, and functional analyses as well as discovering new genes and the genetic network in the model fern Ceratopteris using in situ transcriptomics and LCM RNAseq. In addition, living collections will be leveraged to study the morphological diversity of reproductive structures across ferns. This collaborative project brings together unique skill sets from botany and developmental genetics to plant biotechnology. This project will further develop Ceratopteris as a model species for plant biology studies.  

  

Additionally, this position supports, through actions and conduct, NYBG’s Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Accessibility initiatives and helps to build and maintain an inclusive organization culture throughout the institution.**Specific Duties & Responsibilities****:**
-------------------------------------------

  

* Lead phylogenetic analyses of candidate genes of sporangia development.
* Lead expression analyses of candidate genes.
* Lead and coordinate functional analyses in *Ceratopteris richardii*.
* Train and supervise undergraduate and high school interns working on functional analyses and Fern Cell Atlas.
* Participate in training of PhD student in phylogenetic analyses, expression, and/or functional analyses.
* Lead manuscript preparation for specific aspects of project and collaborate with external PI and students on additional manuscripts.
* Engage in a collaborative postdoctoral mentoring plan.
* Present research to professionals and the public through a range of media.
* Participate in NYBG science activities and outreach related to the project.
**Qualifications****:**
-----------------------

* PhD in Biology, Botany, or Evolutionary Biology.
* Experience with molecular and/or developmental biology laboratory skills.
* Experience with phylogenetic analyses and bioinformatic pipelines preferred.
* Experience with microscopy preferred.
* Experience with expression analyses preferred.
* Experience with functional and morphological analyses preferred.
* Track record of collaborative work and publishing.

  

  

**Physical Demands & Work Environment:**

**Three-piece suits. Cold calls in a cubicle. Lone wolves.****Nope. Not here.**  
At Terminix Nation, we view sales as the natural result of building strong relationships and solving customers’ problems. If you’re nodding your head right now, we’d love to meet you.  
Our sales team is the engine that keeps Terminix running. And we reward the team accordingly with a competitive salary and benefits — including medical, dental, vision, a 401(k) with company match, and more. There are also opportunities to get trained, gain new skills, and build an awesome career.

But first things first. When you start in sales at Terminix Nation, you’ll get down and dirty. You’ll learn how to inspect and identify infestations (or conditions conducive to infestations) of all kinds of organisms, insects, birds, or other pests. Sounds awesome, right? You’ll learn all about what we do and how you can make your clients’ homes safer and their lives better. Once you know that, you’ll turn your talents to proposals and presentations that result in sales.

**As a Residential Sales Professional, here’s what you can expect** 

* You won’t be tied to a desk. You’ll be out and about — mobile, independent, and growing your career on your own terms. You’ll be the face of Terminix to your local community (with the backing of a national brand), and your clients will count on you to protect their homes and their families.
* When you first join Terminix Nation, you’ll spend a few months in training. Once you’ve got that and some state required licenses and certificates under your belt, you’ll take the lead with your own customers.
* You’ll get rewarded with competitive pay and robust benefits to cover you and your family. As a teammate, you will be eligible for a 401(k) with company match, company-paid life insurance, tuition reimbursement, and a generous student loan repayment program. You put in the work, and you’ll reap the rewards.
* You’ll be part of a community – bonus points if you’re already a leader in yours. Our bonds are strong at Terminix Nation and the relationships we develop in the communities we serve are unparalleled. Our teammates give back through volunteering, donations, scholarships, and more.
* You’ll be onboarded and trained by the best of ’em. You’ll get paid to get licensed, something you’ll have for a lifetime. You’ll know how to bust bugs at home, too.

**What your days will look like**

* Hit the books with training modules and hit the streets with on-the-job training with your teammates. You’ll learn product knowledge and sales techniques for selling the full suite of Terminix products. We’ll train and support you through state licensing and other company requirements.
* You’ll inspect and assess pest problems with precision and suggest Terminix solutions following company policy and pricing instructions.
* You must be obsessed with the customer’s experience — delivering exceptional service, following up to ensure satisfaction, and thinking creatively about how to grow the relationship. And if an account is delinquent, you’ll need to handle that with grace and effectiveness, too.
* Of course, you’ve got to like to sell solutions to problems. You will be expected to meet and greet potential customers to generate new business for the branch.
* There’s an opportunity to grow into a role you’re passionate about and fits your skillset — whether that’s management or another opportunity at Terminix.

**Some non-negotiables**  
There are some things you’ll just need to have or know to join Terminix Nation as a Residential Sales Professional.

* A high school education or GED.
* A valid driver’s license from your current state of residence.
* Strong social, customer service, and communication skills — in fact, we’d be really impressed if you came to this role with related experience and/or training in sales.
* Some basic math skills — add, subtract, multiply, and divide in all units of measure, using whole numbers, common fractions, and decimals. You’ll need to be able to follow instructions for mixing on product labels.

**Straight talk about the physical demands of our work**  
We’re not going to sugarcoat it. The essential functions of this job have some physical demands (of course, reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the essential functions.) Here’s what we mean:

* You’ve got to be able to move up to 10 lbs. regularly and 11–20 lbs. frequently, whether that’s lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, or otherwise repositioning objects.
* You’ll move around a lot — regularly sitting, climbing, balancing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, and crawling. You’ll go up and down stairs, ladders, scaffolding, ramps, and poles. And you’ll need to keep your balance when walking, standing, or crouching on narrow, slippery, or moving surfaces. (You’ll definitely get your steps in.)
* You must be able to safely operate a motor vehicle and make sure it and all other equipment is kept clean.
* The vision to perform detail-oriented activities at distances close to the eyes or within arm’s reach.
* Sometimes you’ll need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE), like an OSHA-compliant respirator, and you’ll need to be okay with regularly working in confined spaces, narrow aisles, or passageways (you know, where critters live).

Do you have a passion for editing and student mentorship? Vanguard College Prep is looking for Essay Coaches with strong communication and editing skills who can empower high school seniors working on the essay component of their college applications.

**As an Essay Coach, you will be expected to:**


* Provide dynamic one-on-one instruction to high school students on their college essays.
* Work on a project basis, shepherding students through the entire college essay writing process, including the narrative and all supplemental essays.
* Facilitate the writing process and provide in-depth feedback on essay drafts, conducting any necessary ad-hoc work along the way.
* Model professionalism and strong organizational skills by managing students' production schedules, replying to students in a timely manner, holding students accountable for all assignments, and tracking/logging hours worked.
* Mentor aspiring college students with empathy and an innate understanding that the college application process is becoming increasingly competitive and stressful.

  

  

**Requirements:**


* Bachelor's or graduate degree from a **Top 20 U.S. University.**
* Strong editing skills and mastery of the English language.
* Flexible schedule and a willingness to work with the students' schedules (will often include evenings and weekends), especially during the busy season of August-December.
* Access to a reliable internet connection and a workspace with minimal noise/distraction.

  

  

**The ideal candidate will also possess some or all of the following:**


* A degree in a communication-based field (English, Language Arts, Journalism, Creative Writing, Publishing, Anthropology, Public Policy, etc.)
* Experience tutoring high school and/or college-aged students in writing.
* Editing experience, especially in positions that require heavy editing to meet organizational standards.
* Experience in the college preparation service industry and/or college admissions.
* Experience teaching remotely, using tools such as Google Hangout, Google Drive, and Google Classroom.
* Strong organizational skills and the ability to multitask, balance multiple deadlines, and take responsibility for students' progress.
* A dynamic and outgoing personality!

  

  

**Why you want to be an Essay Specialist with Vanguard College Prep:**


* Paid training and professional development, including paid prep work and staff meetings.
* Distinctive and individualized approach to college preparation with a strong track record of producing top-tier students and nationally-ranked test scores.
* Elite team of instructors, counselors, and specialists from Ivy League and top universities across the nation who are passionate about fostering student success.
* Quickly growing start-up environment that emphasizes creativity, collaboration, and mentorship.

  

  

**Compensation:**


* Starting Pay: **$18.00 – $22.00** per hour depending on education, experience, and skill.
* Hourly rate applies to student sessions, as well as all prep work, editing, professional development, backend projects, and staff meetings. ***You are paid for every minute you work!***

  

  

**About Vanguard College Prep:**Vanguard College Prep is a full-service educational company whose mission is to enable the future leaders of our globalized world to meet their fullest potential. Through its test prep, college counseling, and college essay services, Vanguard is committed to providing meaningful, all-encompassing college preparation that treats each student as an individual, preparing them for the boardroom, not the assembly line.  

  

Two things set Vanguard apart from other after-school companies: our elite team and our personalized, organic curriculum. Unlike other college admissions companies, which often take a one-size-fits-all approach, Vanguard recognizes that every student learns differently. Our experienced instructors, counselors, and essay specialists strive to shatter this assembly line model by providing in-depth, long-term, and personalized instruction tailored to fit each student's individual needs. We encourage students' continual questioning and curiosity with the goal of extending learning beyond the classroom so that our students will be successful in the elite college of their choice and beyond.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Vanguard-College-Prep","http://www.vanguardcp.com","2785 Rockbrook Dr.
