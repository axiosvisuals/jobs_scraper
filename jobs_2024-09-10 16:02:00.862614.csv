We are a community committed to learning and growth, humility and grace, transparency and accountability. We believe in a collective responsibility to create a culture of belonging for all people within our organization – one that respects and embraces difference; treats everyone equitably; and empowers our colleagues to do the best work possible. We are as committed to anti-oppression, anti-ableism, and anti-racism internally as we are externally.

EliseAI develops cutting-edge conversational AI technology for industries fundamental to our lives: housing and healthcare. Everything is built on the foundation of health and home. Broken systems or ineffective processes in these domains have a disproportionate impact on our quality of life and society's overall wellbeing. Conversely, any solution or technology that solves problems in these areas will have an impact that ripples far beyond them. That's the only kind of impact we are interested in having at EliseAI. If you get excited by the thought of working really hard on these kinds of problems, then EliseAI is the right place for you.


**About the role**



You will be the second member of the company's legal department, reporting to the Head of Legal, and will play a key role in supporting all legal matters for the company. We are looking for someone eager to learn about the legal functions and operations of a rapidly-growing SaaS company and the legal challenges unique to the AI space.



In this role, you will be responsible for tracking and triaging a large number of projects at any given time. We are seeking a candidate who is equally comfortable prioritizing velocity or meticulous attention to detail, as circumstances merit, and who possesses a strong instinct for how to effectively balance these competing priorities.



The ideal candidate can excel in diverse working environments—whether that means following detailed guidance or taking initiative on large, open-ended projects. This role will touch on a variety of legal areas, from traditional commercial work to compliance/product-related projects, so we're also looking for someone who can learn quickly and views new challenges with excitement rather than intimidation.



If you're excited by the opportunity to contribute to the success of a growing company with a cutting-edge product, we'd love to hear from you!


**Please note, this role is in person at EliseAI's NYC headquarters (33rd and Park) ~4 days a week. We are not considering remote candidates for this position.**


**Responsibilities may include:**


*Contracting/Commercial:*


* Assisting with the drafting and negotiation of complex customer, partner, vendor, and other contracts
* Helping to establish contracting and organizational processes that will allow us to move with greater efficiency as we continue to scale


*Regulatory/Compliance:*


* Owning large, complex regulatory/compliance projects and driving them to completion
* Becoming a subject matter expert and trusted advisor on relevant regulatory regimes
* Tracking new and amended laws to ensure we remain compliant in an rapidly-changing legal landscape
* Developing and delivering training programs to company stakeholders to ensure compliance with policies and best practices


*Other:*


* Assisting with other legal matters, from HR to corporate governance
* Assisting with commercial and financial operational matters in close partnership with our Sales and Finance teams
* Speaking with customers to address their questions and concerns
* Taking on ad hoc projects in other areas across the business


**Requirements**


*Qualifications*


* Juris Doctor (JD) degree (or foreign equivalent) from a top law school
* Admitted to practice law in New York State with good standing, or willing and able to waive in to New York
* ~1-3 years of legal experience at a top firm, either involving diverse corporate work or substantial complex regulatory/compliance work in a relevant industry (preferably both)


*Skills*


* Ability to effectively and clearly communicate with customers and other outside parties
* Strong legal drafting skills
* Ability to parse and distill complex statutes and regulations
* Strong researcher–demonstrated ability to reliably and thoroughly source data/information, interpret such information and augment with necessary context, and provide actionable recommendations or guidance to decision makers
* Highly organized; rigorous attention to detail
* Sufficient mathematical aptitude and financial literacy to effectively partner with Sales and Finance


*Mindset*


* Comfortable both owning deadlines with minimal supervision and taking instruction/working in close partnership with others
* Enthusiastic, can-do approach; excited to work hard at a fast-growing startup
* Has a startup mindset, strong sense of ownership, and a proper balance of quality and sense of urgency
* Wants to work in person at NYC headquarters (33rd and Park) ~4 days a week


**Why join**



Growth and impact. It's not often that you can get in on the ground floor of a funded (unicorn!) startup that's scaling. That means that instead of following a playbook, you'll be helping to write it. Every single day you will be challenged to identify how we can scale and execute on it. You'll learn what works when you succeed and what doesn't when you fail. Either way, the rest of the team will be here to support you.


**Benefits**



In addition to the growth and impact you'll have at EliseAI, we offer competitive salaries along with the following benefits:


* Equity in the company in the form of stock options
* Medical, Dental and Vision premiums covered at 100%
* Fully paid parental leave
* Commuter benefits
* 401k benefits
* Monthly fitness stipend
* Our brand new Midtown south office with an open floor plan, fully stocked kitchen, and company paid lunch
* Fun company social events through our Elise and the City program
* Unlimited vacation and paid holidays


We'll cover relocation packages from outside of the Greater NYC metro area - we'll make the move exciting, not painful.


**Job Compensation Range:**



The salary range for this role is $170,000 - $200,000. EliseAI offers a competitive total rewards package which includes base salary, equity, and a comprehensive benefits & perks package. Exact compensation inclusive of salary and any bonuses is determined based on a number of factors including experience and skill level, location and qualifications which are assessed during the interview process. Additional details about total compensation and benefits will be provided by our Recruiting Team during the hiring process. EliseAI provides equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants for employment and prohibits discrimination and harassment of any type without regard to race, color, religion, age, sex, national origin, disability status, genetics, protected veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state or local laws.

Are you looking for a opportunity where you can use your experience to propel your career into management? At New York Life, we will invest in you from the start to help you learn and grow as a financial professional first. We’ll train you in valuable skills, such as marketing, business development, and customer relationship management, and provide you with the tools you need to further your career. Then we’ll train you and provide you with access to the tools you need for a career in management.

**What we’re looking for**  
We’re looking for people who want to make a lasting impact on the financial well-being of individuals, families, and small businesses—motivated people who can answer yes to one of the following questions:

* Do you have sales or managerial experience in another industry?
* Have you previously run your own business?
* Do you have an MBA or other equivalent degree?

In the Accelerated Path to Management Program, you’ll start off as a financial professional, learning how to sell our products, building client relationships, and meeting specific requirements1 before transitioning into a management role.  
You’ll then undergo a six-month intensive training program designed to prime you for success as a manager. You will use that experience to understand how to recruit and coach others to success.

**What we offer**

**Your first year**  
You’ll learn firsthand about a financial professional’s role and day-to-day work by working as a financial professional for the first year of your career journey with New York Life. We will provide you with complete training, access to digital tools, and a comprehensive product suite.

**Training and resources**  
You will receive top-notch training that will give you an understanding and appreciation for the strength and value of  
New York Life. Beyond this training and support, New York Life will provide access to the resources you need to succeed day-to-day, including experts on hand to answer your questions and a suite of digital sales, prospecting and marketing tools that will help you attract and retain your clients with web, social and email content.

**Product Solutions**   
You will learn about our robust products and services that can help clients and their families achieve their financial goals.  
Together with its subsidiaries, New York Life provides a range of competitive insurance and financial products, including life insurance, annuities, long-term care insurance, disability income insurance, and investment products such as mutual funds through our broker-dealer, NYLIFE Securities LLC (member of FINRA and SIPC), a Licensed Insurance  
Agency. You will be required to hold securities licenses and FINRA registrations and affiliate with NYLIFE Securities as a registered representative before you can offer investment products.

**Your transition to a Field Manager role**  
After meeting specific requirements for the first 12 months as a financial professional, you will enter a specialized six-month Associate Partner training program. We’ll help you to lead and build your team of financial professionals.  
Throughout your career journey with New York Life, you’ll continue to have opportunities to grow and be promoted to increasingly senior levels of management.

**How we will compensate you**   
When you begin with New York Life as a financial professional2, you will receive income that is commission-based.3

If you meet the requirements and approvals to become an Associate Partner, you will receive a salary. The salary range for an Associate Partner is $60,000–$150,000 (in California, the salary range is $62,400–$150,000), plus you will be eligible for additional compensation related to the agents you recruit and develop (“R&Ds”). R&Ds are additional compensation that is designed to increase your income and to reimburse for any reasonable and necessary expenses we do not otherwise reimburse. You will also be eligible for medical, dental, and vision benefits, life, long-term disability, and accidental death and dismemberment coverages, a pension plan,4 and a 401(k) savings plan.5

New York Life will value and reward your hard work and success. You’ll have significant income potential over time, because our field managers’ compensation is directly aligned with their recruiting performance and the production level of their team of financial professionals. The average income among our 586 recruiters at all levels in 2021 was $270,890.6

2 If you qualify for an Introductory (PTAS) Contract, you will preview an agent career with New York Life as an independent contractor while continuing to work at your current job, with limited exceptions. During this preview period of up to six months, any sales you make will continue to accrue until you either make enough sales to become a full-time agent under a Training Allowance Subsidy (TAS) Contract or the passage of six months, whichever is earlier. If you do not become a full-time agent, all commissions on any sales you made will be paid to you at the end of six months. If you become a full- time agent under a TAS Contract, you will be credited with the commissions you accrued under the Introductory Contract.
