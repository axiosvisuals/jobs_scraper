Our Commercial Strategy and Marketing group creates and delivers human-centered experiences, where innovation meets customer-centricity, driving the ultimate experience for our patients. Our focus extends beyond transactions to craft experiences as one fully integrated, aligned and connected organization that puts empathy at the center, powered by insight and foresight.  


We develop an end-to-end approach to strategy, focusing on every touchpoint that impacts our customers. We leverage data and insights to inform our decision-making processes, ensuring that our strategies are rooted in a deep understanding of customer needs and behaviors. Our 'test and learn’ mindset and approach enables us to iterate rapidly and refine our strategies based on real-world results.

THE AGENCY  

The Department of City Planning (DCP) plans for the strategic growth and development of the City through ground-up planning with communities, the development of land use policies and zoning regulations applicable citywide, and sharing its perspectives on growth and community needs with sister agencies in collaboration with the Mayor’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  

  

DCP is a great place to work – cultivating intellectual inspiration, professional development, and creativity. Visit our website at www.nyc.gov/planning to access the full listing of job opportunities and to learn more about our great agency.  

  

THE CAPITAL PLANNING TEAM  

We’re working to foster better, more collaborative capital planning through robust data analytics, pro-active interagency coordination, and forward-looking planning for integrated needs of our neighborhoods across all five boroughs. We are responsible for providing integrated city planning perspectives into the City’s capital budget planning and decision-making processes.  

  

City agencies are planning to invest over $100 billion in New York City’s infrastructure and buildings over the next decade. The Capital Planning team is working to support strategic capital investment planning across City agencies by boosting the integrated collaboration and coordination across major capital agencies. Working in partnership with our borough offices, we ensure there is a common, informed set of planning inputs, and a neighborhood-focused lens applied consistently to crucial planning decisions.  

  

Our work spans the lifecycle of capital investment in New York City:  

* We inform capital budget priorities and guiding principles, jointly developing the City’s Ten-Year Capital Strategy with the Mayor’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and evaluating the impact that capital investments can have on neighborhoods and citywide planning priorities with close attention paid to growth and equity.
* We work alongside planners in DCP’s borough offices, strategic planning divisions, and the City’s capital agencies to shape specific projects in dynamic NYC neighborhoods, supporting project identification, scoping, prioritization and needs assessments for millions of dollars within the Strategy for Equity and Economic Development program.
* We partner with major capital agencies to ensure they have the robust set of forward-looking planning inputs they need to build capital programs that meet all neighborhood needs of tomorrow.
* We analyze the budget to help drive more strategic and equitable investment.
* We help assess and plan the City’s needs for service and operational facilities in the medium-term, seeking opportunities to take advantage of the broader City portfolio and supportive private investment.
* We foster the use of modern technology tools to inform integrated capital planning decisions, evolving intuitive web applications like the NYC Capital Planning Explorer their underlying data products to promote transparency and widespread collaboration in the capital planning process.


  

THE ROLE  

The Assistant Director of Neighborhood Capital Planning is responsible for leading a team that will integrate relevant planning perspectives into the Department and City’s neighborhood capital plans. The Assistant Director will understand neighborhood needs through DCP’s borough office planners and, work to manage the integration of capital projects that address those needs into forward-looking capital investments. The Assistant Director will also work closely with the Office of Management and Budget to track expenditures and commitments related to neighborhood plans and ensure that a robust, data-focused process is followed.  

  

The person in this role should be a visionary planning ambassador who fosters interagency collaboration, excels at change management, and has a strong interest in advancing data-driven planning analyses to better inform decision-making. This candidate should have exposure to capital planning and budget-making, infrastructure and facility planning, and ideally has had prior experience working with multiple government agencies in the City of New York.  

  

The Assistant Director of Neighborhood Capital Planning will be passionate about city planning, improving the quality of life in all New York City neighborhoods, and advancing the adoption of new processes and technologies in city planning and government. The candidate will have a proven track record of influencing interdisciplinary teams and will demonstrate extensive experience in building lasting partnerships inside and outside the Agency to extend the team’s reach.  

  

The outcomes that the Director of Capital Planning will influence include:  

* Ongoing support for DCP borough offices engaged in neighborhood planning to ensure holistic planning efforts include needs assessment of capital facilities, public engagement around needs and involvement of partner agencies to support public discussion, project scope development and implementation of capital needs;
* The approval of and allocation of capital funding for new and improved parks, streets, community facilities, utilities, and other public investments in neighborhoods that are the subject of comprehensive community planning efforts and rezonings through the Strategy for Equity and Economic Development;

**About the Organization**  

The Empirical Studies of Conflict (ESOC) is a multi-campus, interdisciplinary network of scholars engaged in research on politically motivated and organized criminal violence worldwide. The Bridging Divides Initiative (BDI), a program within ESOC, is a non-partisan research initiative that tracks and mitigates political violence in the United States. BDI supports efforts to grow and build local community resilience through elections and other periods of heightened risk, laying the groundwork for longer-term to bridge the divides we face as a nation. It does this by 1) producing action-oriented and responsive research to fill existing gaps and empower local leaders; 2) enabling cross-sector collaboration, so individuals and organizations are better prepared to mitigate risk and respond to crisis when it does arise; and 3) helping to drive the policy and community response. Over the past four years, BDI played an essential role in supporting a wide range of actors preparing for and responding to political violence and democratic crisis. Our data, analysis, and tools continue to help a diverse coalition of national and local decision-makers better target their interventions. BDI is based at the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs (SPIA), co-hosted by the Empirical Studies of Conflict (ESOC).

StaffCo is a Professional Employer Organization, commonly referred to as a PEO, duly organized and registered under the New York Professional Employer Organization law. StaffCo and SUNY have entered into a professional employer agreement under which StaffCo is the employer of Stony Brook Clinical Practice Management Plan employees and responsible for all aspects of employment, including hirings, promotions, disciplines, terminations, the day-to-day direction and supervision of work, as well as labor relations and collective bargaining. StaffCo is fully responsible for providing all payroll and human resources services, including the payment of wages, collecting and reporting payroll taxes and maintaining any and all employee benefits. SUNY Stony Brook Hospital is responsible for the operation of the hospital and provision of health care and is the co-employer as is necessary to conduct its responsibilities and for related licensure, regulatory or statutory requirements and obligations.

  

Given StaffCo’s employment responsibilities, it is deemed the “employer” for employment and labor law purposes. Thus, the employees are private sector employees of StaffCo, not public sector employees of SUNY. The private sector nature of the StaffCo employees has been approved by NYS Civil Service and upheld in a decision by the US National Labor Relations Board.
