**Who We Are**   
LA Bikini is at the forefront of a generational shift in the way beautiful skin is achieved.

We’ve cast aside the methods of the past, namely hot wax, in favor of a more modern, more comfortable technique called “sugaring.” Simply put, it’s the removal of unwanted body hair by applying a proprietary sugar paste that goes on cool, comes off easily, and leaves skin unbelievably smooth. So smooth we call it, “The New Smooth.”

**What We Are Looking For**  
A highly motivated and confident individual who believes there's no higher calling than helping clients feel good about themselves. A friendly, easy-going person who excels at being a team player, yet feels equally at home in an environment where individual achievement is highly valued. Someone who believes that lofty goals are attainable and co-workers are worthy of enthusiastic support and encouragement. And, most of all, someone who not only loves the beauty industry, but is particularly psyched about the art and science of hair removal.

**What We Provide**  
A career at LA Bikini is, of course, a two-way street. We expect a lot from you, but we also have a lot to offer you in return. (Okay, so maybe we offer a tad bit more than we ask, but for the right individual, that's totally okay with us.)

For openers, we provide something that's increasingly rare these days: A great workplace where people have respect for one another. Talk about priceless. Add to that the chance to earn good money (and by ""good,"" we mean well above the national average) and there's an excellent chance you'll want to stick around for the long haul. (Just think of the money you'll save on resumes down the road.)

And with a smaller staff comprised of like-minded achievers driven to excel understand why so many talented, motivated people have decided to call LA Bikini home – their low-key, low-stress home.

Sir Isaac Newton said that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Which is exactly how things work at LA Bikini. If you work hard for us, we'll work hard for you.

**Requirements**

* A license in Cosmetology or Esthetics
* Strong written and verbal communication skills
* A knack for organizing (with a keen eye for detail)
* Retail or product sales experience
* A flair for technology
* Strong people skills
* A passion for skincare

Job Types: Full-time, Part-time

Pay: $16.00 - $35.00 per hour

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/U--haul","http://www.uhaul.com/","2727 North Central Avenue

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/U--haul","http://www.uhaul.com/","2727 North Central Avenue
