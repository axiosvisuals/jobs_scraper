From bold beginnings in 1869, our New York-based nonprofit has supported hundreds of thousands of our neighbors on their own paths to stability, strength, and independence. We help children and families navigate through and beyond foster care. We help families struggling with conflict and poverty grow strong. We help individuals with developmental disabilities live their best lives, and we help our neighbors access quality health and mental health services—core to building lifelong resilience and wellbeing. Together, our interrelated programs provide a whole-person, whole-family, and whole-life approach that unlocks solutions for a lifetime.

Under the direct supervision of the Coordinator of Individual and Person Centered Services the Job Coach will be  
respsonsible for the following;  
Job coaching refers to the training of an employee who is learning the skills of a new profession. A job coach  
will use structured intervention techniques to help the employee learn to perform job tasks to the employer's  
specifications and to learn the interpersonal skills necessary to be accepted as a worker at the job site and in  
related community contacts. [Job coaching can also include related assessment, job development, counseling,  
advocacy, travel training and other services needed to maintain the employment

Responsibilities:

The New York Foundling is committed to attracting and retaining a diverse employee population, the Foundling will honor your experiences, perspectives and unique identity. Together, our community strives to create and maintain working and learning environments that are inclusive, equitable and welcoming.

By placing an individual directly in a job with the hands-on assistance of a job coach, areas of vocational and  
personal strength and weakness become apparent early in the process. The job coach will cater their role to  
working on improving the weaknesses and highlighting the strengths of the individual as outlined in the  
individual work plan. With the job coach in place, the individual is able to receive immediate feedback,  
assistance, and follow-up from this support. The job coach will familiarize themself with the goals the individual  
is working on and track the frequency of which he coaches the individual on those goals on the data collection  
sheet daily.  
A job coach will encourage the individual to advocate for him/herself, but can advocate on their behalf if that is  
absolutely necessary. A job coach will essentially learn all skills required to do the job. When at a worksite, the  
job coach may have to prompt the individual on how to complete tasks, and if necessary model a task, but the job  
coach never completes tasks for the individual.

**\\*For this Account Manager role, we are searching for talent located in either the Jersey City, NJ or New York City.\\***


Our people do far more than manage the sales lifecycle, they’re technical advisors who develop a deep understanding of customer needs and deliver creative solutions improving energy and water efficiency while optimizing customer profitability and productivity and protecting our natural resources. Our most successful people have related technical experience or formal education in a STEM concentration, a passion for environmental sustainability, and a consultative customer approach. Our Account Management Team also has access to excellent benefits and perks including:

Spend your days doing what you love with people that understand.

**Apply for our Content Creator position.** 

**YossiG Design** 

**Luxury Residential and Commercial Interior Design** 

**Where do you spend the best hours of your day?** 

Work in a place that values you for you. That understands that you’re more than just the sum total of your talent. That has your best interest at heart. That acknowledges your needs, wants, preferences and feelings. A place that knows that as much as you love being an employee, you love being a person. You want to grow. You want to succeed. You want to be seen. You want to become. YossiG understands that, and encourages it. Nothing will hinder your path to success. Nothing will stall your journey to greatness.

We won’t own you, we’ll just loan you.

That’s us. Now, what about you?

**We’re looking for a Content Creator:** 

We’re looking for someone that is steeped in the world of social media. Someone that has social media handles or content creation tucked firmly under their belt with lots of room for more to join. Someone who understands that a brand is way more than a logo and creates strategies on how to bring the brand to life. Someone who sees the details in everything and absolutely loves getting creative. Someone who can switch off from filming to photoshop to caption creation like it’s nobody’s business. Someone who loves to work independently but also thrives as a team player. Someone with the backbone to make big decisions and the knowledge to back it up. Someone that has an eye for aesthetics and understands interior design terms and trends. Someone that wants a career yet wants to be part of something bigger than themselves.

Someone with a strong past and an even stronger future.

If you crossed the line from starry eyed creative to established professional, reach out.

And don’t let our high expectations deter you.

We’re human too.

**Why does YossiG exist?** 

Our Mission is to design spaces that inspire the best in people.

**Our team is united by the following five core values:** 

All ears; no airs

Assume you know nothing. Take the time to listen, connect, and hear the unspoken. With no airs, it’s always people first.

Keep growing

Seek more—more skills, more knowledge, more growth. Challenge the status quo, reject mediocre, and never stop at good; push for great.

Sign your name.

Own it completely. Don’t just leave your mark, sign your name. Take responsibility, take initiative, take pride.

Surprise and delight

Dazzle by delivering the unexpected. Do that thing that will make eyes twinkle, smiles widen, and spirits soar.

See what others don’t

See around corners. Find solutions to problems clients didn’t know they had. Take the time to notice, innovate, and elevate.

Diáfano is the language learning hub of the future, with human-centered philosophy at its very core. The Diáfano Method fuses tried and true methods of language learning with our own modern spin.

We empower people to immerse themselves in new cultures and create meaningful connections through language learning.

Our goal is to help students achieve language mastery through methods focused on social learning. We rely on data to inform progress and our decision-making process, all while engaging in culturally-responsive pedagogy.

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/U--haul","http://www.uhaul.com/","2727 North Central Avenue
