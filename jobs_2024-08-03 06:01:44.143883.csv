We are the **Financial Strategy and Solutions Group** (FSG), a corporate finance advisory team in Citi’s investment banking division. We deliver rigorous, data-driven, and actionable strategic corporate finance advice to Citi’s corporate, financial institution, and public sector clients globally, drawing on our expertise across sectors, markets, and products. Our services help win new business by differentiating Citi from its competitors, and play a key role in deepening the firm’s relationship with many of its largest and most sophisticated clients.

As an analyst on our team, you will work on live client engagements where you will learn how to independently run our models, develop recommendations, and prepare client materials. You will work on teams with both junior and senior bankers, encounter companies in multiple sectors, and see a wide variety of our clients’ most critical financial and strategic challenges. You will also complete a summer-long team project where you create new analytical content for our advisory work. Throughout, you will have a ringside view of a world-class global investment bank coming together to serve its clients.

All HR Associates participate in a comprehensive training program in July and August.

Elsewhere is a multi-room Brooklyn music venue and nightclub built by and for the culture-obsessed, managed by our sister promotions company PopGun Presents – an events collective with deep roots in NYC's underground music community. We are here to empower artists, celebrate the diversity of our city, widen access to visionary and uplifting culture and experience the joy of doing it all together.

  

If you share our passion for music and art without boundaries, and you're looking for the challenge of your career, we want to connect with you - join us and grow with one of the best teams in independent arts, hospitality, events, and culture.

 **Job Description**

  

Elsewhere is looking for an open minded, attentive, and responsible busser for a seasonal position for our rooftop season.

  

This individual will be responsible for:

* Ensuring that the venue (indoors, outdoors, restrooms and floors) are clean and functional at all times
* Cleaning any spills in the venue (sweeping and mopping)
* Removing trash and recycling; replacing the garbage bags throughout the night
* Taking out the garbage during events and at the end of the night
* Pre-bussing, clearing, wiping tabletops, bar counters, green rooms backstage and seating areas
* Clearing bar counters, tables, and surfaces of dirty cups, napkins, beverages, etc.
* Working closely with barback captain throughout the night, ex: restocking the bar supplies, bar set up, retrieving ice for the bars, helping carry beer cases, water, etc.
* Responsible for regularly inspecting all venues for cleanliness (sweeping floors and emptying trash cans)
* Helping sort and organize bar and liquor orders during delivery day (one day per week)
* Supporting the barback team by cleaning up the bar counters at the end of the shift
* Performing basic cleaning & side work tasks as directed by barback captain and managers

 **You’ll be successful in this role if you….**

* Ability to work in a fast-paced, high volume environment
* Must be able to work weekends and late nights (Friday and Saturday) and occasionally holidays
* Ability to lift heavy items (up to 50 pounds)
* Have experience working in high volume settings such as nightclubs or music venues
* Are open minded to a diverse audience (straight, queer, trans, POC, any type of discrimination is unacceptable)

 **Compensation**


$20 per hour

 **Elsewhere’s Values**


These values are real and guide all of our decisions in how we operate and how we treat people. This includes our decisions to hire, reward, and fire. Every single person at Elsewhere will be held to these standards. This is how we build a great team, achieve our goals, and do so enjoyably.

 **INCLUSIVITY**


Elsewhere is a haven for our staff, artists, and audiences to experience the joy of expressing their authentic selves. Everybody has the right to feel welcomed and understood here, in direct defiance of all the ways our society tries to divide us up out there. We crave connectivity and togetherness. We’re curious about the unknown.

 **OPTIMISM**


The chills we get experiencing transcendent music in a crowd remind us that a better world is possible. Elsewhere is a celebration of that feeling - of joy, wonder, and hope. We are here to have fun, and we reject cynicism in all its forms.

 **RESPECT**


Our love for the game comes from a place of deep respect: for the extraordinary history of music and nightlife in NYC, for the working artists out there redefining culture, and for our staff who live and breathe it every night. To do right, we extend that respect to each other and everyone else along the journey.

 **KINDNESS**


Our job means service: to our teammates, artists, customers, community, city, and to the culture. We can’t do this without being kind to ourselves, to each other, to our artists, to our audiences, and to our community. Be understanding, empathetic, go out of your way to help people out, be friendly, generous, considerate. We celebrate individuality, but there is no place for selfishness or ego.

 **INTEGRITY**


We believe strong communities are built on trust, and so everyone must rely on us to be honest, transparent, and consistent. We live our values and stand by them even when it’s hard or inconvenient. We admit our mistakes and work to grow from them.

 **PASSION**


There are much easier ways to earn a living. The renewable resource that keeps our team sustained is an unshakable conviction in some aspect of our mission, whether it’s supporting new artists, helping audiences discover music, building community, or shifting culture.

 **EXCELLENCE**


To accomplish our goals we aim high, and work both hard and smart.

 **CREATIVITY**


The beauty of culture is that it is always evolving, and so should we. We value out-of- the-box thinking, challenging “the way things are,” and imaginative leaps. Like in art, it is better for us to fail trying something new than to not be experimenting in the first place.
