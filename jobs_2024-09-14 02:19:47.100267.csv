==========================



Jeremiah Program (JP) is a nonprofit organization helping single mothers invest in themselves so they can thrive and take steps towards economic mobility by partnering with them to access higher education, affordable childcare, housing, skills training and career development. JP envisions a world where poverty is no longer feminized; where race is not divorced from gender; where career and financial opportunities are not gentrified; and where women who experience poverty not only hold a seat at the table but hold the mic and curate the agenda.

  



Jeremiah Program offers one of the nation’s most successful strategies for disrupting poverty, two generations at a time. At JP, we believe that no mother should have to make the untenable choice between investing in herself or supporting her children. Our holistic approach invites single mothers into the leadership tent and encourages families to bring all of their identities to bear in achieving their goals in pursuit of economic mobility.

  



Founded in 1993, this year JP is supporting over 2,000 moms and kids across nine residential and non-residential campuses: Austin, Baltimore, Boston, Brooklyn, Fargo, Las Vegas, Minneapolis, St. Paul, and Rochester.

**About Us:**



Competitive triathletes and passionate bakers, Pam Weekes and Connie McDonald left their careers to open a small bread shop in New York City in 1995 — Levain Bakery.  

One day, they baked a BIG chocolate chip walnut cookie as energy for triathlon training. At Levain, a batch of these 6-ounce cookies flew off the shelves, and an icon was born. The cozy shop on West 74th Street became a neighborhood favorite and a destination for epicurious visitors from around the world, hungry for “the cookie.”  


From the start, Pam, Connie and team baked everything fresh on-site each day, donating the day’s leftovers to charity — and we still do, nearly 30 years later. Today, Levain has bakeries across the country (with more to come!), plus ecommerce gift boxes to treat cookie lovers in every state.  


Every day, we strive to embody our company’s five core values:
* Welcome All- *we are all in it together*
* Work Hard and Be Nice- *we go above and beyond*
* Lead with Heart- *we do the right thing*
* Rise Up- *we are proactive*

The WSJ Finance Reporting Fellowship is an opportunity for early-career journalists with an interest in covering financial markets or personal finance to spend 12 months in the New York newsroom as full-time members of the reporting staff.


The fellowship, offered in partnership with the National Association of Hispanic Journalists (NAHJ) and The City University of New York (CUNY) Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism, will provide hands-on experience, exposure, training and mentorship opportunities. Two journalists will be selected for the next session, which runs from January through December of 2024. One will be embedded with The Wall Street Journal’s Finance team, the other with the Personal Finance team on the Life & Work desk.


You should be a talented, ambitious and hard-working journalist with one to three years of journalism newsroom experience who has a curiosity about financial markets or about the ways people spend, save and invest. Dedication to high journalism standards and excellent writing and reporting skills are required. A demonstrated interest in business reporting is a plus, though prior business/finance reporting experience is not required.


The Wall Street Journal’s WSJ Finance Reporting Fellowships program is an outreach training program designed to help identify and develop journalists with diverse backgrounds who are interested in covering financial markets and personal finance.

The Journal has begun an ambitious expansion of its daily financial markets coverage, which incorporates news, data and analysis. Life & Work, a new coverage team at the Journal covers ways we spend money and time. Our expanding Personal Finance team delivers stories that help people navigate decisions and improve their lives.


After an orientation and training period, these fellows dive into the work of a Journal markets or personal finance reporter, learning as they go and growing their portfolios. Fellows work from the New York City newsroom at least three days a week and will participate in training sessions and other exercises to build their skills.


**HOW TO APPLY:**


Please submit a résumé and no more than five work samples representative of your best work.


In place of a cover letter, please also submit a memo responding to each of the following prompts:


* Describe why you are interested in reporting on money and markets. Feel free to share ways your work has touched on business, finance, the economy, or consumers and money. *(No more than 300 words)*
* What strengths would you bring to this fellowship role that you believe may complement the Journal's coverage? What skills would you like to gain? *(No more than 300 words)*
* At The Wall Street Journal, we provide facts, data and information, not assertions or opinions. Trust in our journalism is the currency we seek to earn with all we produce. Please discuss how your work reflects these values. *(No more than 300 words)*

The deadline to apply is Friday, Nov. 10, 2024 by 11:59 p.m. ET. Late or incomplete submissions will not be considered.


**TIMING:**


The fellowships start in January 2025 and run through December 2025, though dates can be flexible in certain circumstances.

Job Description  

The Books, Events, and Film/TV team is looking for an experienced project manager to support the team across the portfolio.

We’ve published two of five books (the third will be published this October) and have a development partnership (film, tv, exhibitions) with Lionsgate and Harpo Films (of which the 1619 doc series on Hulu was the first expression). At its core, the team is led by the project’s creator, Nikole Hannah-Jones, and the editors Caitlin Roper, Jake Silverstein, and Ilena Silverman.
This is a hybrid position based in New York City and includes regular attendance in the office each week per your departmental guidance.
Responsibilities:* Track deliverables and manage all communications with several stakeholders including New York Times leadership, the publishing team and our film/TV partners
* Maintain a master calendar of events and production timelines, proactively managing conflicting priorities
* Attend meetings and take notes, track and update action items and set up follow through
* Conduct ad-hoc research and competitive analysis on an individual project basis
* Asset management, e.g. pulling organizing images and text for book projects.
* Coordinate scheduling and travel booking, across the film, TV, publishing and events work
* Work on an archive of The 1619 Project and its impact since its launch in 2019
* Demonstrate support and understanding of our value of journalistic independence and a strong commitment to our mission to seek the truth and help people understand the world.
* You will report to Caitlin Roper, executive editorial director of Books, Film/TV and Events.


Basic Qualifications:* 2+ years of experience
* A background in publishing, journalism, events, film/tv (or a combination).
* Experience managing multiple stakeholders at once.
* Superb critical thinking and problem solving skills, with the ability to deliver and pivot quickly


Preferred Qualifications:* A passion for The 1619 Project and a thorough understanding of the ways transatlantic slavery has shaped the contemporary United States

**Role Description**

SMBC Group is seeking a Vice President for the Compliance Risk Assessment team (“CRA team”) within the Compliance Department Americas Division (""CPAD""), reporting to the Executive Director, Head of Risk and Control Assessment. As a Compliance Risk Assessment (“CRA”) Vice President, this role will assist in managing a comprehensive compliance risk assessment framework to ensure the applicable regulatory compliance risks and internal controls are identified and assessed to determine the risk profile for applicable laws/regulations as applicable to respective legal entities. Note: the CRA excludes financial crimes (AML, Sanctions, Fraud, and Bribery) risks as those risks are assessed under a separate program. In addition, this role will serve as program lead for establishing and maintaining Compliance’s own Risk and Control Self-Assessment (“RCSA”), a program managed by SMBC’s Operational Risk department in which Compliance participates. The role will manage one long-term external contractor and will be supported by additional members of the CRA team, who are assigned to support this role as needed.

  

The results of the CRA are utilized to drive monitoring and testing activities and to prioritize Compliance and other resources as new emergent risks are identified. This role will include conducting compliance risk assessments of certain U.S. legal entities in the role of subject matter expert (“SME”) as well as managing other SMEs outside of the CRA team in their conduct of compliance risk assessments for the legal entities they cover (primarily non-U.S. entities). The role requires leading workshops with 1st line of defense (“1LOD”) and Compliance and other 2nd line of defense (“2LOD”) subject matter experts to assess relevant compliance risks and controls for both the compliance risk assessment as well as the Compliance RCSA.

The primary focus of this role will be on the U.S. broker dealer and U.S. swap dealer.

  

The candidate should have a strong functional knowledge of U.S. banking regulations (e.g., Federal Reserve) as well as banking products and services. Additionally, a risk management / internal control mindset to apply and assess risk identification / mitigation is essential.

**Role Objectives**
-------------------

* Provide subject matter expertise and work with CRA team to conduct compliance risk assessments of various U.S. entities, particularly SMBC’s banking businesses serving institutional clients.
* Lead meetings with business stakeholders to understand their products/services and related risks and controls. If necessary, work with business stakeholders to design action plans to address identified control gaps.
* Assist Head of Risk and Control Assessment and CRA Program Lead in managing the CRA process, including ensuring stakeholders complete required tasks in a timely manner and that CRA team retains all required documentation.
* Assist with the continuous enhancements to the design and methodology of the CRA framework for SMBC Americas Division.
* Remain informed of regulatory changes and how they impact the CRA framework, including with respect to the completeness of the CRA’s risk scenarios or the level of inherent risk posed by SMBC’s current activities.
* Learn how to utilize newly implemented CRA technology solution and provide training to subject matter experts outside the CRA team who are required to use the tool.
* Provide leadership and guidance to CRA stakeholders as to the methodology and interpreting results.
* Present CRA results to senior 1LOD and 2LOD management, including an overview of the level of compliance risk and the strength of relevant controls.
* Develop risk dashboards designed to identifies the regulatory compliance risk profile on an ongoing basis.
* Manage the CRA team’s review and challenge responses to the RCSAs of all RCSA business units across SMBC (currently 60+ per year).
* Manage the implementation and maintenance of Compliance’s RCSA, including semi-annual RCSA risk assessments and documentation of relevant controls.
* Support the integration of the CRA results with the activities of the Compliance Department, including with respect to documenting key controls as well as driving monitoring and testing plans.

* Demonstrated track record of successfully managing projects.
* Ability to manage multiple projects simultaneously and re-prioritize workloads as necessary.
