And that includes the Wendy's family - the people you work with as a Wendy's Crew Member.  


The stuff you want - like fun people, quality food, a schedule to meet your needs, and a paycheck - done. Our founder Dave Thomas had three rules for everyone who works here: Do the right thing. Treat people with respect. Make food better than they'd expect from a fast food place. No doubt you do the first two already. We can teach you the third!  


Sounds good? Keep reading.  


**Our burgers are square, which means we don't cut corners. So hopefully, neither do you.**  

* Your natural friendliness is just one of your talents.
  
* You can handle a lot of stuff and not wig out.
  
* You're good with being on drive-thru one shift and making fries the next.
  
* You like making customers happy. For real.

  

**What you bring to the table:**  

* Solid social skills - you act like your grandma is standing behind you (at least while you're at work).
  
* You see whatever's low - ketchup, straws, cups - and you fill it back up.
  
* You pitch in and help your crew and customers.
  
* You take and receive direction like a pro.
  
* You want to learn something new and be a part of something good.
  
* If something doesn't seem right, you make it right.

  

**You must be willing and able to:**  

* Stand and move for most - if not all - of your shift.
  
* Lift up to 25-50 lbs. now and then
  
* Handle weather related moments like rain at the drive-thru, taking out trash in the summer, etc.
  
* Wear a headset, use other restaurant equipment such as a register or grill, and follow brand standards and guidelines.
  
* For more information on specific equipment or job requirements, see the job description or talk to the hiring manager.

  

**We get it. We get you.**  


Our food isn't one size fits all and our job opportunities aren't either. Whether you're looking for your first job or to build a career, a lot of hours or something to keep you busy on the weekend, you're an early bird or a night owl, we've got you covered.  


We are also a proud equal opportunity employer - that means all races, religions, nationalities, genders and the LGBTQ+ community are welcome.
