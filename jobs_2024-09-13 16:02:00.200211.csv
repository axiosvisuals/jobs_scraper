**About Actual Solutions Tutoring**

Our broad and deep talent/resource pool enables us to provide clients with a rich range of high-quality tutoring and personal coaching at very reasonable rates.

We understand that as students progress through life, their development involves more than academics. They develop dispositions that endure over time and significantly affect how they define, approach, and carry out their roles in their personal, career, and community lives. With so much at stake, it is important to provide students with the supports they need to experience success. Achieving success engenders a sense of self-efficacy - a ""can do"" attitude - and strengthens the ties between students and the world around them. In appreciation of this conceptual backdrop, Actual Solutions has committed itself to identifying, seizing, and maximizing opportunities to support families, schools, and student success.

About Dave's Hot Chicken:

Dave’s Hot Chicken was created by best friends Dave Kopushyan, Arman Oganesyan, and Tommy and Gary Rubenyan. Dave, a chef trained in Thomas Keller’s (French Laundry) organization set out to create the perfect Hot Chicken by searching, tasting, and frying. The four friends scrounged up $900 to put a tiny stand in an East Hollywood parking lot. The menu was simple, and the chicken was the star. And what chicken it is! Sourced and prepared to be the juiciest and most tender imaginable with each piece topped with Dave’s own mix of spices ranging from No Spice to “The Reaper.”

Arman created Instagram buzz and the lines began to grow. Two nights later, Eater/LA showed up to see what the fuss was about. The next morning's headline read ""East Hollywood's Late Night Chicken Stand Might Blow Your Mind."" Almost instantly, the lines stretched around the block.

A year later, the boys had the money to open a shop in a hip strip-mall with décor by local street artists, where the crowds continued to grow with wait-times of an hour and more. From there, the incredibly craveable “Hot and Spicy” varieties have created a cult following with rave reviews across the U.S. and Canada.

-------------------

  

Within *Credit Portfolio & Resource Management (CPRM)* the *Strategic Allocation and Optimization (SAO)* group is responsible for leading all aspects of optimization of resources for the balance sheet assets under the CPRM scope (Real Assets, elements of Global Trade, ASF, Corporates Financing) and ultimately for coordinating and expressing CPRM’s view on Resource Allocation and Active Portfolio Management:  



* RWAs: Optimization transactions, SRT, Capital Relief
* Risk management: secondary sales, credit insurance (portfolio and line-by-line), portfolio transactions
* Hedging: credit hedging, identification and execution of additional opportunities (IR, FX)
* Funding: liquidity raising for the CIB
* Structured Distribution (e.g. CLOs) and Distribute-to-Originate
* Portfolio relative value and indicative pricing

  

It is also the lead on special projects involving the balance sheet management and optimization.

  



In the Americas platform, the SAO team consists of two full time employees. This description is for the head of the team (director/e.d. - level) who will work in close coordination with the SAO team in London.

  



Working with CPRM ExCo, drawing on input from Transverse Portfolio teams (Insight & Analytics), the Portfolio Management, Origination and GM teams, focus on the key missions of the SAO:

  



**Optimization**


* Identify portfolio active management options for capital efficiency objectives (optimization, de-risking, limit & concentration management) in cooperation with Global Markets teams for execution (Structuring, Sales, Trading, Syndication), both at line by line and portfolio level : secondary sales, insurance, CDS, synthetic risk transfer solutions, repack…
* Analyze the pros and cons of each hedging solution depending on their impact (metrics, maneuverability e.g. requested alignment). Identify the optimal ones depending on the portfolios (e.g. relational/transactional, sector, geography) and targeted objective.
* Make a recommendation on the recommended active portfolio strategy, to be reviewed regularly and at least monthly
* Manage the existing portfolio of SRTs and other optimization solutions (insurance)
* Coordinate the development of new optimization solutions in the post-Basel3 regulatory environment
* Re-think and improve the processes around Credit Insurance (coordination, risk appetite, liquidity impact, portability & repackaging, long-term agreements)

  

**Market Access**


* Secondary sales:
	+ Review the portfolio with PM and Origination teams for Sales opportunities (de-concentration, risk management, optimization) down to ORE
	+ Steer the axe sheet and its execution from a portfolio standpoint (prioritization, coordination of execution in partnership with GM teams and PM team)
	+ Increase the tactical approach (anticipation of market trends)
	+ Follow up execution and ensure timely feedbacks to investors together with PM team and good coordination with borrowers/insurers, smooth communication across the chain and client expectation management
	+ Contribute to deliver secondary sales budget and objectives jointly with PM team
* Increase market intelligence by exchanging with market peers and GM Teams
* Foster the global portfolio angle to contribute to cross platforms trades (line by line or structured solutions)
* Establish a methodology to track relative value between the asset classes in the portfolio. Ultimately, derive a transverse risk-appetite at the CPRM level to complement the individual business line risk appetite.

  

**Distribution**


* Develop new avenues of distribution for the CIB (Funds, Structured Distribution e.g. CLOs) in coordination with Business Line origination and GM teams when needed
* Use this market intelligence to drive the Portfolio’s risk appetite and support Distribution-driven origination
* Act as the project coordinator and the “client” of the internal structuring and syndication functions
* Review existing approaches and challenge if appropriate (insurance, partnerships, participations).

**Funding**
* Explore repackaging opportunities based on CIB’s assets to raise additional liquidity (repos, secured financing, participations, repackaging)
* Lead discussions on behalf of the portfolio on transfer pricing of the liquidity raised
* Establish relationships with potential counterparties, via GM/GSF and if needed independently
* With the Portfolio Insights team, contribute to the monitoring of the encumberment of the assets for various structures and across all dimensions (pledges, green assets, replenishment opportunities etc.)

  

**Special Projects**


* Contribute to ad hoc special projects for CPRM e.g. risk analysis, credit stress testing, tools and system design, new initiatives and portfolio reviews
* Lead Quarterly Portfolio Reviews in coordination with Origination and Portfolio Management
* Coordinate with Chamonix the structuring and execution of structured trades with Chamonix Partners, alongside the Head of Distribution for Real Assets.
* Aim to integrate as many of the missions as possible into the digitalization agenda of the Financing Chain

  

**How we work**


* As part of a small team, demonstrate an ability to work across siloes in good understanding and to foster cooperation
* Expect to be involved on projects with various CPRM ExCo members
* Be a collegiate leader/ambassador within CPRM: onboard, recruit help, Sinvolve, educate and inspire colleagues from other CPRM teams into your projects
* Be a coordinator of CIB resources and expertise in other divisions to achieve your objectives (Banking Business Lines, GM structuring, syndication, distribution)

Natixis is required by law to include a reasonable estimate of the compensation range for this role. Actual base salary will vary and will be based on several factors including, but not limited to, relevant experience, education, skills set, applicable licensure and certifications, and other business and organizational needs.

**Job Category** Staff & Executive - Research (Laboratory/Non-Laboratory)
  

**Department** RWJ-Biochemistry&Molecular Biology
  

**Overview**
New Jersey’s academic health center, Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS) takes an integrated approach to educating students, providing clinical care, and conducting research, all with the goal of improving human health. Aligned with Rutgers University–New Brunswick and collaborating university wide, RBHS includes eight schools, a behavioral health network, and five centers and institutes that focus on cancer treatment and research, neuroscience, advanced biotechnology and medicine, environmental and occupational health, and health care policy and aging research.  

  

Our faculty are teachers, clinicians, and scientists with unparalleled experience who advance medical innovation and provide patient care informed by the latest research findings. We offer an outstanding education in medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, public health, nursing, biomedical research, and the full spectrum of allied health careers.  

  

Our clinical and academic facilities are located throughout the state—at Rutgers University–New Brunswick, including Piscataway; and at locations in Newark, Scotch Plains, Somerset, Stratford, and other locations. Clinical partners include Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, Newark’s University Hospital in Newark, and other affiliates.  

  

Through this community of healers, scientists, and scholars, Rutgers is equipped as never before to transform lives.
  

**Posting Summary**
Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, is seeking a Postdoctoral Associate for the department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.  

  

Applications are invited for motivated postdoctoral scholars to join the Serebrenik Laboratory in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Rutgers University – Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in the areas of neurodegeneration, genomics, proteostasis, chemical biology, and high throughput microscopy.  

  

Our lab is dedicated to elucidating how various cell compartments maintain their proteome integrity. Protein homeostasis mechanisms are essential for compartment function, and their dysregulation can lead to diseases such as neurodegeneration and cancer. We study protein homeostasis at scale throughout structurally complex cells such as neurons, with an emphasis on the Golgi apparatus which is vital for protein processing and cell communication. To enable this work, we leverage cutting edge technologies such as CRISPR, pooled protein tagging, and optical pooled screens. Our research not only seeks to uncover the diverse aspects of protein homeostasis but also aims to harness these pathways via small molecule “glues” or “tacks” to target and modify pathogenic substrates, offering new approaches for disease treatment.  

  

Among the key duties of this position are the following:* Design and lead research projects with support from the supervisor.
* Perform mammalian cell culture techniques (including work with iPSCs and iPSC-derived neurons), microscopy (fixed and live), molecular cloning, biochemical techniques, computational data exploration and analysis, and data presentation.
* Experience with programming in R and/or Python is preferred.
* Engage in scientific communication, training of junior personnel, grant writing, and manuscript preparation.
* Participate in the evaluation of existing procedures, suggesting revisions where necessary and proposing new procedures where required.
* Contribute to the development of performance standards, methodology, and instrumentation, and coordination of the analytical, biochemical, physiology, and instrumentation functions within the research areas to ensure conformance with the goals and objectives of the department. As required, assists in the implementation of the programs and projects in special areas of interest to the department.
