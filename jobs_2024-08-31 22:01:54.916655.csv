### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/U--haul","http://www.uhaul.com/","2727 North Central Avenue

UN Women, grounded in the vision of equality enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, works for the elimination of discrimination against women and girls; the empowerment of women; and the achievement of equality between women and men as partners and beneficiaries of development, human rights, humanitarian action and peace, and security.


Consistent with the UN’s renewed focus on Financing for Development (FfD) following the 2015 Addis Ababa Agenda, UN Women has launched a comprehensive set of important initiatives to ensure that financing for gender equality is enhanced and financing for development embeds a gender lens. As we do this, UN Women seeks to maximize both the quality and quantity of financing to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and SDG 5. Through context-specific policy guidance, technical support and capacity strengthening on the mobilization, allocation and spending of high-impact financing aligned with gender equality objectives, UN Women aims to encourage and support the development and deployment of innovative financial instruments aligned with its vision for an equitable and just global economy. UN Women is equally committed to the development of frameworks, guidelines and standards, which are needed to make financing for gender equality accessible and transparent, and lead to lasting social change and positive effects for women’s economic and social rights, livelihoods, and wellbeing.


Given its gender expertise, convening capacity and well-established partnerships with governments, UN entities, standard setting bodies, IFIs, and the private sector, UN Women, will implement its Sustainable Finance Programme with a view to leveraging these strategic partnerships for the growth of credible feminist financing instruments and mechanisms at global, national and local levels that will ultimately contribute to reducing gender inequalities and strengthening women’s rights and economic autonomy.


Reporting to the Chief Economic Empowerment, the Head of Sustainable Finance will assume overall responsibility for the planning, implementation, and management of UN Women’s Sustainable Finance Strategy as well as the implementation and delivery of UN Women’s Sustainable Finance Programme (SFP).


**Duties and Responsibilities**
-------------------------------


**1. Lead the implementation and delivery of UN Women’s Sustainable Strategy and UN Women’s Sustainable Finance Programme (SFP)**

* Ensure the conceptualization and implementation of a transformative feminist Sustainable Finance Strategy and Programme, in consultation with public and private sector and civil society partners, including feminist economists.
* Oversee the deployment of required technical expertise and provide critical backstopping to deliver UN Women’s SFSP.
* Provide expert policy and technical inputs related to sustainable finance, impact investing, financing for gender equality and a range of gender – focused feminist financing instruments and policies, ensuring synergies with internal and external partners.
* Review and oversee substantive inputs into internal and external reporting, focusing on results, outputs, and outcomes, ensuring the highest quality and feminist expertise on Gender Lens Investing (GLI) and sustainable finance.
* Provide thought leadership and lead the drafting of knowledge products on sustainable finance and GLI for internal and external audiences.
* Oversee the finalization of strategy documents, programme/ project proposals, briefs, policy dialogue, and other documents related to feminist sustainable finance and GLI.

**2. Develop and expand key partnerships to accomplish the objectives set out in UN Women’s Strategic Plan on Financing for Gender equality and the SFP**

* Broker partnerships with sustainable finance and capital market stakeholders and public and private sector and civil society organizations working on financing for gender equality.
* Convene high-level roundtables and expert meetings (with private finance stakeholders, with Ministries of Finance and International Financial Institutions, feminist economists specialized in development financing, etc.) around sustainable financing for gender equality.
* Lead UN Women’s engagement with industry alliances and technical working groups, as well as financing for gender equality partners.
* Pursue and deliver speaking engagements alongside partners at industry convenings.

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/U--haul","http://www.uhaul.com/","2727 North Central Avenue
