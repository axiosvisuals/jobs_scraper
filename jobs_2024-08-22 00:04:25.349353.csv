Location: **New York, NY**

  

We are the first loyalty program that rewards members on rent and in their neighborhood, no matter where they live.


Our Members can earn points and access exclusive benefits on rent payments, condo & co-op fees, and around their neighborhood at local restaurants, fitness studios, rideshare, and more. Ranked the highest-value point currency by top publications, our Points can be transferred 1:1 to major airline and hotel programs, or used towards rent payments, shopping, fitness, and even a down payment on a home. Members also get access to credit-building benefits, member-only experiences, and an Elite Status program.


In partnership with the top multifamily owners & operators across the country, we’ve also created an Alliance, a network of 4M+ apartments and homes across the country. Residents who live in the Alliance make payments directly through the Payment Center and get access to benefits including additional earn opportunities on new leases, renewals, and more.


While our Members can use any debit or credit card to earn points and access their benefits, we've partnered with Mastercard and Wells Fargo to create the Mastercard - the first and only credit card that lets you pay rent and earn points without the transaction fee.

**What’s the role?**


As the Director of Consumer Banking, you will be responsible for driving sustainable portfolio growth by attracting customers who engage fully with our suite of products and features. You will be working on the strategy, product roadmap, and day-to-day program management of all consumer banking products.


Your key objective in this role is to increase in-network adoption of our consumer banking products and drive sustainable engagement - that might include developing features or marketing treatments that increase the engagement level of our Members with our different consumer banking products: The Mastercard, Rent Reporting, and Homeownership services.

**In this role, you will…**

* **Customer Insights**: Deeply understand the needs, behaviors, and profiles our Members who live in an Alliance building and/or who engage in Rent Reporting.
* **Feature usage:** Monitor product and feature usage to uncover opportunities or gaps.
* **Product Iteration:** Strong bias for iterative product and marketing experimentation. Insatiable curiosity on how to improve the customer experience
* **Program Roadmap development:** Use customer insights to inform existing program enhancements or to launch new product solutions. Articulate business case and rationale, then execute.
* **Marketing program development:** In partnership with marketing, create and drive marketing programs that increase user engagement and cross-sell.
* **Partner management:** Work closely with marketing, product, engineering, data and customer success team members, as well as vendors. You will serve as a conduit to the rest of the consumer banking organization and to vendors.
* **Project Management:** Act as a catalyst and then help coordinate the development of launch initiatives
* **Vendor Management:** Identify and filter potential vendors that could help power new consumer banking solutions for customers
* **KPI:** You will be accountable for driving KPIs that signal improved customer engagement and cross-sell

**In terms of qualifications, we’re seeking:**


You are a strategic individual who soaks up data and proactively identifies solutions that address customer and business needs. You are proactive and don’t wait to be told what to do. Although you are comfortable with big-picture strategy, jumping into the details and getting your hands dirty in execution comes naturally to you. Your attention to detail is evident in how you communicate - you are precise and inspire confidence, which allows you to interact effectively across functions and seniority. You enjoy partnering across the aisle to drive the best solution possible for your customers.

We believe in transparency, and we do our best to make sure the company and our candidates are on the same page as it relates to compensation. In addition to posting salary ranges for our open roles, candidates should expect to be asked about compensation expectations and requirements early on in their interview process. Our goal is to highlight when expectations and our salary range may be out of sync, and work with the candidate to determine whether it makes sense to continue conversations.


We are considering candidates with differing levels of expertise for this position. Leveling will be based upon your experience and performance in the interview process.


Where a new hire falls within a range will be based on their individual skills and experience, and how these competencies compare across other employees in the same role. Our bands are designed to allow for individual compensation growth within the role. As such, new hires typically start at the lower end of the range. Our performance and outcomes - should you join the company, you will have the opportunity to grow your salary over time.


The salary range for a **Director, Consumer Banking** is **$160,000 - 170,000** and will be eligible for equity and an annual performance-based bonus.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Recruitment-Room-7","","","","","","","","",""

The Center for Justice Innovation (formerly the Center for Court Innovation) is a non-profit organization that works with communities and justice systems to advance equity, increase safety, and help individuals and communities thrive. The Center's goal is to identify and resolve as early as possible the challenges that bring people into the criminal and civil legal systems. It does this in a number of ways—by developing and running programs that reduce the need for incarceration and enhance economic opportunity, conducting original research to identify what works, and sharing what we learn from our programming and research with those seeking to transform the justice system around the world.


The Center is a 900-employee, $100 million nonprofit that accomplishes its vision through three pillars of work: creating and scaling operating programs to test new ideas and solve problems, performing original research to determine what works (and what doesn’t), and providing expert assistance and policy guidance to justice reformers around the world.

**Operating Programs**


The Center’s operating programs, including the award-winning Red Hook Community Justice Center and Midtown Community Justice Center, test new ideas, solve difficult problems, and attempt to achieve systemic change within the justice system. Our projects include community-based violence prevention programs, alternatives to incarceration, reentry initiatives, and court-based initiatives that reduce the use of unnecessary incarceration and promote positive individual and family change. Through this programming, we have produced tangible results like safer streets, reduced incarceration, and improved neighborhood perceptions of justice.

**Research**


The Center's research teams are staffed with social scientists, data analysts, and lawyers who are academically-trained or have lived experience and who conduct research in the U.S. and globally on diverse criminal-legal system and justice issues. Their work includes evaluating programs and policies; conducting exploratory, community-based studies; and providing research translation and strategic planning for system actors. The Center has published studies on topics including court and jail reform, intimate partner violence, restorative justice, gun violence, reentry, sixth amendment rights, and progressive prosecution. The research teams strive to make their work meaningful and actionable to the communities they work with, policymakers, and practitioners.

**Policy & Expert Assistance**


The Center provides hands-on, planning and implementation assistance to a wide range of jurisdictions in areas of reform such as problem-solving courts (e.g., community courts, treatment courts, domestic violence courts), tribal justice, reducing incarceration and the use of fines/fees and reducing crime and violence. Our current expert assistance takes many forms, including help with analyzing data, strategic planning and consultation, policy guidance, and hosting site visits to its operating programs in the New York City area.

**Center Support**


A dedicated support team within the Center ensures the smooth functioning of operations across various domains, including finance, legal, technology, human resources, fundraising, real estate, and communications. Comprising 15% of the organization's staff, these teams provide essential infrastructure support and innovative solutions aligned with the Center's mission and values.

**THE OPPORTUNITY**


Brooklyn Justice Initiatives (BJI), the largest operating project of the Center, seeks to re-engineer the experience of criminal court in Brooklyn, New York, by providing judges and attorneys meaningful alternatives to bail, fines, and jail sentences. Operating out of Kings County Criminal Court along with community-based offices, BJI is a team of social service providers, court-based resource coordinators, mental health practitioners, compliance specialists, and others who seek to improve the quality of justice. Supervised Release offers an alternative to jail by providing pretrial supervision, case management, and voluntary social services to people charged with misdemeanor and felony offenses, and in doing so, uses an arrest as a window of opportunity to change the direction of a participant’s life, avoiding the harmful effects of incarceration. Program participants are monitored to ensure their appearance at court dates and mandatory programming, and receive referrals to services like job training, drug treatment, and mental health counseling.


BJI is seeking a Coordinator, Group Work for the borough’s Supervised Release Program (SRP) which provides case management and social service connection to thousands of court-mandated participants each year. Reporting to the Clinical Director, the Group Work Coordinator will manage the participant group work portfolio. This role will require exemplary group facilitation and project management skills. Specifically, the Group Work Coordinator will oversee the development, implementation, facilitation, and quality assurance of a diverse catalog of groups that will run throughout the year and vary in content and format. Group content will vary from psycho-educational to skill-based; group formats may include one-time sessions, ongoing series, and closed and open formats. All groups will aim to substantively address participant needs and count toward their pretrial supervision compliance status. The Group Work Coordinator will both facilitate groups and provide training and guidance for direct practice staff responsible for co-facilitation to help staff develop their group work skills, including generating group participation, asserting healthy boundaries, and responding with dignity to constructive feedback and conflict.


The Center for Justice Innovation strongly encourage and seek applications from women, people of color, LGBTQIA community members, as well as individuals with lived experience with the legal system.

DMF Youth is a 501(c)3 nonprofit that empowers underserved students through dance education and life skill development programs that build self-confidence, resilience, and grit. Our holistic approach to learning combines dance, mentorship, and Social Emotional Learning (SEL). Driven by the vision of an equitable education system, we partner with Title 1 schools and homeless shelters across NYC to deliver free, accessible afterschool and summer programs to elementary and middle school students.

DMF Youth was created to narrow opportunity gaps by providing students in overlooked neighborhoods with dance education and life skill development programs. Founded in late 2014, DMF Youth began programming in the summer of 2015 with one program. Since launching, we’ve expanded to seven sites and eight programs. DMF Youth has served nearly 1000 students, ages 5-14, across all five boroughs. Our current partner schools and shelters are located in East New York, Brooklyn, East Harlem, and the Bronx. By working with teachers, psychologists, artists, and community members with years of experience in the field, we created a comprehensive curriculum that provides students with the physical, mental, and emotional support they need to thrive in school and in life. Dance provides an avenue for children to express their emotions, broaden their cultural perspectives, and build relationships with themselves and others. Pairing dance with Social Emotional Learning (SEL) is an impactful strategy to engage and empower our students. The five competencies of SEL (self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision making) are woven into our curriculum and are key components in helping youth navigate academic, social, and life challenges

Join a small but growing team of passionate educators working directly with Title 1 schools and homeless shelters across NYC to deliver high-impact dance and life-skill development afterschool/summer programs.

**About the Position**

The Part time Assistant Program Director (APD) will assist with overseeing all aspects of afterschool and summer programming across various sites in East Harlem, East New York, BK, and the Bronx. The APD will lead 1-2 teams of teaching artists and ensure teaching artists are delivering programming in alignment with DMF Youth standards and teaching philosophies. The ability to coach staff toward excellence and provide quality professional development is a must. APD will assist with school and CBO partnerships, establishing relationships with school/CBO contacts and assisting with planning, scheduling, implementation, and recruitment. APD will work closely with the Program Director on program development, including but not limited to curriculum development, lesson planning, coordinating guest speakers/teachers, and incorporating partner school/site goals into all programming. The APD is required to work onsite at our various schools/shelters in the afternoon (2pm-5:30pm or 6pm), assisting in teaching when necessary, providing extra support to program staff, and ensuring program goals are being met. In addition, APD will ensure all compliance and safety requirements set forth by DMF Youth, school/CBO partners, DOE, funders, and other applicable laws and regulations are being met.

A day in the life of the Assistant Program Director has two main elements - administrative work and program management. Your mornings may include meeting and planning with school leaders, staff, and the executive director, updating and maintaining youth management systems, and writing lesson plans and reports– some of this work can also be done in evenings or weekends if that works better for schedule. During the afternoon, the APD will be on-site ensuring programs are running smoothly by observing and implementing enriching activities, engaging with students, supervising teaching artists, and troubleshooting any issues that arise.

This part-time position begins immediately and will require 22-25 hours per week. Our goal is to transition this role into a full-time position by January or February of 2025.

**Responsibilities**

* Guarantee the provision of high-quality afterschool programming at school and shelter partner sites
* Supervise and manage all day-to-day logistics of afterschool programs, including but not limited to: staff accountability and scheduling; parent and school communications, student safety and attendance; and delivery of designed DMF Youth curricula.

* Work in coordination with school-based operations and leadership to develop sustainable systems for student safety, dismissal procedures, and use of shared space.
* Collaborate with school leadership to ensure program delivery aligns school’s goals and expectations.
* Represent program needs and planning to school partners and stakeholders

**Who You Are**

You are an accomplished educator (dance a plus!) with experience in afterschool settings. You have vast experience working with youth and are comfortable leading a staff of adults. You can think about big-picture ideas, while also focusing on day-to-day operational tasks. You’re excited to lead a team of educators who want to bring joy, creativity, and fun to kids everyday, while providing a structured and safe environment to do so. You are a team player and eager to work with a passionate group of teachers to ensure underserved youth receive quality mentorship and enrichment.
