New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation

**Outposted Therapeutic Housing Units Program (OTxHU)**


Since 2016, Correctional Health Services (CHS) has been the direct provider of health care in the New York City jails. Deeply committed to human dignity and patient rights, CHS is part of the NYC Health + Hospitals system and is a key partner in the City’s efforts to reform the criminal-legal system. Our in-jail clinical services include medical, nursing, and mental health care; pharmacy services; substance-use treatment; social work; dental and vision care; discharge planning; and reentry support.




Given the high visibility of this initiative, we are seeking the highest caliber health care professionals in key clinical services to staff our Outposted Therapeutic Housing Units (OTxHU). To be located in three NYC Health + Hospital acute care facilities, the OTxHU is a pioneering approach to safely increasing access to high quality clinical care for patients in custody who have complicated health conditions. OTxHUs will bridge the gap in the continuum between care provided in the jails and inpatient hospitalization, with admission to and discharge from the OTxHU in accordance with a patient’s clinical needs. CHS will be the primary health care providers on these units and the NYC Department of Correction will provide security and custody management.




The OTxHU at NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue in Manhattan will be the first of this unique, groundbreaking project to open with a planned completion date as early as the end of 2024. This is an incredible opportunity to be part of a passionate and motivated team providing care to some of the City’s most marginalized, vulnerable people.

* To help support continuity of operations and care, staff selected to work in the OTxHU may also be required to work in CHS locations within the jails. Additionally, while CHS seeks the most qualified individuals for these positions, preference will be given to equally qualified, internal candidates.

* You’re a clear **communicator** who can create the right narrative to share your ideas with a wide range of people, such as introducing our products and services to new clients and experts. You always look for the most **efficient** way to get things done, rather than the path of least resistance - for example you **pick up the phone** to get an answer to your questions straight away, rather than send an email and wait for a reply. Cold calling doesn’t phase you - what matters to you is to get results, and fast.
* Your attitude is to **roll up your sleeves** and you enjoy being in the thick of the action together with others. It matters a great deal to you to understand how your performance ranks against your own potential and against others, so you continuously seek **feedback** to make sure you can be at the top of your game. One of your clients preferring a competitor over you is not an acceptable state of affairs for you - you’re **relentless** in getting the data points you need to adjust your approach until you are their number one. With the **skills** gained on the job (hard skills are getting displaced by machines), you aspire to a future as a high EQ business leader.

  

**Additional Information** **What our people love about being Associates in Consulting Clients:**

* Being surrounded by people they not only enjoy working with, but who also challenge and support them from the peer level up through senior management.
* Owning individual responsibilities to grow our business, while also being in a team-oriented environment and working closely with their peers.
* Consultants truly lean on Third Bridge for their research, whether for strategy consulting or diligence work. Our clients are appreciative of and value our support and partnership.
* Getting to dip their toes into every imaginable industry under the sun, and getting exposed to a variety of individuals with unique perspectives and backgrounds.
* Building strong relationships both internally and externally create significant opportunities for professional development.
* We win together as a team.

 **Thrive at Third Bridge!**


Expect your total **first-year compensation to be in excess of $70,000**, including bonus. Beyond pay, you can expect clear performance goals and to be recognised for your contributions.

We are trailblazing a new paradigm for women's healthcare that treats women as whole people vs. parts or life stages. Blending in-person and virtual care services, Tia's ""Whole Woman, Whole Life"" care model fuses gynecology, primary care, mental health and evidence-based wellness services to treat women comprehensively. By making women's health higher quality and lower cost, Tia makes women healthier, providers happier, and the business of care delivery stronger — setting a new standard of care for women everywhere.



Tia has raised more than $132 Million in venture capital funding to date, including a recent $100 Million Series B investment, one of the largest early-stage rounds ever for a healthcare company focused on women. Tia has ambitious plans to scale its ""whole-woman, whole-life"" model to more than 100,000 women by 2023. We'll do this by growing virtual and in-person operations in existing and new markets while expanding its service lines to care for women throughout their entire lives - from puberty to menopause. Since launching in 2017, Tia has grown to serve thousands of women aged 18-80 with blended in-person and virtual care in New York City, Los Angeles, Phoenix and soon San Francisco.



We're building a world class team to reimagine women's healthcare. We're an interdisciplinary team of clinicians, researchers, designers, technologists and operators who have seen firsthand how broken the healthcare system is for women. We're united by a powerful mission to enable every woman to achieve optimal health, as defined by herself, as well as a shared set of values and principles that define our business, products, and culture.



Tia is building a culture of **excellence** — in people, process and product. This is our northstar value;


*What is excellence, exactly?*



Excellence about constantly elevating yourself, it is the process of constantly striving to perform to the best of your abilities, and identifying your top potential through constant learning, experimentation and evolution. Excellence is not about achieving perfection, as that insinuates a pinnacle. Instead, in our terms, excellence is about the pursuit of constant improvement. We're looking for people who want to go on that hard journey of constantly setting new personal records, and organizational records.



We practice excellence at Tia by demonstrating the following types of behaviors: We chose (and actively choose) excellence as Tia's highest order value because it crystalizes into one word several behaviors that we hold dear, specifically:



* A drive to **constantly improve through experimentation**, reflection. and an insatiable growth mindset — said another way, we're energized by the possibility of invention, innovation, and iteration


* **Being present in and grateful for the journey** — not just the goal line. Perfection is static. Excellence is a process (more on this important distinction below)


* **Asking why, then why again** — because accepting ""this is just the way it is"" is not good enough


* **Grit & perseverance** — a maker mentality that involves ""rolling up your sleeves"", *but also* deep care for oneself and for others


* **A commitment to uncovering talents** to unlock ""rock star"" potential across every individual



**Benefits (Clinic)**


* **Free Tia Membership:** Enjoy complimentary access to Tia's premium services.
* **Comprehensive Health Coverage:** Full-time employees receive medical, dental, and vision benefits, along with access to additional support for infertility services.
* **Insurance Package:** Gain coverage with life, AD&D, STD, and LTD insurance, and explore voluntary options for Critical Illness, Accident Insurance, and Life coverage for you and your family.
* **Financial Flexibility:** Take advantage of Health Spending Account, Flexible Spending Account, and Dependent Care Spending Account options.
* **Emotional Well-being Support:** Access Ginger+ (Headspace+) for Emotional Health Coaching and 8 Virtual Therapy Sessions for both you and eligible dependents aged 13 and above.
* **Retirement Planning:** Participate in our 401k program (no matching currently) to secure your financial future.
* **Team Bonding Opportunities:** Enjoy a travel stipend for team off-sites, complementing our commuter benefits program.
* **Time Off Flexibility:** Tia's comprehensive benefits extend to our Paid Time Off (PTO) program, providing employees with paid time off for vacations, personal needs, or as supplemental sick time.
* **Tech Excellence:** Depending on your role, access top-tier technology, including a 13"" MacBook Pro, iPad, or other Apple devices.
* **Professional Development Support:** In addition to our existing benefits, Tia values the growth of our medical care providers and offers a Continuing Education Reimbursement program.


Furthermore, excellence reflects the ""bigness"" and the ""boldness"" of Tia's mission and vision — a world in which every woman can achieve optimal health, as defined by herself.



Said another way, Tia's mission is NOT to make healthcare *incrementally better* for women. Instead, we've intentionally set out to create a fundamentally new paradigm for modern women's healthcare that's truly *excellent*. We believe that creating a company that operates in a culture of excellence will manifest in our product. Reaching this goal is not an overnight pursuit or a ""one and done."" We have not and will not ""get it right"" with the first swing. Rather, this higher order goal is a moving target — one we have not and will not ever fully ""achieve."" By design, we will never be ""done"" with this work, but instead, we will be continuously in pursuit of our mission. It is this continuous pursuit — the journey, not the finish line — that truly embodies excellence.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Tia-2f9f8c13","http://www.asktia.com","San Francisco, CA","201 to 500","Decline to state","Tia offers gynecology, primary care, acupuncture, and mental health therapy all under one roof.","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/26fcdbd472e06861424badda99dbfe34","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_headerimage/1960x400/e83a0915593398288099b1c874100749","Carolyn Witte","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_ceophoto/512x512/b34743fc99c7dbae9821fe250b20fff2"

Our in-jail clinical services include medical, nursing, and mental health care; pharmacy services; substance-use treatment; social work; dental and vision care; discharge planning; and reentry support.

Given the high visibility of this initiative, we are seeking the highest caliber health care professionals in key clinical services to staff our Outposted Therapeutic Housing Units (OTxHU). To be located in three NYC Health + Hospital acute care facilities, the OTxHU is a pioneering approach to safely increasing access to high quality clinical care for patients in custody who have complicated health conditions. OTxHUs will bridge the gap in the continuum between care provided in the jails and inpatient hospitalization, with admission to and discharge from the OTxHU in accordance with a patient’s clinical needs. CHS will be the primary health care providers on these units and the NYC Department of Correction will provide security and custody management.

The OTxHU at NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue in Manhattan will be the first of this unique, groundbreaking project to open with a planned completion date as early as the end of 2024. This is an incredible opportunity to be part of a passionate and motivated team providing care to some of the City’s most marginalized, vulnerable people.

\\*To help support continuity of operations and care, staff selected to work in the OTxHU may also be required to work in CHS locations within the jails. Additionally, while CHS seeks the most qualified individuals for these positions, preference will be given to equally qualified, internal candidates.

Are you an experienced litigation paralegal who is ready to take your career to the next level? Do you have a proven track record of success in handling complex and high-stakes cases? If so, you might be the ideal candidate for our litigation paralegal position!


Founded in 1958, McMahon, Martine & Gallagher, LLP (MMG) is a well-established and reputable firm that specializes in defending clients in a wide range of lawsuits including: construction accident liability, premises liability, medical malpractice, toxic torts, products liability, personal and commercial automobile liability, and homeowner liability.

As a Paralegal at our firm, you will enjoy:

* **The chance to take your career to the next level!** We value dedication and high-quality work in our employees, and we want to see them be successful every day. We want to reward talent and diligence with opportunities to learn new things and grow as a paralegal, as well as take advantage of your expertise to navigate complex matters through innovative problem-solving and collaborative solutions.
* **Independence.** You won't have anyone breathing down your neck on every single thing you do. We believe in letting talented people do what they do best without micromanaging or imposing additional deadlines on top of their workload for our clients. If you enjoy working in a highly autonomous, fast-paced, dynamic environment where exciting new challenges are never in short supply, then we want to hear from you!
* **An informal and relaxed atmosphere.** While we thrive in the quick and dynamic environment of litigation, we also believe in a more relaxed and collegial workplace than you might find at other mega-firms. Rapport with coworkers fosters learning and trust on a daily basis, and we encourage you to get to know your desk neighbors and grab a drink with them at our regular happy hours. We're firm of desk decorations, office snacks, and friendly working relationships!

We are looking for paralegals who strive for excellence every day and prove time and time again that they are truly the bedrock with which a good litigator works a full case load.


If you are looking for a job where you are just a number in a sea of faces and never need to learn the names of your coworkers, then this may not be the position for you. But, if you are looking for a firm that will appreciate your skills and talents, support your career goals, and see you as a unique individual with lots to contribute, then look no further.


To qualify for this position, you must have:

* A paralegal certificate or degree from an accredited program, or equivalent experience
