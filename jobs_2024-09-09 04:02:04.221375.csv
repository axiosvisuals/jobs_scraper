**Who We Are**



Our fundamental belief at Freudigman & Billings is that children learn best in the context of supportive relationships. We are committed to helping students better understand how they learn and how they can take ownership of that learning. Our team provides educational solutions for adolescents and children through individual assessment, personally tailored learning programs, and one-on-one coaching.

 **What We Do**



Freudigman & Billings uses an efficacious approach to instructional coaching influenced by the founders’ collective experience working in cognitive science at Yale University. Our Instructors provide holistic academic support for high school students across a variety of educational domains. The work is as rewarding as it is challenging as we help students navigate some of the more meaningful steps forward in their education. Our instructors are empathetic and exercise a flexible mindset.

 **Who You Are**



The ideal candidate has a B.A./B.S. and some experience tutoring or teaching high school students (or an inherent desire to learn to teach). We are looking for smart, personable, committed individuals who exhibit the potential to grow. We’ll train you, but you need to bring the fire. Whether it’s an in-depth knowledge of TikTok trends or the best comedic timing we’ve ever seen, you need something that’ll help you create an authentic relationship with a sleep-deprived teenager. You will also have the opportunity to be considered for our rotational program and train across multiple disciplines, including Educational Therapy and Standardized Test Prep, so that you can expand your skills and develop new ways to engage with students.

 **Why Join Freudigman & Billings?**


**Predictable hours at a single office location:** Almost always, our work with students takes place at our 11,000 square foot headquarters in Westport, CT. Students are encouraged to utilize our space not only to see their instructors, but to do homework, hang out with friends, have a snack, get some advice, or even catch a quick nap during finals week. Instructors are provided with a private classroom, a whiteboard, and all materials necessary for a productive session.

 **Teamwork:** We work closely together on a daily basis to create and execute individualized learning plans, meaning that our work is far more comprehensive and impactful than a transactional hour of “tutoring.” We are proud of the collegiality that our building and our philosophy inspires, as well as the team of educators we have attracted as a result.

 **Professional development:** We care about our staff and teaching you how to teach. Our team of Directors have PhDs, Masters degrees, and other certifications to help you achieve your goals and help you gain mastery of your own instructional techniques. You will learn our pedagogy and have the opportunity to experience career growth.

 **Administrative support:** We have a full time team that handles scheduling, billing, and inventory and printing of materials.

 **Great benefits:** Fourteen days of paid time off, ten paid holidays, and five sick days. Medical, dental, and vision insurance, short and long term disability insurance, paid parental leave, and a 401k plan.

 **Great pay:** A guaranteed salary.

 **Requirements**


* Bachelor’s Degree in Physics, Mathematics, or another related field.
* Computer savvy, exceptional communication skills, and attention to detail
* Ability to thrive and demonstrate confidence in a fast-paced environment
* Ability to pass a background check
* This is not a remote position. Reliable transportation is necessary.
* Full time schedule is typically 12:30pm to 9pm Monday through Thursday, and 11am to 7:30pm on Sundays.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Freudigman-&-Billings","http://www.freudigman.com","1720 Post Road East #113
