### **About the Company**


We believe it should be easy for pet parents to do the right thing. At Pawlicy Advisor, personalized advice from the most trustworthy experts ensures pets get the best care possible.


Pawlicy Advisor is a fast-growing, fully-remote, venture-backed startup focused on helping pet owners around the country find the right health products for their pets, starting with pet health insurance. Pet insurance’s popularity is growing rapidly as pet owners seek protection from the high cost of veterinary care. Our pet insurance marketplace takes into account a pet’s breed-specific health risks to help people find the right policy for their pet. We also save pet owners money by analyzing pricing differences and premium increases over the lifetime of an animal.


We market to pet parents through a number of channels, but the partners we value the most are veterinarians. Vets love pet insurance because it increases that chance a pet parent will be able to afford the cost of treatment, but vets don’t know what providers to recommend and don’t want the liability associated with recommending a specific brand. Pawlicy Advisor helps thousands of vet offices across the US by simplifying the treatment financing conversation.


Where is the Pawlicy Advisor team located?


Pawlicy is headquartered in NYC and currently the majority of the team operates remotely with a few focused work places around the country such as San Francisco and NYC. We meet up for company offsites on a regular basis where we fly the whole team out to a fun destination and spend a few days team building. Our last few involved paddle boarding, ropes courses, horse riding, and some early morning yoga. We can’t wait for the next one ﻿﻿


How large are you as a business?


At the time this job post was written, we’re 30. By the end of 2024 we expect to be at approximately 35. Happy to talk more about it in person but below are few stats to get you excited:

* 1000’s of veterinarians are using our product every day to help educate their clients about treatment financing options
* We account for a meaningful percentage of the total new pet insurance selected in the US
* We’ve raised >$19M in venture capital to date

How does Pawlicy Advisor make money?


We're a licensed insurance agency so we get paid a commission by the pet insurance company when we help pet parents buy a plan for their pet. These commissions are already priced into the cost of pet health insurance so they’re not paying extra to work with us.

**Requirements**

* Minimum 5 years’ progressive senior administrative experience supporting C-suite and teams in a professional, high-energy environment
* Experienced in Google Suite, Zoom, Slack, with desire and willingness to learn new software
* Exceptional attention to detail
