The position is for an Independent Contractor (1099) in the NYC area and will be an entirely commission-based salary. We are seeking a charismatic and dynamic Field Sales Representative to join our team.

More often than not, special needs adults have little opportunity to meet and form relationships with others. They are alone and lonely without ways to meet and connect with others. Even when they are in programs with others, they lack the basic skills to form and maintain meaningful relationships. As Special Needs Matchmakers, we hand-pick matches for our members for both friendship and romance. In addition, we provide the necessary coaching to teach and support the process.

We're looking for Sales representatives who can work with us to find both a pool of potential matches as well as members who want matches made for them. To do this, the representative would first need to identify places where Special needs adults are. Then, will need to establish and cultivate relationships with the administration to gain entry to the participants, eventually meeting them on-site. With both the administration and participants, the Sales Representative will share this new and innovative company. What we know is that when people learn of the business, it sells itself. It's a very needed service and when the right people know about it, they are generally interested. Getting the word to the right people is the most important part and the main job of the Sales Representative.

An understanding of Developmental Disabilities is helpful, though not necessary. The position requires availability on weekdays, 9-5. You can make your own hours, though a minimum of 10 weekday hours is necessary. Part of the time making calls to explore possibilities and make connections and the other part, to visit sites and meet with people in person. The more time you put in, the more money you will make. You must have your own transportation. Brief training for 1-2 hours is necessary to start and is done remotely. There also will be virtual meetings 2x month to participate in meetings with the other representatives to share invites and progress.

If you are a results-driven individual with an interest in helping people, a passion for sales, and a knack for connecting with others and building strong client relationships, we encourage you to apply for the Field Sales Representative position with us.
