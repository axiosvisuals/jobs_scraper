Buddy Web Design & Development is a growing, entrepreneurial, and award-winning website design and development company headquartered in the Grand Rapids, Michigan area. Buddy has built a portfolio of clients across the United States, and is currently seeking help to grow the business by identifying and helping to secure new client projects.

Buddy is seeking an independent contractor who can spearhead sales and, in particular, lead-generation activities, including prospecting, outreach, and qualifying new sales leads. This work can be done remotely and part time, according to a schedule of your choosing.

While Buddy has traditionally offered high-quality website design and development and graphic design services for small- and mid-sized clients across a variety of industries, we're excited to add some additional new services and targeted opportunities this year. In particular, Buddy is adding to its service offering ongoing website support and maintenance plans, as well as ""all-in-one"" plans where Buddy designs, builds, and launches a new website for clients, and then takes care of ongoing hosting, maintenance, monitoring, updates, and edit requests, all for a low monthly fee, rather than the more traditional ""lump sum"" payment structure. We are excited about both these maintenance and all-in-one packages opening the doors to new prospective clients.

Further, Buddy is launching more targeted marketing efforts for these all-in-one plans, focusing initially on blue collar trades (buddywdd.com/tr) and healthcare practices (buddywdd.com/hc).

We're excited to partner with an experienced sales individual to help champion sales efforts for these new initiatives. An ideal person for this opportunity will have an entrepreneurial mindset, friendly and outgoing personality, and high degree of professionalism and integrity, coupled with a comfort and willingness to identify and reach out to prospective clients and build mutually beneficial relationships.

5+ years of business-to-business sales experience and a record of success is required, particularly in a sales role where you were required to generate your own leads, rather than working off a provided sales prospect list or via inbound leads.

Please note that this role is structured as an independent contractor opportunity, with compensation structured as commission only.

If this sounds interesting to you, and you’re excited to help grow an entrepreneurial business providing an in-demand technology service, please apply here.

NOTE: When applying, please be sure to share your experience regarding sales and lead generation in the accompanying screening questions, as well as affirming that you understand that this is a commission-based, independent contractor role. Applicants without responses to these questions will not be considered.
