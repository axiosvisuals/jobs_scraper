At Chick-fil-A Teterboro Landing FSR our purpose is “to enrich lives on both sides of the counter, by creating a culture of care.” Our biggest focus is on our team members. We understand that if we can positively influence and impact our team, then that will overflow into a genuine care to provide excellent service that goes above and beyond to our guests.
  
  

Why should you apply with us today? Please allow me to give you three reasons.
  
  

1. Engaged Leadership - We have a leadership team that is on your side. It is our goal to help you win and help you become the best version of yourself. Whether Chick-fil-A is just a stepping stone or a career path, our goal is to develop life and leadership skills that will make you successful and competitive no matter where you go!
  
2. Opportunities for growth - We are a rapidly growing restaurant and we are constantly looking to develop talented leaders that have a passion to serve and help others. Opportunities include trainers, team leaders, shift leaders, directors of operations, marketing, talent, training and hospitality are all leadership positions within our restaurant. Not only are there in-restaurant opportunities, but the talents and leadership skills developed at Chick-fil-A can be used in whatever work environment you decide to pursue.
  
3. Impact and purpose - Chick-fil-A of Teterboro Landing FSR is looking to create an impact in our local communities by providing donations with local schools, churches, charitable organizations and even other businesses.

Requirements/Responsibilities
  
Do you have what we're looking for?
  
  

There are really 5 crucial that we look for in our team members. We believe that out of these 5 things, most other qualities or requirements will flow naturally.
  
  

1. Reliable - We are looking for individuals that we can count on. We need to be able to trust that you will arrive punctually to each shift you’ve been assigned, and that you will accomplish the tasks assigned to you.
  
2. Integrity - We want a committed team that we can trust to handle ALL guest interactions with the utmost care. We also understand the importance of teamwork, which means there needs to be a level of trust that is deep and genuine with the attitude of a servant’s heart. You must be trustworthy in all circumstances in order to gain the trust of individuals.
  
3. Hungry - (I’m sorry, but this doesn’t relate to food;) We are looking for individuals who have a passion for growth. Hungry team members take efforts to improve themselves during and outside of work, they have plans for bettering themselves. Hungry team members are always striving to do and accomplish more even when others don’t see anything that needs to be done. In other words, you push hard and strive to be the best you can.
  
4. Humble - Humility is the lynchpin of being on a team. If you can’t admit weaknesses, confess mistakes and ask for help from others, this will be a difficult job for you. Everyone makes mistakes, but it’s how we humble ourselves so others can address us, and how we learn from them that matters.
  
5. Smart - This refers to both being smart intellectually, but more importantly, to emotional intelligence. It means that you are wise in communicating, and understand the impact that your words, attitude or body language can have. It means understanding people and knowing what or what not to say, and when or when not to say it.
  
  

These are some of the main qualities that we are looking for in our team members. As I have said before, teamwork is so important to everything done in the restaurant. If you are not looking for a place that will challenge you to grow, incur great communication, and push you to put others first, you will not enjoy working here. We are heavily invested in character development and striving to bring out the best in each of our team members.

 **About Dave's Hot Chicken**  

  

**Dave’s Hot Chicken was created by best friends Dave Kopushyan, Arman Oganesyan, and Tommy and Gary Rubenyan. Dave, a chef trained in Thomas Keller’s (French Laundry) organization set out to create the perfect Hot Chicken by searching, tasting, and frying. The four friends scrounged up $900 to put a tiny stand in an East Hollywood parking lot. The menu was simple, and the chicken was the star. And what chicken it is! Sourced and prepared to be the juiciest and most tender imaginable with each piece topped with Dave’s own mix of spices ranging from No Spice to “The Reaper.”**  

  

**Arman created Instagram buzz and the lines began to grow. Two nights later, Eater/LA showed up to see what the fuss was about. The next morning's headline read ""East Hollywood's Late Night Chicken Stand Might Blow Your Mind."" Almost instantly, the lines stretched around the block.**  

  

**A year later, the boys had the money to open a shop in a hip strip-mall with décor by local street artists, where the crowds continued to grow with wait-times of an hour and more. From there, the incredibly craveable “Hot and Spicy” varieties have created a cult following with rave reviews across the U.S. and Canada.**

 **About Dave's Hot Chicken**  

  

**Dave’s Hot Chicken was created by best friends Dave Kopushyan, Arman Oganesyan, and Tommy and Gary Rubenyan. Dave, a chef trained in Thomas Keller’s (French Laundry) organization set out to create the perfect Hot Chicken by searching, tasting, and frying. The four friends scrounged up $900 to put a tiny stand in an East Hollywood parking lot. The menu was simple, and the chicken was the star. And what chicken it is! Sourced and prepared to be the juiciest and most tender imaginable with each piece topped with Dave’s own mix of spices ranging from No Spice to “The Reaper.”**  

  

**Arman created Instagram buzz and the lines began to grow. Two nights later, Eater/LA showed up to see what the fuss was about. The next morning's headline read ""East Hollywood's Late Night Chicken Stand Might Blow Your Mind."" Almost instantly, the lines stretched around the block.**  

  

**A year later, the boys had the money to open a shop in a hip strip-mall with décor by local street artists, where the crowds continued to grow with wait-times of an hour and more. From there, the incredibly craveable “Hot and Spicy” varieties have created a cult following with rave reviews across the U.S. and Canada.**
