Help us unleash human potential by removing the bottlenecks between user intent and action. In this role you will embed with a world-class, multi-disciplinary team of researchers and engineers to perform research into the use of neuromotor signals (i.e. electromyography or EMG) to power the next generation of interaction with the virtual and augmented world. Open research questions on the team span: human motor learning and control; the generation and propagation of the EMG signal; design and optimization of sensor array hardware; and the development of algorithms for processing sensor data to infer user intent using principles of signal processing, control theory, and human-computer interaction. Applicants with a broad range of relevant technical backgrounds, including experimental and theoretical approaches, and multidisciplinary interests, are encouraged to apply. Many of the research methods we employ are analogous to, or drawn from, domains such as artificial speech recognition, brain-machine interface design, computational neuroscience, and array signal processing as used in lidar, radar, sonar, and ultrasound applications. Our internships are twelve (12) to twenty four (24) weeks long, and we have various start dates throughout the year.  

  

  

### **Research Scientist Intern, Neuromotor Interfaces (PhD) Responsibilities:**

* Plan and execute cutting-edge applied research to advance neuromotor interface capabilities.
* Collaborate with engineering and Human-Computer Interactions (HCI) teams to translate fundamental scientific knowledge into new technology and user experiences.
* Use quantitative research methods to define, iterate upon and advance key areas of our research agenda.

  

  

  

### **Minimum Qualifications:**

* Currently has, or is in the process of obtaining, a PhD in systems or computational neuroscience, biophysics, physics, electrical engineering (e.g. signal processing, systems theory, control theory), statistics, applied math, computer science, or related fields.
* Must obtain work authorization in the country of employment at the time of hire and maintain ongoing work authorization during employment.
* Research-oriented implementation skills, including experience with scientific Python, as evidenced by academic or professional research experience or contributions to open source projects.

  

  

  

### **Preferred Qualifications:**

* Experience with scientific communication tools (jupyter, matplotlib).
* Experience designing experiments and creating new datasets.
* Experience working with neural data or other multi-channel timeseries sensor data.
* Familiarity with signal processing including real-time signal processing and sensor fusion.
* Familiarity with physical simulations of electromagnetic signal propagation, including biophysical simulations.
* Experience with multimodal recording systems (e.g. simultaneous measurement of physiology and behavior).
* Experience with research and engineering in industry.
* Intent to return to degree program after the completion of the internship.
