Faculty also serve as advisors in small advisory groups that meet daily. Advisors are responsible for supporting, advising, and mentoring students through their four years of high school, helping them to understand themselves as learners and to lead their fall and spring family conferences, and to contribute to student life and the school community.


In addition to teaching their core academic classes, all faculty teach in our Lab Studies program, focused on inquiry-driven, project-based, experiential real-world learning. Lab courses are team taught by faculty responsible for planning and co-constructing course content with their students.


Working closely with the class dean, school counselors, college counselor, learning specialist, and high school division head, teachers are part of a collaborative, team-based structure with a high level of communication and collegiality. Active participation in a faculty culture of continuous learning, professional development, and intellectual growth is expected and supported.

* Opportunities are available to coach, direct, and lead activities in the extracurricular program, in which all students are encouraged to participate.
* Bachelor’s degree required, master’s degree or doctorate preferred.
