**BCS partners with people to overcome obstacles on their pathway toward self-determination. Since 1866, founded on the principle of neighbors helping neighbors, BCS has worked in neighborhoods impacted by systemic poverty. Today, we continue to strengthen communities by fostering the educational success of children, the leadership development of youth, the employment and housing stability of adults, the advancement of individuals living with disabilities, and the empowerment of seniors and families. Our work is rooted in the struggle for social justice and through action and advocacy we commit to shine a light on barriers that perpetuate inequitable systems as a part of the collective effort to ignite change. BCS serves more than 20,000 people in 42+ programs through the work of approximately 400 staff and 900 volunteers.**

**Since March 2020, we have witnessed the compounding consequences of social isolation for young adults/youth with regard to education and mental health. Our young adults have experienced devastating learning loss and trauma against the backdrop of the pandemic. We are seeing higher rates of incidents relating to mental health challenges, frustrations from educational struggles and behavioral concerns in all of our after-school programs. Young people have fallen deeply behind in their academics and continue to try to process the trauma experienced in the last two years. Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) resources and staff training play a critical role in working with young adults, youth and parents. Trauma and grief/loss have been profound in our communities and with the families we serve. More than ever, specialized child/youth mental health services are needed to support students through this post-pandemic transition and return to normalcy. The stigma of mental health carries its own set of challenges in our communities; the ability to offer on-site clinical support will lessen the burden placed on struggling families to find support elsewhere.**

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/U--haul","http://www.uhaul.com/","2727 North Central Avenue

* **Analytical** - Synthesizes complex or diverse information; Collects and researches data; Uses intuition and experience to complement data; Designs workflows and procedures.
* **Deliver Legendary Service:** It’s all about the experience. With every experience, do the little things, as well as the big things, that surprise people. Make every interaction stand out for its helpfulness. Create the “WOW” factor that turns customers into raving fans. This includes both internal and external customers.
* **Do the Right Thing, Always:** Demonstrate an unwavering commitment to doing the right thing in every action you take and in every decision you make, *especially when no one’s looking*. Always tell the truth, no matter the consequences. If you make a mistake, own up to it, apologize, and make it right.
* **Practice Blameless Problem-Solving:** Demonstrate a relentless solution focus, rather than pointing fingers or dwelling on problems. Identify lessons learned and use those lessons to improve ourselves and our processes so we don’t make the same mistake twice. Get smarter with every mistake. Learn from every experience.
* **Contribute to Profit:** We’re in business to deliver value for our customers while making money. We all play a role in building revenue that exceeds our expenses. Look for ways to increase our sales, develop new customers, and control our expenses.
* **Honor Commitments:** Do what you say you’re going to do, when you say you’re going to do it. This includes being on time for all phone calls, appointments, and meetings. If a commitment can’t be fulfilled, notify others early and agree on a new deliverable to be honored.
* **Be a Fanatic About Response Time:** Respond to questions and concerns quickly, whether it’s in person, on the phone, or by e-mail. This includes simply acknowledging that we got the question and we’re “on it,” as well as keeping those involved continuously updated on the status of outstanding issues.
* **Embrace Change and Growth:** What got us here is not the same as what will get us to the next level. Get outside your comfort zone, rather than stubbornly hanging on to old ways of doing things. Be excited by the possibilities that change, and growth bring. Be flexible.
* **Be Positive:** You have the power to choose your attitude. Choose to be joyful, optimistic, and enthusiastic. See the good in others. Your attitude is contagious. Spread optimism and positive energy.
* **Do What’s Best for the Client:** In all situations, do what’s best for the client, even if it’s to our own short-term detriment. Put their needs ahead of our own. There’s no greater way to build a reputation than to steadfastly do what’s right for others. Every day.
* **When in Doubt, Communicate Personally:** When delivering difficult or complex messages, or in emotionally charged situations, speak “live” versus hiding behind e-mail or voicemail. Where appropriate, follow up in writing to confirm your understanding.
* **Invest in Relationships:** Get to know your clients and coworkers on a more personal level. Talk more and e-mail less. Understand what makes others tick and what’s important to them. Strong relationships enable us to more successfully work through difficult issues and challenging times.
* **Check Ego at the Door:** It’s not about you. Don’t let your ego get in the way of doing what’s best for the team. Worrying about who gets credit or taking things personally is counterproductive. Make sure every decision is based solely on advancing team goals and doing what’s best for the customer.
* **Be Easy to Work With:** Find ways to make working with you/us easier. Provide simple and complete instructions. When in doubt, do more for others rather than pushing the work back to them. Streamline our processes. Simplify everything. Be ridiculously helpful.
* **Treasure, Protect, and Promote our Reputation:** We’re all responsible for, and benefit from, our company’s image and reputation. Consider how your actions affect our collective reputation and be a proud ambassador for the company.
* **Debate, then Align:** Healthy, vigorous debate creates better solutions. Debate concepts without making personal attacks. Check your ego and push for the best solution, rather than your solution. Once a decision is made, however, get fully aligned by putting your complete support behind it.
* **Fix Problems at the Source:** Address issues by discovering the root cause rather than simply tackling the symptoms. It’s better to invest time in developing a long-term solution rather than simply applying a “Band-Aid.”
* **Get the Facts:** There’s always more to the story than you think. Learn to ask questions and gather the facts before jumping to conclusions and making judgments. Be curious about additional information that might yield a more complete picture.
* **Make Quality Personal:** Demonstrate a passion for excellence and take pride in the quality of everything you touch and everything you do. Have a healthy dislike for mediocrity. Good is not good enough. Always ask yourself, “Is this my best work?”
* **Walk in your Customer’s Shoes:** Understand your customers' world. Know their challenges and frustrations. See the world from their perspective. The better you understand them, the more effectively you can anticipate and meet their needs.
* **Get Clear on Expectations:** Create clarity and avoid misunderstandings by discussing expectations upfront. Set expectations for others and ask when you’re not clear on what they expect of you. End all meetings with clarity about action items, responsibilities, and due dates.
* **Listen to Understand:** Listening is more than simply “not speaking.” Give others your undivided attention. Be present and engaged. Minimize the distractions and let go of the need to agree or disagree. Suspend your judgment and be curious to know more, rather than jumping to conclusions.
* **Speak Straight:** Speak honestly in a way that helps to make progress. Say what you mean, and be willing to ask questions, share ideas, or raise issues that may cause conflict when it’s necessary for team success. Be courageous enough to say what needs to be said. Address issues directly with those who are involved or affected.
* **Find a Way:** Take personal responsibility for making things happen. Respond to every situation by looking for how we can do it, rather than explaining why it can’t be done. Be resourceful and show initiative. Don’t make excuses or wait for others to solve the problem. See issues through to their completion.
* **Show Meaningful Appreciation:** Recognize people doing things right, rather than pointing out when they do things wrong. Regularly extend *meaningful* acknowledgment and appreciation — in all directions throughout our organization.
* **Keep Things Fun:** While our passion for excellence is real, remember that the world has bigger problems than the daily challenges that make up our work. Stuff happens. Keep perspective. Don’t take things personally or take yourself too seriously. Laugh every day.

**POSITION SUMMARY**


Join Fountain House’s newest housing innovation—The Community Apartment Program (CAP). The CAP Mental Health Social Practitioner works to help the members of the apartment program live their lives to the fullest and develop independent living skills and social connections. We use community as our tool to do this, and the CAP Mental Health Social Practitioner will use group dinners as well as outings into the neighborhood to engage the 3-4 roommates in each apartment. The group will grow their social connections, hopefully become friends, and use consensus decision making to figure out how they want their apartment set-up. We want our members to have dignified homes and to feel comfortable in their apartment and to connect with the neighborhood.


This position requires interest in community, creativity, and flexibility. There will be no typical day in CAP, but if you could see yourself fostering relationships and connections to community for adults with mental illness by cooking group dinners, taking a group to the movies, assisting someone to learn how to do their laundry at the local laundromat, advocating at a social service provider, or helping one of your members to apply to a job in the community then this could be the position for you.


The CAP Mental Health Social Practitioner will be based at our clubhouse in Hell’s Kitchen and in the field at our scattered site apartments. They will work 9 am to 5 pm three days a week and 11 am to 7 pm twice each week. The evening shifts will allow them to cook dinner with their members. During the dinner they will assess the apartment for repairs, engage with the members and support their increase in socialization, social networks, and decrease loneliness and isolation. The Social Practitioner will have one paperwork day that can be taken at home. They will attend a weekly team meeting to brainstorm how to better support members and be appraised of ongoing issues. They are expected to become part of our community.

**Shift:** This is a full-time, in-person position, Monday to Friday.

**Salary:** $29.12 per hour


Requirements:
**ESSENTIAL DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES**

* Support a member list of 8 individuals living with severe and persistent mental illness to achieve their goals, avoid isolation, and connect to work, school and community.
* Provide one-on-one support with individuals living in the Community Apartment Program, including weekly in person face-to-face meetings.
* Cook dinner with residents at the members’ apartment and facilitate their connection to each other and the community at large.
* Engage members in each apartment to decorate and clean so that their housing is as dignified as possible and encourages interaction. The Housing Social Practitioner will use social design to create opportunities for comfort and socializing even when they are not present with the members.
* Provide support outside the apartment in the community so that members feel comfortable at their local laundromat, grocery store, pharmacy, etc. and engage the members in social events in the community.
* Ensure that the apartment passes necessary health and safety checks for maintenance, cleanliness and perform monthly fire drills.
* Create Individualized Service Plans and Service Plan Reviews regularly, according to duration of services.
* Develop strong relationships with building management to advocate for members to maintain safe and dignified apartments.
* Facilitate discharge planning both for when members move out, but also for when a group of members desire to transition their apartment from this program to a more independent level of support.
* Find the positive goals that members have, and engage with them to pursue school, work, and social activity.

***Administrative Duties***

* Maintain and update files according to New York State Office of Mental Health (OMH) guidelines.

### **Our Core Values**


**More Than a School** At PAVE, we are more than a school, we are a family. Staff members, families and community organizations work together in unity to create a warm, safe and joyful learning environment, where students can blossom into the best version of themselves.


**No Limits** At PAVE, the possibilities are endless, and we will not settle for less than our best. PAVE classrooms focus deeply on the growth and achievement in all aspects of our students' academic and social development. We maintain high expectations for our students and for ourselves and commit to providing the care, coaching, and communication needed for students and staff to learn, grow, and shine.


**Bright Starts, Vibrant Futures** At PAVE, our classrooms are bright in aesthetic and vibrant with learning. Our teachers and students engage with one another enthusiastically and embrace the challenge and rigor of the work with joy. Fun is not an add on; it is an essential component of the PAVE experience. We believe that a life and love of learning starts here.


**Love is Justice** At PAVE, we acknowledge that systemic racism and bias has had its grips on our community for far too long. We create inclusive and equitable spaces where everyone belongs, everyone matters, and everyone is loved. ""Hate cannot drive out Hate. Only Love can do that."" We endeavor to bring out the best in our students and each other by, with, and through love. This, we believe, is justice in action.


**Lift Every Voice** At PAVE, every voice matters. We value diverse perspectives and insights within our community. We encourage our students to engage with one another and express themselves with both power and respect. As our students prepare to enter the world beyond PAVE, it is our responsibility to ensure that our students are equipped and empowered to use their voice effectively to advocate for themselves and others.
