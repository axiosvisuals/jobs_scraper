**International Graduate Trainee Program - Claims Track**

* Applicants requiring employer sponsorship of a visa nor or in the future will not be considered for this position.

  

As one of the world's leading reinsurance companies, Munich Re is dedicated to training all employees to reach the highest levels of insurance and reinsurance knowledge and to bringing that knowledge and expertise to our clients. The International Graduate Trainee Program is one way of accomplishing this critical goal. This selective, experience-based program offers comprehensive training for recent college graduates via three core components: foundational classroom training, hands-on rotational assignments and industry exams. Further details on each component are below.

  

Trainees will be paired with a Sponsor Claims team at the start of their 2 year program; upon successful completion of the 2 year program, Trainees will then join that Sponsor team as a fulltime Claims Specialist. The Sponsor team will be determined by the Company based on business need and an assessment of the match between a Trainee’s skillset and personality relative to a Sponsor team’s work and culture.

  



Hear more about the opportunity from Claims Trainees here: https://youtu.be/pWERZf3580U. Learn more about the Trainee Program here: https://youtu.be/CuHNbPDk6-w.

 **PROGRAM CORE COMPONENTS:**

* **Classroom training**

  

Trainees will spend approximately 10% of their time in a classroom setting, learning about core business functions from internal subject matter experts. Trainees are expected to actively participate in and initiate classroom discussions, read related course material as requested, and utilize the knowledge gained during their rotations.

* **Rotational Assignments**

  

Trainees will spend approximately 90% of their time gaining hands-on experience about core business functions from internal subject matter experts. Rotations last anywhere from a few days to several months, and may take place in any of our domestic office locations. Trainees will also have the opportunity to spend time in one of our international offices and network with their global peers. During rotations, Trainees are expected to develop an appreciation for and understanding of the different business functions, always with an eye towards recognizing opportunities for future collaboration and efficiency once in their fulltime Claims role post-program.

* **Industry Exams**

  

Trainees are required to continue their education through the passing of relevant industry exams, outside of work time. This is in direct alignment with our corporate culture of continuous learning and improvement. Trainees will work directly with the Trainee Program Manager to identify appropriate exams, which may include the Property & Casualty Adjuster License exam, the Reinsurance Association of America Re Scholar program, the Institutes’ Chartered Property Casualty Underwriter (CPCU) exams, the CLM Claims College, and/or the CLM Litigation Management Institute, among others.

 **Qualifications:**

  

Successful candidates will possess the following skills/capabilities:

  

* Bachelor’s or Master’s degree (graduation Dec 2024 or May 2025) in Risk Management, Insurance, Legal Studies, Actuarial Science, Math, Statistics, Economics, Finance, Accounting, Business Administration, Business Analytics or other related field
* GPA 3.25 and above

* Innate curiosity and self-motivation
* Flexible working style, able to work independently, with in-person colleagues and as part of remote teams
* Demonstrated leadership abilities in college or community activities
* Prior internships (at least one internship with meaningful degree of responsibility)

  

Claims Trainees will begin fulltime claims roles after successful completion of the Graduate Trainee Program. They should be interested in and prepared to work either with our reinsurance team out of our Princeton, NJ office, or with one of our specialty insurance teams out of our Princeton, NJ, Chicago, IL, Philadelphia, PA or Atlanta, GA offices. Applicants should disclose their preferences during the interview process, such that we may align interests with business needs in advance.

  

At Munich Re, we see Diversity, Equity and Inclusion as a solution to the challenges and opportunities all around us. Our goal is to foster an inclusive culture and build a workforce that reflects the customers we serve and the communities in which we live and work.

**Our Commitment Statement to Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, & Belonging**



At Chicory, diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging are key ingredients in our recipe for success. Our diverse experiences, backgrounds, identities, and ways of thinking elevate the level at which we operate; this allows us to innovate in old-school industries by looking not at how things have been done, but how they should be done. We are building a workplace built on merit and equity where every one of us has a voice at the table.  

  

**Our Values**


* **Operate with Empathy**
* **Embrace Individuality**
* **THINK**
* **Make Chicory Fun!**


**Our Principles**


* **Be Good People:** We bring the best out of each other by being good to each other. We operate with empathy, respect and integrity. We balance confidence with humility. We believe we can build a great company and have fun doing it.
* **Seek to Understand:** Leaders seek first to understand, then to be understood. Instead of
* demanding things of others, or throwing orders around, we ask probing questions to understand where others are coming from. Leaders are collaborative and strive to solve problems together.
* **Own It:** Leaders are owners. They take full responsibility for their areas of the business. They actively seek out ways to make improvements and create efficiencies. They catch and fix issues before they are pointed out to them. They don't take the role of bystander. They take pride in the work that they do.
* **Bias for Action:** Time will always be the limiting factor and indecision stifles progress. Most decisions are reversible. Leaders act today instead of waiting until tomorrow. The biggest mistake we can make is to be afraid of making mistakes.
* **Separate Your Ego From Your Position:** Great leaders actively seek out reality and are willing to change their stance. They promote positive conflict and let the best decisions come to light, even if it may cause them pain. They can admit when they are wrong and commit wholeheartedly to decisions once they are made. They fight for the greater good of the company, not themselves.
* **Hold High Standards:** The quality of products, services and processes determines the speed at which we can operate. Leaders set high standards for themselves and their teams. They hold these standards with conviction and actively communicate when they are not being met.
* **Have a Beginner's Mind:** Just because something has been done a certain way doesn't mean it's the best way. We actively take moments out of our day to reflect on the past, present and future. This allows us to look at each challenge with a fresh perspective and welcome viewpoints that challenge the status quo.
* **Be Deliberate:** Great leaders are intentional with their words and actions. We are direct. We avoid overcomplication. We strive to accomplish more with less.
* **Expand Your Knowledge:** Leaders have a deep understanding of the business and the industry we operate in. They know how their skills impact their role, how their role impacts the business and how the business impacts the industry. They take time to read the world to anticipate the future. They are always improving themselves and those around them.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Chicory","https://www.chicoryapp.com","New York","2 to 10","","","","","",""
