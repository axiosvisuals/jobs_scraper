* Ability to work independently and as part of a team in a fast-paced, dynamic environment.
* Excellent communication skills, both written and verbal, with the ability to present complex data insights to non-technical stakeholders.
* **Minimum of 5 years of experience in hands-on sales**, **with a focus on SaaS and e-commerce companies.**
* Strong organizational skills and the ability to manage multiple projects simultaneously
* Strong analytical and problem-solving skills with a keen attention to detail.


The OTE compensation for this position is $180,000-$200,000/year with an option to **over-achieve**. The base pay offered may vary depending on job-related knowledge, skills, and experience.


**WHO WE ARE**



At Eko, we're hiring people, not just skills. If you possess some of the qualities we're looking for but not all, and still feel you're a great fit, we encourage you to apply. At eko, we believe in a creative approach to everything, no matter what role we're in. We believe in meaningful choice, both at work and in life, and know our workplace only gets better when people can bring their whole selves to the office. We have offices in NYC, TLV, and an AI-powered Robotic studio in Bentonville. We're software developers and spray paint artists, poets and producers, fantasy sports fans and financial whizzes, chess-heads and UXperts, pop culture nerds and product managers, data wizards and yoga instructors. We're passionate about art, entertainment, technology and everything in between. It's our unique mix of talents and passions that puts us at the forefront of interactive video.
