The Center for Justice Innovation is a community justice organization that centers safety and racial justice. Since our founding in 1996, the Center has partnered with community members, courts, and the people most impacted to create stronger, healthier, more just communities. Our decades of experience in courts and communities, coupled with our field-leading research and practitioner expertise, help us drive justice nationwide in innovative, powerful, and durable ways. For more information on how and where we work, please visit www.innovatingjustice.org.


The Center is a 900-employee, $100 million nonprofit that accomplishes its vision through three pillars of work: creating and scaling operating programs to test new ideas and solve problems, performing original research to determine what works (and what doesn’t), and providing expert assistance and policy guidance to justice reformers around the world.

**Operating Programs**


The Center’s operating programs, including the award-winning Red Hook Community Justice Center and Midtown Community Justice Center, test new ideas, solve difficult problems, and attempt to achieve systemic change within the justice system. Our projects include community-based violence prevention programs, alternatives to incarceration, reentry initiatives, and court-based initiatives that reduce the use of unnecessary incarceration and promote positive individual and family change. Through this programming, we have produced tangible results like safer streets, reduced incarceration, and improved neighborhood perceptions of justice.

**Research**


The Center's research teams are staffed with social scientists, data analysts, and lawyers who are academically-trained or have lived experience and who conduct research in the U.S. and globally on diverse criminal-legal system and justice issues. Their work includes evaluating programs and policies; conducting exploratory, community-based studies; and providing research translation and strategic planning for system actors. The Center has published studies on topics including court and jail reform, intimate partner violence, restorative justice, gun violence, reentry, sixth amendment rights, and progressive prosecution. The research teams strive to make their work meaningful and actionable to the communities they work with, policymakers, and practitioners.

**Policy & Expert Assistance**


The Center provides hands-on, planning and implementation assistance to a wide range of jurisdictions in areas of reform such as problem-solving courts (e.g., community courts, treatment courts, domestic violence courts), tribal justice, reducing incarceration and the use of fines/fees and reducing crime and violence. Our current expert assistance takes many forms, including help with analyzing data, strategic planning and consultation, policy guidance, and hosting site visits to its operating programs in the New York City area.

**Center Support**


A dedicated support team within the Center ensures the smooth functioning of operations across various domains, including finance, legal, technology, human resources, fundraising, real estate, and communications. Comprising 15% of the organization's staff, these teams provide essential infrastructure support and innovative solutions aligned with the Center's mission and values.

**THE OPPORTUNITY**


The Center's Technology Support and Strategy Department supports technology needs across our rapidly growing organization of approximately 800 staff working on geographically and technologically diverse projects. While much of our infrastructure is hosted and maintained in partnership with New York State's Office of Court Administration, we support our staff in its software and hardware needs and own and manage Google Suite and other systems, all while being thought leaders and innovators in using technology in criminal justice reform.


This is an exciting opportunity for someone looking to get real, hands-on experience in an enterprise I.T. environment. This is a long-term apprenticeship and very different from a summer internship.

We want you to learn as much as you can and develop all the skills you need to start your professional career. You will be trained and guided while being an equal contributing member within the team. The ideal candidate should be enthusiastic and open to learning various technologies and concepts. You will have an abundance of help and guidance from all the Tech team members. How much you learn and grow will be up to you.

**Responsibilities include but are not limited to:**

* Shadow technicians to learn and apply troubleshooting for common tech issues and requests;
* Prepare and image desktops and laptops;
* Perform and maintain inventory of Tech assets at various sites and operating projects;
* Participate in various tech projects;
* Troubleshoot issues with various hardware, software, and the network;
* Prepare documentation of processes and procedures;
* Attend meetings and take minutes;
* Troubleshoot the network, server equipment; and
* Additional relevant tasks as needed;

**Qualifications:** The ideal candidate will be:

* A college Junior or rising Junior pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Information Systems, Information Technology or relevant technical area at an accredited college or university;
* Able to commit at least 20 hours per week;
* Excellent analytical, judgement and problem-solving skills;
* Strong verbal and written communication skills;
* Extremely collaborative with the ability to thrive in a team environment;
* Basic understanding of computer hardware, networking, and Microsoft Office software;
* Basic understanding of Windows 10 and MacOS operating systems;
* Ability to prioritize and manage multiple streams of information and tasks;
* Strong attention to detail and strong sense of accountability;

**Position Type:** Part-time, 20 hours per week, 3 days a week in person.

**Position Location:** Midtown Manhattan, with occasional travel within the 5 boroughs and Newark, NJ.

**Compensation:** The salary range starts at $23 to $25 per hour and is commensurate with experience, preference to a current Junior or rising Junior.

We are committed to fostering an inclusive and diverse workplace, and as such, we do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, national origin, age, military service eligibility, veteran status, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, or any other category protected by law.

Our aim is to create a supportive and respectful environment where every individual, irrespective of their background or identity, feels valued and included.


As of February 10, 2023, New York City Executive Order 25 rescinded the requirement of the COVID-19 vaccination for City workers, new hires, and contracted employees. Accordingly, the Center does not require all new hires be vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus; however, the Center recommends all staff, interns, and volunteers stay up-to-date on the vaccination.

The **MOMS** Partnership Model is an evidence-based approach to maternal mental health for under-resourced families. It includes a series of interventions focused on stress management and parenting skills, which are provided in eight-week cycles to small cohorts of women. These courses are informed by cognitive behavioral therapy and aim to build skills for changing mood and behavior.

Elsewhere is a multi-room Brooklyn music venue and nightclub built by and for the culture-obsessed – an events collective with deep roots in NYC's underground music community. We are here to empower artists, celebrate the diversity of our city, widen access to visionary and uplifting culture and experience the joy of doing it all together.


If you share our passion for music and art without boundaries, and you're looking for the challenge of
  

your career, we want to connect with you - join us and grow with one of the best teams in independent arts, hospitality, events, and culture.


**Job Description**


Elsewhere is seeking an empathetic and detail-oriented leader to manage our Event Security team. The Head of Event Security will play a crucial role in maintaining the safety of our patrons, staff, and venue during events. This position involves overseeing security operations, enforcing policies, and ensuring effective communication with key stakeholders.


**R****esponsibilities include but are not limited to****…**


**Onsite Schedule**


The Head of Event Security will work four shifts per week, including high-priority events on Fridays and Saturdays. In cases of last-minute call-outs or no-shows, you will be responsible for ensuring coverage, either by arranging it yourself or delegating this task to a Security Supervisor if necessary.


**Onsite Responsibilities**


You will be responsible for training new security guards, ensuring they are fully prepared to perform their duties independently. This includes conducting pre-shift briefings to communicate event-specific details and maintaining regular communication with Managers on Duty (MOD) to ensure smooth event operations.


Your role also involves enforcing venue rules, both for security staff and patrons, and assigning security posts as needed for each event. In your absence, you will train Security Supervisors to make these decisions. You will supervise all security personnel during shifts, enforce security protocols, and manage the distribution, tracking, and collection of security equipment.


In collaboration with the EMT company, you will assist in managing customers in distress and support MODs in preparing incident reports, as well as liaising with law enforcement when necessary. Monitoring patron behavior and level of intoxication is also key, as is the ability to de-escalate potentially aggressive situations. Communication with the Director of Venue Operations, GM, and Assistant GM/Safety
  

Manager regarding any issues during operating hours is essential.


**Core Responsibilities**


In addition to your onsite duties, you will regularly assess potential threats and take proactive measures to address them. You will work closely with all departments to foster inclusion, uphold company values, and provide constructive feedback. Legal and compliance duties include providing necessary documentation for investigations and attending depositions when required.


You will also participate in security walkthroughs for events requiring additional planning, such as private or high-profile events, and meet with NYPD as needed to address safety concerns.


**Office Schedule & Responsibilities**


Your office responsibilities include a mix of remote work and in-person meetings. On Mondays, you will work from home and respond to staffing inquiries to facilitate payroll review. Every Wednesday, you will attend a weekly meeting with the GM/Safety Manager to review and finalize the event schedule for the next two weeks, discuss any necessary staffing adjustments, and ensure all security guard training and certification processes are on track.


**Quarterly and Annual Responsibilities**


Each quarter, you will attend and help facilitate a security team meeting, guiding the team in voicing concerns and strategizing improvements. On an ongoing basis, you will assist with the recruitment, hiring, and onboarding of new security team members, ensuring all eligibility requirements are met. You will also monitor and renew security guard licenses and certifications as needed.


**P****erformance Management & Termination**


You will enforce company policies related to disciplinary actions and terminations, ensuring all steps are documented and communicated to HR. If an employee is involved in criminal activity or dangerous practices, you have the authority to send them home immediately, with termination following the next day. All other disciplinary actions should be properly documented and coordinated with HR and the GM.


**Compensation & Personnel Complaints**


Requests for raises, either personal or for team members, should be submitted in writing to your Manager, with approvals managed by HR and the GM. Personnel complaints should be addressed openly and respectfully, with documentation maintained to track performance issues and feedback.


**Expectations**


As the Head of Event Security, you are expected to maintain open communication with all leadership teams and ensure that all security personnel adhere to Elsewhere’s values and standards. Respectful feedback is encouraged across all levels, and you will be held accountable for fostering this culture within the security team.


* **Y****ou’ll love your time at Elsewhere because****…**
* We believe in what we do, and foster a culture of respect (for all music & people), passion, and excellence
* You will work with teammates that are the best in the culture & events business
* You will be on the cutting edge of music, enabling emerging culture to thrive
* We are building a long-term business, that can support long-term careers in our Industry

**Compensation and Benefits**


* $75,000 per year
* Medical, dental, and vision benefits
* Commuter benefits
* 401k
* Unlimited Vacation

**Elsewhere’s Values**
  

These values are real and guide all of our decisions in how we operate and how we treat people. This includes our decisions to hire, reward, and fire. Every single person at Elsewhere will be held to these standards. This is how we build a great team, achieve our goals, and do so enjoyably.


* **Respect** for all people, music, and ideas – be open-minded. Elsewhere is no place for hatred or discrimination for any kind, as a workplace or as a venue. This standard applies to everyone, not just staff, including artists, audiences, investors, etc.


* **Inclusivity:** We believe that music and people should not be siloed, and that Elsewhere is best enjoyed when we are all together.


* **Creativity:** We support creativity on stage but we are also creative as a company. It is better to take a smart creative risk and fail than to avoid taking creative risks at all.


* **Service:** Go above and beyond in doing what is best for our artists and for our audiences so they can

have an incredible event. You might do this every day, but for them, this event might be a very rare and special occasion.
* **Excellence:** We are values-driven but performance-oriented. Work smart over hard, but do the hard things when you need to instead of just what’s easy.

CFR was originally founded in 2002 to dramatically change the trajectory of indigent parents being prosecuted by the Citys Administration for Childrens Services (ACS). Our goal is to defend and protect our clients rights, reduce the harm of family separation and prevent or minimize the time any child spends in the foster system.


CFR provides interdisciplinary family defense with a model that was unique at our founding and that is now being replicated nationally: we assign every client an attorney and a social work staff member, and teams have the support of parent advocates, who are parents with direct personal experience of being investigated and prosecuted by ACS. CFR was the first agency in the country to integrate parents with lived experience into legal teams and now has 7 parent advocates working in all three of our family defense locations. CFRsCommunity Advocacy Projectrepresents parents during a child protective investigation (to avoid court involvement where possible) and assists parents in clearing their names from state maltreatment records.


As an agency committed to securing justice for families, we built theYouth Defense practice (YDP)to defend youth at risk of family separation through incarceration. YDP uses the same interdisciplinary model to represent youth being prosecuted in Queens and Manhattan in Supreme Court Youth Parts, during Probation Adjustment and in Delinquency proceedings in Family Court. CFRs Home for Good program provides legal and social work services to CFR clients inimmigration,civil legal servicesandcriminal defensematters, to afford clients an efficient and well-coordinated one-stop solution to a range of issues that threaten family stability.
