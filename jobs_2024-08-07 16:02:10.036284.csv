**Be fit. Change lives. Have fun.**  

  

**A little quiz:** What do Batman and Robin, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Hermoine Granger and Harry Potter, and Venus and Serena Williams have in common?  

  

**Answer**: Each member of the pair makes the other stronger.  

  

That’s how it is with an Orangetheory Studio Manager and Assistant Studio Manager (ASM). They’re a doublet, a duo, a dyad. And while the manager is ultimately in charge, without that able-bodied sidekick, the studio wouldn’t run nearly as smoothly.  

  

So if you’d like to be half of such a pair, to know the ropes as well as you know your members’ names, to step in when your manager steps out, to balance each other’s strengths, to set goals and surpass them...then Orangetheory just might be looking for you.  

  

**We Offer**
  

* We provide substantial paid training, certifications, and support to ensure your success
* Compensation includes competitive base pay and commission.
* Free Studio Membership with a required 2 OTF classes at the Forest Hills Location
* Product discounts
* Flexible schedule that works around educational or personal goals
* Fitness casual dress-code
* Passionate, collaborative work environment
* The opportunity to learn every aspect of the business to eventually other management opportunities

**Here’s more of what the position entails:**  

* Greeting everyone who enters the studio with enthusiasm, energy and knowledge
* Presenting the OTF concept to any interested consumers, also known as “intros” while working hand in hand with the coaches
* Giving studio tours
* Selling memberships to help the studio thrive
* Leading and developing fellow staff members while on shift
* Following up on prospective clients to book their first OTF classes
* Handling members’ concerns in a professional and objective manner with the goal of resolution
* Participating in marketing and outreach events
* Ensuring all areas of the studio are kept clean and organized
* Participating in 1 staff meeting per month for further development

  

Every day will be different, but you’ll be representing the Orangetheory brand as you share the science of this workout you want everyone to love as much as you do.  

Maybe you’ll use this post as a stepping stone in your management career, or perhaps this is where you want to be forever. But if you’ve been at even one Orangetheory class, you feel the warmth, the enthusiasm, the genuine sense of being where you need to be — feelings you’ll be hard-pressed to find anywhere but here.  

  

Specific job duties and selection requirements vary between Orangetheory studio locations and more details can be provided by the studio’s hiring manager if you are selected to move forward in the interview process.

About Us:

Diáfano is the language learning hub of the future, with human-centered philosophy at its very core. The Diáfano Method fuses tried and true methods of language learning with our own modern spin. Designed by a linguist and administered by a global community of top-tier native educators, our method hacks into the psychology of language learning to ensure maximum retention and true mastery.

Our Goal:

We empower people to immerse themselves in new cultures and create meaningful connections through language learning. We believe that language learning leads to cross-cultural understanding, so we aim to make it more accessible and more impactful than ever. Our goal is to help students achieve language mastery through methods focused on social learning. We rely on data to inform progress and our decision-making process, all while engaging in culturally-responsive pedagogy. As a teacher, your job is as much to teach about the language as it is to teach its cultural context and help to continue to build a culturally competent and understanding society.

Our Core Values:

* Mastery: We strive for mastery in everything that we do.
* Sincerity: Integrity means a lot to us. It is at the core of who we are.
* Innovation: We create our own rules to give you an experience and results you won’t find anywhere else.
* Inclusivity: We are driven to create classes that are culturally-relevant and driven. We believe in inclusivity from the teachers we hire to the courses we teach.
* Connection: We care about people, first and foremost. We always create a nurturing environment that supports bonding, connection, and growth.
