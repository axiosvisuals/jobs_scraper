With initiatives around sustainability and transparency, we are aligning our corporate mission to a greater sense of responsibility and purpose.



We are a growing global leader in the food and beverage industry seeking new talent to achieve our mission! Our culture and core values foster individual professional growth. Looking to make an impact? We reward entrepreneurial spirit and teamwork.

**Why do we exist?** The Mission and Sustainability (M&S) team develops and enables the implementation of all of Danone North America’s mission and sustainability efforts. To deliver on Danone’s mission to bring health through food to as many people as possible, we must connect several integrated impact efforts across:

* Health (e.g., nutrition, transparent and responsible marketing, positive impact of food on health, etc.)
* Communities (e.g., human rights, thriving communities, future skilling our value chain, etc.)

  



The M&S team provides strategic oversight, direction, and governance across these topics for Danone North America and ensures a deep collaboration with our Global Danone counterparts. We partner with multiple cross-functional internal stakeholders (e.g., procurement, sales, research and innovation, etc.) and external stakeholders to deliver on our strategy. The team is integrated into the heart of the business and sits within the Enterprise Strategy and Transformation Team (ES&T) in North America.

This means understanding current and future trends and mission-critical needs across the planet, our health, and our communities where Danone North America can make a difference. We use this strategic insight to prioritize commitments and programs that have the highest impact through deep analyses of costs, risks, ROI, feasibility, and tradeoffs.

  



PLAN, DO, AND REVIEW –



We collaborate with teams across Danone North America (e.g., procurement, sales, research and innovation, scientific affairs, HR, marketing, etc.) to develop and implement roadmaps for our impact programs. We identify short- and long-term milestones, resourcing plans, clear business ownership and accountability mechanisms. We also identify a simple and streamlined set of targets/goals, and actionable and measurable KPIs for tracking progress that are balanced to respond to both business and impact needs. We provide subject matter expertise and technical expertise to large-scale, cross-functional projects that often span research and innovation, sourcing, supply chain, etc. and a multitude of topics such as circularity, regenerative agriculture, healthy living, and affordability of and access to nutritious foods. We set up mechanisms to measure and report on our impact so that we can constantly refine our strategy and programs to deliver the highest impact. We stay in constant contact with our Global Sustainability Team to ensure that our work and impact “ladders up” to the broader mission and impact priorities of Danone.

The Care Coordinator is a critical role designed to facilitate and enhance telemedicine services, including Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) and Chronic Care Management (CCM), for patients residing in Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNF). This position serves as the pivotal link between the patients in the SNF and the remote clinical team of a third-party provider, focusing exclusively on managing and coordinating telemedicine care programs. The Care Coordinator does not perform duties within the SNF itself but rather works on behalf of a third-party company to ensure effective and successful delivery of care through telemedicine services.

  


**Responsibilities**



Act as the primary liaison between SNF patients and the remote clinical team, coordinating telemedicine services such as RPM and CCM.



Facilitate the creation and implementation of patient-centered care plans by working closely with remote healthcare providers, specifically tailored to telemedicine frameworks.



Ensure continuous monitoring and assessment of patient conditions, coordinating the flow of vital data between the SNF and the remote clinical team.



Educate and support both patients and SNF staff on the effective use of telemedicine programs, promoting optimal management of chronic conditions and healthcare outcomes.



Advocate for the patient’s needs, ensuring they receive comprehensive and effective care through the telemedicine programs.



Bridge communication and operational gaps between SNF staff and the remote clinical team to ensure seamless delivery of telemedicine services.



Manage and maintain patient records, ensuring accurate and timely communication of health data between the SNF and the remote clinical team.



Monitor and evaluate patient progress within telemedicine programs, working collaboratively with all parties to adjust care plans and interventions for better health outcomes.


**Qualifications**



Certification as a Medical Assistant or in a related healthcare field.



Experience in telemedicine, RPM, or CCM programs, with a strong understanding of care coordination within these settings.



Demonstrated ability to communicate effectively and coordinate between patients, healthcare providers, and facility staff.



Strong organizational and multitasking skills, with the capacity to manage complex care programs and detailed patient data.



Proficiency in electronic medical records (EMR) and telemedicine platforms, with a high level of digital literacy.



Knowledgeable in medical terminology, chronic condition management, and the specific requirements of telemedicine care delivery.



Independent worker with team collaboration skills, committed to enhancing patient care and outcomes through effective telemedicine coordination.


**Ideal Candidate**



The ideal candidate is a dynamic and empathetic professional, skilled in navigating the nuances of telemedicine and adept at coordinating care between remote clinical teams and patients in SNFs. This role is perfect for someone passionate about leveraging technology to improve healthcare delivery and patient outcomes in a telemedicine setting.

**Assistant General Manager**

Nowon is looking for an AGM with extensive service experience, beverage and culinary knowledge. We are passionate about creating a fun atmosphere for guests while serving the best Korean-American Gastropub fare in NYC. We are a company that values both individual and team growth.

Candidates should possess a drive to excel during service hours, constantly refining operating procedures to work efficiently while leveraging past experiences and insights.

We are sincere in our efforts to be a part of our community and make Nowon a lively gathering place for our guests with our team as their hosts.

This is a full-time position with responsibilities that include oversight of daily services, inventory, maintenance of facilities, opening and/or closing shifts and upholding company standards which follow all guidelines laid out by Nowon.

If you’re self motivated, self disciplined, love being in a rapidly evolving work environment and want to be part of a dynamic team that thrives on building relationships with our guests, each other, and the community, then we want to hear from you!

* Excellent communication skills are necessary to succeed in this position, as well as having compassion and skills at engaging seniors and getting them to their appointments on time! The most important and essential aspect of this job is developing a good relationship with each client so that on the day of their appointment, it is seamless for you to find them and escort them to the therapy office.
* We will provide you with all necessary training and support! The only thing you need to bring is your amazing personality! You will need to complete a NYS certification as a Peer Specialist. This credentialing *does not* require you to have a mental illness or substance abuse problem; simply having overcome a major life event (death in the family, COVID, emotional hardship) is the only requirement.
* The essential goal is for the clinician to see clients back-to-back throughout the day with no downtime in-between sessions.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Serenity-Center","","","","","","","","",""
