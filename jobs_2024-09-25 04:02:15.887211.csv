### **Location**

New York, NY
### **Open Date**

Sep 24, 2024
### **Description**

New York University seeks applicants for a faculty position in Computational Biophysics, which will be a 50/50 joint appointment between the Department of Biology and the Department of Physics. This position is part of a multi-year Integrated Science Initiative that will build on NYU’s collaborative culture by recruiting faculty whose research makes explicit connections between departments and promises synergistic advances in fields ripe for cross-boundary breakthroughs.  



The Department of Biology is a highly interdisciplinary and collaborative research enterprise whose research and teaching spans from molecular and cellular biology through organismal biology to evolution, ecology and the impact of environmental change. Within the Physics Department, we anticipate that the new faculty member will join the Center for Soft Matter Research (CSMR). The CSMR currently has ten faculty members pursuing research at the interface between physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering, using laboratory, theoretical, and computational tools. By hiring in the overlap between Biology and CSMR, we seek to build programs in cross-disciplinary research areas such as quantitative biology, systems biology, neurophysics and the physics of the origin of life. More information about current research programs in the Department of Physics and its centers can be found online at https://physics.as.nyu.edu, and for the Department of Biology at https://biology.as.nyu.edu/.  



The opening is at the rank of tenure-track Assistant Professor. A successful candidate should have a Ph.D. in Physics, Biology, Biophysics or a related field and an ability to conduct original research that is documented by peer-reviewed publications. Previous experience in teaching and outreach is highly desirable. The candidate will be expected to teach in both the Biology and Physics Departments at the undergraduate and graduate level, with the equivalent of half the standard load in each department. The appointment can begin as early as September 1, 2025, pending administrative and budgetary approval.  



Arts and Science lies at the heart of a leading research university that spans the globe. We seek scholars of the highest caliber that embody the diversity of the United States as well as the global society in which we live. We strongly encourage applications from women, racial and ethnic minorities, and other individuals who are under-represented in the profession, across color, creed, race, ethnic and national origin, physical ability, gender and sexual identity, or any other legally protected basis. NYU affirms the value of differing perspectives on the world as we strive to build the strongest possible university with the widest reach. To learn more about the FAS commitment to diversity, equality, and inclusion, see: https://as.nyu.edu/departments/facultydiversity.html.  



Pay Transparency Statement In compliance with NYC’s Pay Transparency Act, the annual base salary range for this position is $89,000 - $129,000. New York University considers factors such as (but not limited to) the scope and responsibilities of the position, the candidate’s work experience, education/training, key skills, internal peer equity, as well as market and organizational considerations when extending an offer.

**Empower Every New Yorker — Without Exception — to Live the Healthiest Life Possible**


NYC Health + Hospitals is the largest public health care system in the United States. We provide essential outpatient, inpatient and home-based services to more than one million New Yorkers every year across the city’s five boroughs. Our large health system consists of ambulatory centers, acute care centers, post-acute care/long-term care, rehabilitation programs, Home Care, and Correctional Health Services. Our diverse workforce is uniquely focused on empowering New Yorkers, without exception, to live the healthiest life possible.


At NYC Health + Hospitals, our mission is to deliver high quality care health services, without exception. Every employee takes a person-centered approach that exemplifies the ICARE values (Integrity, Compassion, Accountability, Respect, and Excellence) through empathic communication and partnerships between all persons.


**Job Description**
-------------------

  


SUMMARY OF ESSENTIAL DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:  

Patients transitioning out of the acute inpatient care setting—including those discharged to home, shelter, or skilled nursing settings, among others—remain among the most vulnerable to experiencing fragmentation and gaps in care, increasing risk for preventable adverse outcomes and downstream costs of care. Safety net hospitals and health systems face unique challenges in delivering effective transitional care in the post-inpatient period, serving a patient population with an overall higher risk of readmission and greater unmet behavioral health, economic, housing and social needs. Meeting these needs requires strong collaboration, coordination, integration, and management of care planning and delivery across disciplines within and beyond the hospital inpatient setting and outside the health care sector.


Across NYC Health + Hospitals, the Transitional Care Management (TCM) program is a standardized and systemwide program that aims to support successful transitions for high-risk patients from hospital inpatient to community settings. Within the program, Transitional Care Coordinators (TCCs) and Transitional Care Managers work collaboratively alongside interdisciplinary teams to perform transitional care activities, including in both discharge planning and post-discharge monitoring phases. During the inpatient admission, the patient is screened for root causes of admission, unmet medical or social needs, and other re-admission risks. Staff then work with patients, outpatient caregivers and providers, and the inpatient interdisciplinary team to develop and implement a care plan customized to the patient’s needs. Upon discharge, transitional care staff monitor the patient with regular callbacks for 30 days post-discharge. Though operationalized by staff embedded within care teams at each acute care hospital, the TCM program is a systemwide program leveraging standardized operational guidance, workforce training, program policies, and monitoring and evaluation tools.  

The Social Work System Lead (TCM) for will serve as the primary lead for social work aspects of transitional care, playing a critical role in enhancing the effectiveness and coordination of social work interventions for patients receiving TCM services. The Social Work Lead will be a key part of the TCM System Implementation Team, collaborating with hospital-based transitional care social work leads, TCM program directors, and facility leadership, to support implementation of the TCM program, including through the development policies, workflows, operational guidance, tools and training. Working closely with both internal and external partners, including city agencies, community-based organizations and social service providers, the Social Work Lead will develop the strategy and partnerships needed for frontline teams to deliver consistent and effective whole-person transitional care, focusing on the systemwide infrastructure and support to address complex transitional social work need


The responsibilities of the SW Lead will include but are not limited to:  

* Develop and implement standardized enterprise-wise policies, workflows, operational guidance, and standards for social work interventions within the TCM program, ensuring alignment with organizational goals, best practices and regulatory requirements.
* Develop and implement standardized enterprise-wise policies, workflows, operational guidance, and standards for social work and behavioral health interventions within the TCM program, ensuring alignment with organizational goals, best practices and regulatory requirements.
* Collaborate with the Training Director to design and deliver comprehensive training programs for TCM staff and interdisciplinary teams, focusing on assessing and addressing complex social determinants of health, enhancing patient engagement, and supporting effective care transitions
* Work collaboratively with other Central Office stakeholders (e.g. Office of Population Health, Ambulatory Care, Office of Behavioral Health) to align with other care management programs and social work interventions, developing linkages between programs, and shared training and workflows where appropriate
* Foster strong collaboration and integration among different disciplines across the system, including Transitional Care Coordinators, Accountable Care Managers, Social Workers and medical providers
* Collaborate with the Epic team to optimize the Compass Rose TCM build to better address social needs, identifying opportunities and tools to improve workflows, documentation and performance management.
* Co-lead regular office hours for frontline staff to participate, provide feedback and be able to address social work-related barriers to effective transitional care
* Collaborate with the Program Director to hold quarterly meetings with each site leadership to assess gaps in training program, assess fidelity to the TCM, gain feedback, and summarize data on program implementation and impact
* Regularly visit with all system acute care hospitals to identify and support the needs of facility, TCM leadership and their staff.
* Utilize data analytics to monitor key performance indicators to assess the impact of social work interventions on patient outcomes and resource utilization, providing regular reports and recommendations for leadership to demonstrate program impact and identify areas for enhancement.
* Lead quality improvement initiatives to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of social work interventions within TCM, utilizing data-driven insights to continuously improve patient outcomes and program efficiency
* Participating in ongoing education, specialized training and research to learn and maintain skills needed for transitional care management.
* Perform other duties as assigned.
