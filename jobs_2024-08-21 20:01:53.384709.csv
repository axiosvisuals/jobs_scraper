Our clients are pretty high-profile – such as Tourism Nova Scotia, the United States Tour Operators Association, Perillo Tours, and the iconic Woodstock Inn & Resort in Vermont – so the work we do is both challenging and satisfying. Visit redpointmarketingpr.com for a full client list and deeper look into who we are.

Some helpful facts about our current situation:

* Our HQ is in NYC, but the whole staff works remotely, with occasional meetups.
* For this particular position, we’re looking for someone who lives in (or within commuting distance) to NYC.
* As your experience level and responsibilities increase, traveling to visit clients and go to conferences will become a periodic part of your job. You should be prepared to travel and love it as much as we do.
* A COVID vaccine is required. Though we’re not in the office, many of the destinations and other clients we serve require vaccinations for entry. It’s important that all our staff can participate fully in the work and travel our clients require.
* Though we’re all working remotely, we’re still all working closely together as a team. Expect to have lots of video meetings with Redpointers throughout the day. If you have a pet or a child, chances are we’ll see them often. We’re cool with that and we hope you are too.

**About You**

You have 1-2 years of hands-on PR experience, preferably working at an agency on multiple client programs.

Ideally, you have experience working with clients in the travel and hospitality industries. That’s not required but it’s definitely a plus.

At this point in your career, you have started to develop relationships with a network of journalists and influencers who know your name and pay attention to your pitches.

It would help tremendously if you already use Muck Rack or Cision.

You understand the general flow of PR account work and can handle a variety of basic PR tasks independently.

You understand the basics of crafting a story pitch.

**Your Role at Redpoint**

While you’re still learning many new aspects of PR, you’re not a square-one newbie. You’re writing solid first round drafts of press releases and pitches, engaging in some media interaction, and executing a sizeable amount of “low risk” pitching. You should also be helping the team by contributing new ideas and opportunities to your client work. Once you get settled into your role here and get familiar with your clients, your senior team members should feel comfortable with you working independently on many of your day-to-day tasks.

**Major Activities – Some Highlights of the Job**

* Help maintain productive and positive client relationships.
* Help research and develop story ideas for clients.
* Draft pitches and press releases where appropriate.
* Distribute pitches and press releases where appropriate and manage follow up.
* Engage independently in client, journalist, and influencer dialogue.
* Research and discover new media/journalist opportunities for your clients.
* Participate in client meetings and conference calls.
* Help your client teams with reporting and administration needs as appropriate.
* Help plan press visits, influencer visits, consumer events, trade events, conferences and more.

**Redpoint Benefits**

* Total Compensation Program that includes opportunities for bonuses and commission.
* 401k matching program.
* Comprehensive medical insurance – two plan options with Empire Blue Cross & Blue Shield (we pay most of the premium, you kick in a small stipend depending on which plan you choose).
* Employer paid life insurance.
* Employer paid short-term disability insurance.
* Employer paid long-term disability insurance.
* Employee Assistance Program, which provides services for counseling, legal/financial assistance, care giving assistance, employee discounts and more.
* Annual Wellness Stipend, which can be used for anything from dental bills and yoga classes to financial counseling, purchasing fitness equipment, pet insurance and much more.
* Generous PTO program, which includes a boat load of paid holidays (including Summer Fridays and office closure with full pay the week between Christmas and New Years Day) and a mandatory Rejuvenation Leave every five years of your tenure, which is four consecutive weeks off – fully paid – on top of your regular PTO.
* Growth & Development Program, which shepherds you through a variety of different learning experiences annually. This program includes a series of tailored Professional Development Retreats, a Relationship Building Program, and an annual personalized training budget to support classes, conference attendance and other learning opportunities relevant to your career development.
* Annual Career Development Assessment (CDA) program to help guide your goals and growth.
* Comprehensive New Child Caregiver Leave.
* Redpoint Social Occasions – hosted virtual outings (and sometimes in-person meetups!) arranged exclusively for Redpoint…from music concerts and safaris to influencer meet-and-greets, culinary tastings, and more.
* Travel perks! We’re fortunate to receive friends & family discounts in many travel destinations. So, besides traveling to lots of new places for work, the vacation opportunities can be pretty sweet too.

**How to Apply**

Yes, we know that cover letters are considered a drag these days, but we’re big fans of them. We are, after all, in the communications business and a letter helps us get to know you and how you approach persuasive writing. So, please send your resume and a letter telling us why you’d be a good fit for this job, based on everything you’ve read in this job posting. They can be emailed to hr@redpointmarketingpr.com. We’re willing to teach you the tools you need for the job, but if you have experience/expertise with Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, Powerpoint), Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Canva, any Adobe tools, Cision, Muck Rack, and/or any social media channels, definitely call that out in your application!

The Bareburger Mission is our North Star: our guiding light. That which helps guide us in a direction towards being extraordinary. In 2009 we had a very simple vision: let’s create the tastiest burger using local, organic, all natural & sustainable ingredients whenever possible. With that in mind, we opened a small restaurant in our hometown of Queens, NYC. We made a promise to offer our guests quality service that made them feel at home. Years later, we’re honored to serve clean food to our communities around the globe.  

Our greatest strength has always been creating a menu with choices that feel good for everyone. Thank you to all the partners, farmers, producers and distributors that we proudly call friends & family. We source mindfully, with our farmers, our environment and our guests in mind at all times. We will always look to the future of food and plant-based proteins which are undoubtedly at the forefront of sustainability. Our menu has plenty of plant-based options and is more delicious than ever. What we eat is who we are, and at Bareburger, we celebrate everyone.

**Achievement Unlocked** is a small, special education school in downtown Brooklyn. Our students are in 2nd-8th grade, have average to high IQs, and struggle with explaining what they need to succeed. Many of our students are on the Autism Spectrum and have varying degrees of academic potential.

We need special people like you to work as a part of our team. We want support staff to be hard-working people who enjoy being with children who have quirky personalities. Our students often have not done well in schools before coming to AU and typically like video games, chess, coding, and role-playing games. If you have experience with children like this, you may be perfect for our school.

You will be working with students to engage them in academics, help them focus, strengthen their planning ability, and practice social skills. You will also work closely with the teachers and our related service providers. We believe that all children can learn if given the proper individual support socially, emotionally, and academically. We are not a 1:1 program, but at AU there is almost a 1:1 student adult ratio. Our education programs are individualized to cater to every student at their precise level of need, providing the support necessary for their growth. A typical day in the life of a support person is detailed further below.

AU team members are:

* Experienced with the community we serve
* Passionate and rigorous about engaging in any content areas
* Dedicated to regularly assessing students and using the results to inform instruction
* Able to empower adolescents to find their voice and take charge of their learning
* Collaborative with colleagues, students, and families
* Innovative self-starters who contribute to the good of a diverse c community
* Committed to coaching adolescents in interpersonal skills and making good choices
* Reflective and open-minded

**Details of a typical day in the life of an AU support staff**

Arrive at school. Review the day's lesson plans and discuss planned accommodations and contingencies for students with the lead teacher(s). Set up for data collection. Get the classroom ready for the day's activities.

Assist students with arrival procedures as they arrive. Help students overcome school refusal and enter the school when necessary. Help unpack, store lunch, check homework. Support your lead teacher in morning activities, and help preview students about the day's events.

Assist with instruction during academic periods. Support the lead teacher, work with a small group, and/or take a student 1:1 for extra support. Reinforce students who are displaying adaptive behavior, prompt students who are not. Scaffold both learning and behavior. Help students to manage crises, take breaks, and access accommodations. Take data. Challenge students to do better.

After your lunch, go to recess with the kids. Help them learn how to play with one another appropriately, and learn from their mistakes. Teach them the games they missed out on learning because they were never included.

After recess, assist someone for the afternoon in teaching a non-academic subject, with the goal of building long-term life skills while having fun at the same time. Or, lead an enrichment class yourself and teach a small group about a skill that you yourself are proficient in.

At the end of the school day, check-in with students about their day. Find out what they learned and will take it home with them. Make sure they get safely back to their parents. Communicate important information about their days.

Once students have departed, debrief with your classroom team. Discuss what worked and did not work. Make plans for tomorrow. Write or assist your lead teacher with various reports where necessary. Reset the classroom for the next day. Check, give feedback on, or file away student work, and attend various weekly meetings or case conferences. Collaborate with all team members to find best practice solutions. Provide feedback on interventions in progress. Report on concerns for self, team, and/or individual students, engage in reflective practices.

Salary is dependent upon experience and education.

Please include a cover letter. Thank you.

*THE CITY AND COMMUNITY OF NEWARK*

*The City of Newark consists of five wards, more than 25 dynamic neighborhoods, a thriving downtown, and world-class arts, entertainment and recreational amenities.

*Newark is also the nexus of the state’s rail, highway and freight networks, making it central to the region’s economy. It is in the center of the nation’s Northeast Corridor, accounting for one-fifth of the country’s GDP, and the historic Penn Station offers frequent connections to New York City and other major cities via New Jersey Transit (NJT), Amtrak, and the PATH train, as well as the city’s two light rail lines. Within the city, NJT carries 165,000 daily riders on 38 bus lines serving destinations across Northern New Jersey via vibrant commercial corridors and a network of major federal and state highways connecting the region. Newark Liberty International Airports employs 24,000 people, moves over 46 million passengers and is one of the nation’s largest air-freight hubs.

Founded in 2002, we are a boutique PR & marketing agency that serves clients in the travel, tourism, and hospitality industries. Our culture is pretty relaxed, but still professional. When it comes to the team, we place emphasis on learning, empathy, support, kindness, and growth through risk-taking. That emphasis is probably why our staff turnover is so low…people enjoy working together here and they appreciate being treated like individual humans with different needs and growth patterns. Our clients are pretty high-profile – such as Tourism Nova Scotia, the United States Tour Operators Association, Perillo Tours, and the iconic Woodstock Inn & Resort in Vermont – so the work we do is both challenging and satisfying. Visit redpointmarketingpr.com for a full client list and deeper look into who we are.

Some helpful facts about our current situation:

· Our HQ is in NYC, but the whole staff works remotely, with occasional meetups.

· For this particular position, we’re looking for someone who lives in (or within commuting distance) to NYC.

· As your experience level and responsibilities increase, traveling to visit clients and go to conferences will become a periodic part of your job. You should be prepared to travel and love it as much as we do.

· A COVID vaccine is required. Though we’re not in the office, many of the destinations and other clients we serve require vaccinations for entry. It’s important that all our staff can participate fully in the work and travel our clients require.

· Though we’re all working remotely, we’re still all working closely together as a team. Expect to have lots of video meetings with Redpointers throughout the day. If you have a pet or a child, chances are we’ll see them often. We’re cool with that and we hope you are too.

**Your Role at Redpoint**

An account assistant on the PR team is an entry level position here at Redpoint. Maybe you’ve had some PR/marketing internship experience in the past, but we don’t expect you to come in having had ANY experience or knowing a ton about PR. In addition to being the support backbone of your PR client teams, your biggest responsibility is to learn. Be a sponge. Soak up information about everything we do by enthusiastically trying anything you’re asked to tackle, asking a ton of questions, and observing everything that goes on at Redpoint. Though this is a junior position, it doesn’t make your role – or your position within our company – any less important. Not only are your client responsibilities vital to the success of their programs, but also, you’re expected to be an engaged participant in Redpoint’s culture and company activities…from staff meetings to company projects and everything in between. You’ll get to know and work closely with everyone at Redpoint, including the two owners.

Please note: our entry level job salary is $45,000 plus all the benefits listed below. If you have a year of related, full-time PR work experience (post college), you may be a notch above entry level... in which case we may consider you for a slightly higher salary and title.

**Major Activities – Highlights of the Job**

* Assist your client teams with daily program activities, including press release/pitch distribution, press visit planning, photo library management, special events, and more.
* Participate in client meetings and help move the agenda forward.
* Tons of research on tons of subjects relevant to client needs.
* Monitor Google Alerts and other media tracking tools for each of your clients daily and handle each piece of news according to each client’s needs.
* Monitor each of your clients’ social media and online review channels daily and share noteworthy comments, questions, or issues with your teams.
* Assist your client teams with all client reporting.
* Respond to journalist and client requests as appropriate.
* Develop understanding of how client programs are created and each element is implemented.
* Perform independent special projects for clients as directed by supervisors. FYI, these are rarely boring because our clients do cool things! You could be buying group theater tickets, sourcing an obscure recipe, locating a dog that can skateboard, or plotting out a multi-province travel itinerary in Canada. It’s rarely the same thing twice.
* Learn all aspects of the various media (consumer, trade, print, broadcast, online, podcast, etc.) and develop an understanding of how each is relevant to our clients, and why.
* Provide creative input on marketing and PR ideas for all company clients.
* Participate proactively and thoughtfully in Redpoint staff meetings and company projects.

**Redpoint Benefits**

· Total Compensation Program that includes opportunities for bonuses and commission.

· 401k matching program.

· Comprehensive medical insurance – three plan options with Empire Blue Cross & Blue Shield (we pay most of the premium, you kick in a small stipend depending on which plan you choose).

· Employer paid life insurance.

· Employer paid short-term disability insurance.

· Employer paid long-term disability insurance.

· Employee Assistance Program, which provides services for counseling, legal/financial assistance, care giving assistance, employee discounts and more.

· Generous PTO program, which includes a boat load of paid holidays (including Summer Fridays and office closure with full pay the week between Christmas and New Years Day) and a mandatory Rejuvenation Leave every five years of your tenure, which is four consecutive weeks off – fully paid – on top of your regular PTO.

· Growth & Development Program, which shepherds you through a variety of different learning experiences annually. This program includes a series of tailored Professional Development Retreats, a Relationship Building Program, and an annual personalized training budget to support classes, conference attendance and other learning opportunities relevant to your career development.

· Annual Career Development Assessment (CDA) program to help guide your goals and growth.

· Comprehensive New Child Caregiver Leave.

· Monthly Redpoint Social Occasions – hosted virtual outings arranged exclusively for Redpoint…from music concerts and safaris to influencer meet-and-greets, culinary tastings, and more.

· Travel perks! We’re fortunate to receive friends & family discounts in many travel destinations. So, besides traveling to lots of new places for work, the vacation opportunities can be pretty sweet too.

**2025-2026 Human Rights Accountability Legal Fellowship**
Human Rights First (HRF) is excited to announce the availability of a postgraduate legal fellowship with HRF’s Accountability team. HRF is accepting applications from third-year law students and recent graduates who have secured outside funding and are seeking a host for a one-year postgraduate public interest fellowship. HRF is willing to work with qualifying candidates to secure funding where necessary.
Among other opportunities, the Human Rights Accountability Legal Fellow will assist HRF’s Accountability team in its work to promote human rights and the rule of law through the imposition of targeted sanctions against the world’s worst human rights abusers and perpetrators of corruption – one of the most cutting-edge programs in contemporary human rights.
Human Rights First leads a coalition of more than 330 NGOs from 50-plus countries that use targeted sanctions, like the Global Magnitsky sanctions program, to push the U.S. government to sanction human rights abusers and corrupt foreign actors. Working with a diverse array of partners, HRF provides the U.S. government with well-researched and documented recommendations that identify significant human rights abuses and crimes of corruption and those responsible who may be eligible for targeted sanctions and/or visa restrictions. Over the past seven years, approximately one-third of the U.S. government sanctions designations under the Global Magnitsky sanctions program have had a basis in our coalition’s recommendations.
The recipient of this fellowship will have an opportunity to participate in an accountability effort that consistently and concretely impacts human rights outcomes and challenges impunity. The Human Rights Accountability Legal Fellow will be directly involved in the operation and support of HRF’s large coalition of NGOs, and will be responsible for researching, drafting, and editing recommendation files that identify persons who have committed serious human rights abuses and acts of corruption.
The recipient of the fellowship will be actively involved in helping formulate HRF’s strategy to continue growing our work as we build relationships with civil society partners as well as officials from the U.S. and foreign governments with similar laws. As such, the fellow will have a meaningful opportunity to grapple with domestic and international legal and policy issues, and will contribute to an area of human rights and anti-corruption advocacy that is expanding rapidly in exciting, challenging, and impactful ways.
**Job Responsibilities*** Assist in Human Rights First’s efforts to promote and facilitate the use of targeted human rights and anti-corruption sanctions under the Global Magnitsky sanctions program and other similar authorities, including working with other civil society groups, the Department of State, and the Department of the Treasury to expand and increase the effectiveness of the administration’s use of its targeted sanctions and visa restrictions programs.
* In coordination with the Accountability team and other NGOs, help review and prepare recommendations identifying Global Magnitsky sanctions targets to the United States government to quickly respond to emerging human rights crises and identify advocacy opportunities to support the issuance of sanctions.
* Work with the Accountability team to address time-sensitive issues related to emerging U.S. foreign policy and human rights issues, and conduct fact-finding and research on human rights and rule of law trends in the United States and relevant regions, as assigned.
* Participate in meetings and other advocacy with executive branch officials and members of Congress and their staff on Capitol Hill.
* Research and draft reports, blogs, op-eds, and other materials relating to the use of U.S. and other government sanctions tools and other accountability mechanisms, and the human rights implications of U.S. foreign policy and democratic backsliding.
* Assist in organizing public events related to the use and adoption of targeted human rights and anti-corruption sanctions.
* Update and develop resources related to targeted human rights and anti-corruption sanctions, such as recommendation templates, sanctions explainers, spreadsheets tracking sanctions designations, frequently asked questions, etc.
* Assist in advising other governments or legislatures (e.g., in the European Union, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, etc.) on how to design and implement legislation to establish global human rights and anti-corruption targeted sanctions programs.
* Other duties as requested based on department and/or organizational need.

**Qualifications*** Secured funding from an outside organization (law school, law firm, foundation, etc.).
* A Juris Doctorate (J.D.), J.D. equivalent, or Master of Laws (L.L.M.) degree in a relevant field from an accredited U.S. law school, or enrollment in a program working toward completion of one of these degrees by August 2024
* Authorization to work in the United States
* Strong legal and policy research and writing skills, including the ability to monitor and analyze relevant national and international policy and legal developments.
* Demonstrated ability to translate highly technical material for a variety of audiences, ranging from government investigators to congressional staff to readers of mainstream newspapers and specialized blogs
* Prior experience in human rights or anti-corruption-related law and/or advocacy, with a preferred focus on international human rights law, domestic human rights legislation, and policy
* Project management experience, strong organizational and interpersonal skills, and an ability to coordinate efforts internally with colleagues and with outside partners
* A strong work ethic, demonstrated capacity to take initiative, and time management skills to handle multiple tasks and projects
* A sense of humor and ability to work collegially with other staff members
* Ability to communicate patiently, respectfully, and empathetically with individuals from a variety of backgrounds, including survivors of trauma or family members of political prisoners
* High level of integrity and discretion in handling sensitive information
* Ability to build and maintain relationships with civil society, government agencies, Congressional offices, etc.

The world of work is changing…short commutes, flexibility, and convenience are the minimum standards employees want when it comes to how they want to work!



At IWG, we are leading the way. We’ve built the world’s largest workspace network so that our customers can work from wherever, and however, they want… in over 120 countries across the globe!



Join us and help us bring more freedom to people and businesses, while expanding our network. You’ll be able to enjoy a great work life balance and competitive benefits, while growing your career path along the way.

  


**The opportunity**



As a Community Manager, you’ll be responsible for the smooth running of your center. You’ll motivate your team to create a great working environment to ensure customer satisfaction and retention.

  


**A typical day at IWG**



You start the day with a quick review of the daily report, to plan the day and make sure everyone’s prepared.



With one eye always on reception, you see members turning up and the first meeting rooms guests arriving. You welcome them and take them to their meeting room, show them the facilities and help them set up their Wi-Fi connections and screen sharing app for their presentation.



Later you have a meeting to learn more about a new member and get to understand his business needs. You think about the other businesses in the center and how you might be able to introduce him to a couple that may be of interest at the networking event later in the week.



It’s time for a quick coffee break, relax and enjoy a few minutes to yourself.



A large company is taking a whole floor of the center and is moving in next week. You run through the move in detail with your Community Associate, ensuring the welcome kit is prepared, and all badges and keys are ready for handing over.



Shortly before your lunch break, a couple walk in enquiring about coworking membership. Your colleague from sales is on their lunch break so you offer them a coffee and give them a tour of the center, explaining all the benefits of IWG membership. You are then off to lunch.



Later in the afternoon you review billing to ensure all customers are current and walk the space to ensure everything is show ready for a tour in the morning. You notice a few light bulbs out in the café and put a ticket in the service portal for replacement. You take a few pictures of your show offices and post sales ads for your vacant office.



You’ve earned yourself another quick coffee break, relax and enjoy a few minutes to yourself.



Before heading out you review paid time off requests for next month to ensure you have appropriate coverage and prepare for a 1:1 coaching conversation with one of your team members the next day. You do a final walk around the building, speaking with members, asking how their day went as they start to wind down and head for home.

  



**About you**



We’re looking for someone who has the experience and aptitude to manage a smooth-running operation. You’ll need to be an accomplished multitasker, able to pre-empt issues before they become problems, and keep a team motivated and focused on service excellence. You also need to be:


* A good communicator, used to dealing with customers – ideally in the hospitality or events industry with 3+ years of strong customer service & escalation handling experience

* Positive, enthusiastic, and able to adapt to fast-changing situations
* Experience and confidence using MS Office and other basic IT equipment
* Legally eligible to work in the Country you are applying within and at least 18 years old

An anti-establishment establishment.  

Founded in 2012 in Washington, D.C.’s historic H Street NE corridor, &pizza set out to create a different kind of pizza shop - one where experience is the focal point, and every shop reflects the culture and people of its neighborhood.  

&pizza strives to become more than a pizza shop. Emphasizing the connectivity, inclusivity, and unity inherent in the ampersand that defines the brand, &pizza ultimately represents a movement. Through dynamic flavor combinations, an unorthodox approach to apparel and partnerships, and a dedicated approach to providing every guest with a completely individualized experience, &pizza seeks to define trends, not follow them.
