The Law Department is accepting applications for the position of Deputy Chief of the Special Federal Litigation Division. The Special Federal Litigation Division defends the City and its officials in civil rights cases brought in federal court in which police, district attorney or correction officer misconduct is alleged. The Deputy Chief assists the Chief in the management, administration, and oversight of the work of the Division. In addition, the Deputy Chief litigates complex high-profile cases, which includes supervision of litigation team(s) on Monell claims, particularly in e-discovery and witness depositions as well as advises client agencies on an array of issues.  

  

The deadline to apply is October 4, 2024.  

  

After the completion of orientation, attorneys hired by the Law Department will have the opportunity to elect to work from home under one of the following two programs. The first option allows attorneys to work remotely on a limited and irregular basis. The second option is a Citywide pilot program, which allows participants to select two set days to work from home each week. The two days will need to be approved by the attorney’s division and take into consideration the needs of the division, as the pilot program requires more than 50% staff coverage each day. In addition, if an attorney needs to appear in court, a client meeting or other in-person work related event on a set work from home day, they will need to attend to those in-person responsibilities and will not be able to work from home that day. Participants in the pilot program must set one work from home location where they will work remotely. This pilot program is currently being tested Citywide to determine its efficacy for City agencies and is not yet a permanent program.  

  

To apply, please upload your cover letter, resume, writing sample, and a list of three references with contact information as one document under “resume.”

This covers the design of algorithms that leverage advanced machine learning techniques to improve robustness and sample efficiency, the building of datasets or simulators of ecological data, and benchmarks to compare how fast children and machines learn given similar input. The focus is on grounded language and communication. We publish groundbreaking papers and release frameworks/libraries that are widely used in the open-source community fostering the advancement of AI at its intersection with the study of natural intelligence. We seek researchers with a mixed expertise in machine learning (speech, language, core ML) and cognitive science (developmental or language science) to join our research team to foster cutting-edge research in Developmental AI.
