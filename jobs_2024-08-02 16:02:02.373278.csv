Since its inception over 30 years ago, HomeFront has worked to break the cycle of poverty and end homelessness in Central New Jersey, serving tens of thousands of Mercer County, New Jersey families. In the past year alone, families came to us over 50,000 times for shelter, food and life-changing assistance. Started by volunteers providing meals for families living in welfare motels in and around Trenton, HomeFront has since developed a holistic array of services for clients who are experiencing homeless, facing complex barriers to economic opportunity, or working hard to make ends meet. Our work is best captured by our mission statement: HomeFront’s mission is to end homelessness in Central New Jersey by harnessing the caring, resources and expertise of the community. We lessen the immediate pain of homelessness and help families become self-sufficient.

We work to give our clients the skills and opportunities to ensure adequate incomes, and we work to increase the availability of adequate, affordable housing. We help homeless families advocate for themselves individually and collectively.

**Job Summary/Objective** 

HomeFront is seeking a strong leader with passion, dedication, and a deep desire to help families break the cycle of poverty to lead our our effort to assess the needs of new and existing clients, make accurate and timely referrals, gather required paperwork, collaborate with internal and external partners, manage family needs and diaper program operations, and ensure high quality, trauma-informed service for every family seeking our assistance. One of HomeFront’s core beliefs is that families need basic necessities to live lives with dignity. Picture a family in real home. In that vision, you’ll see parents and kids sitting around a table sharing a nourishing meal or a young student seated at a desk doing homework. Parents and kids are sleeping in beds with clean sheets and their clothing is stowed away in dressers – not in garbage bags. That’s our vision, too, and HomeFront’s Resource Network – combined with our donors’ kindness – make it a reality for homeless and very low-income families. HomeFront was founded on the idea that our community bears a responsibility to meet the basic human needs of our neighbors. Helping families secure safe and secure housing is critical but housing isn’t a home. Families also need food, clothing, pots and pans, linens, and furniture to live lives with dignity. These are things that most of us take for granted, but for our area’s poorest families, these necessities can be difficult, if not impossible, to acquire.

The HomeFront Client Services Manager scope includes:

* Direct supervision of up to 3-4 Resource Network staff and oversight of volunteers working in the Choice Food Pantry.
* The HomeFront Front Desk - the first point of entry for thousands of families a year that are seeking the wide range of support services that HomeFront offers.

The Choice Pantry also provides diapers, hygiene items, and produce, and it supports the grocery bags provided across the agency, including the FreeStore
* Annual Drives – Thousands of families a year receive support through our Diaper Challenge, Back to School, Thanksgiving, and Holiday Wishes Drives.

**Work Schedule:** 

Monday 9am-5pm, Tuesday 9am-6pm, Wednesday-Friday 9am-5pm

We recognize the impact the fashion industry has on the world, and we're dedicated to learning how to be better stewards of the planet. We believe the power of conversation and connection can make real change, and we're committed to supporting people and organizations doing work that we believe in.

We welcome everyone — and we mean everyone. We believe a diversity of viewpoints, experiences, and backgrounds only serve to make our team stronger, which is why we strongly encourage those from historically and systemically marginalized communities to apply: BIPOC, women, and people in the LGBTQIA+ community, to name a few. We strive to lead consciously, bravely, and inclusively — and to reflect those values in our work. We live by six key pillars:
