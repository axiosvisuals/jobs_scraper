Are you passionate, driven, and looking for an intellectually charged environment where you can make an impact? As a science teacher in New York City’s top-performing network of K-12 charter schools, you will join a team of professionals committed to teaching and preparing children from low-income neighborhoods to be self-assured thinkers and leaders, capable of exploring and debating sophisticated ideas, and ready for college and whatever they set their sights on.


At Success Academy, our Science program ignites a passion in scholars for scientific thinking and curiosity. We develop our scholars as citizens of science, empowering them to engage creatively, critically, and meaningfully with the world around them in ways that are endlessly fascinating, complex, and philosophical.


Scholars engage flexibly with different scientific disciplines, compelling them to see engineering, physics, mathematics, chemistry, and biology as all interdependent. We also place a strong emphasis on scientific literacy, with special attention to reading, writing, and data literacy.


A background in education is not required. At Success Academy, we provide you with extensive training and a proven curriculum so you can focus on working with your students instead of building lesson plans.


As we move rapidly toward our most ambitious years yet, we are looking for great minds with the drive to develop exceptional leadership skills, the collaborative spirit to elevate our learning community, and the passion to put their knowledge to work for profound social impact on behalf of children.

* Have the opportunity to grow as a leader and ultimately a leader of the entire grade team. There are also opportunities to enter our school leadership track as an assistant principal as well as to transition to our network office.

**About Us:**



Competitive triathletes and passionate bakers, Pam Weekes and Connie McDonald left their careers to open a small bread shop in New York City in 1995 — Levain Bakery.  

One day, they baked a BIG chocolate chip walnut cookie as energy for triathlon training. At Levain, a batch of these 6-ounce cookies flew off the shelves, and an icon was born. The cozy shop on West 74th Street became a neighborhood favorite and a destination for epicurious visitors from around the world, hungry for “the cookie.”  


From the start, Pam, Connie and team baked everything fresh on-site each day, donating the day’s leftovers to charity — and we still do, nearly 30 years later. Today, Levain has bakeries across the country (with more to come!), plus ecommerce gift boxes to treat cookie lovers in every state.  


Every day, we strive to embody our company’s five core values:
* Welcome All- *we are all in it together*
* Work Hard and Be Nice- *we go above and beyond*
* Lead with Heart- *we do the right thing*
* Rise Up- *we are proactive*
