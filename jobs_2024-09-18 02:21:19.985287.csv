A well-established national financial services company, valued at $8.2 billion and in business for 12 years, is looking for agents to refer new customers. We offer large referral bonuses paid weekly for your efforts.

All you have to do is send people a simple video and a link. The program has been running for 12 years, and once your referrals see it, they’ll want to join. By referring just 2 to 5 people a week, you can earn significant weekly bonuses. Every time your referrals open an account with this trusted financial institution, you receive a referral bonus. You can even refer more people and make up to $3,000 per month while working just 4-5 hours a week. If you’re married or have a partner, you can double your earnings each month.

This is not networking, direct marketing, or cold calling. It’s an excellent way to supplement your income. I will guide you through the entire process so you can start earning money quickly and easily. If you’re computer literate and have 4-5 hours a week to dedicate to this, you can realistically make between $2,800 and $3,200 per month.

To qualify, you must have a strong desire to help others, which will result in great supplemental income. We’re looking for self-starters, highly motivated individuals who are eager to succeed. You should have a primary source of income and be interested in supplementing it with large weekly referral bonuses.

About the Brearley School
  
Founded in 1884, Brearley's mission has long combined outstanding academics with an insistence on a larger purpose: A passionate exchange of ideas within the School's walls that would prepare girls of adventurous intellect and diverse backgrounds to put their knowledge and habits of mind and character to meaningful use in the wider world.
  
  

A center of intellectual exuberance, the School offers an extraordinary program to girls from across and beyond New York City, attracting and developing a dynamic and committed faculty, who, along with a talented staff, instill in Brearley students a love of learning, an ability to think critically and creatively, a deep curiosity about the world and a pioneering spirit. (View the Brearley School Mission Statement.)
  
  

**Stepping Through the Open Door:** An Updated Strategic Vision, the guide for our institution’s future, doesn’t just focus on the end result or the “what,” but asks “how” and “why” we move forward through a series of questions. Our Socratic approach is more dynamic and allows us to interrogate more deeply the four cornerstones of our plan, namely people, program, sustainability and communications. These questions are grounded in and inspired by our six core institutional values of purpose, integrity, excellence, courage, empathy and inclusion. This level of inquiry is what we deem essential to offer a world-class education.
  
  

**We ask ourselves:**  

* How do the people at Brearley nurture a sense of friendship, integrity and purpose?
* How does the program cultivate excellence through hard work, inclusion and the pursuit of truth?
* How do we communicate with courage and empathy to build a culture of belonging and a community free of bias and prejudice?
* How can we allocate our resources to sustain our environment and our school for future generations?


We believe that a Brearley education is not for oneself alone. Every member of our community plays a vital role in shaping the School today and for the future, cultivating the joy of lifelong learning and lasting friendships, the confidence to pursue one’s ambitions and a commitment to the greater good.
  
  

Among the hallmarks of Brearley is the belief that our students are best served by faculty who
  
teach in more than one division. We believe that in this way, teachers best come to know students as unique individuals over time and have the keenest appreciation for the scope, sequence and coherence of the curriculum. Our faculty finds an ever-renewing source of inspiration in the liberal arts, always with an eye to encouraging their students to go beyond the familiar and to find a sense of joy and balance in pursuits from the intellectual to the artistic, from athletics to leadership. The recent creation of a campus on East End Avenue with a second academic building and a new Middle and Upper School library offers students, faculty and staff the opportunity to live the Brearley experience in an even more thoughtful and balanced manner. The new Visual Arts Center opening in September of 2025 is the next transformational project in Brearley’s heritage building.
  
  

Brearley recently announced a “Free Tuition” program for families with incomes of $100,000 or less and without significant assets. This program was approved by the Board of Trustees after a year of study by its Composition of the Student Body Task Force.
  
  

Brearley's Upper School, with 255 students, aims to help each girl develop a sense of self as she masters new academic, social, emotional and physical skills. The School's Counseling and Wellness Department and the Equity and Community Engagement Office support this important work. In addition, the program asks students to take on responsibility for themselves that is appropriately and progressively greater each year. Upper School students, with the support of advisors, lead a robust extracurricular program—including 32 clubs and associations and 12 affinity groups—in addition to athletic teams and arts groups. They also lead the day-long Belonging at Brearley program, in partnership with the Equity and Community Engagement Office, with the goal of enhancing our community culture so that all students and families feel a sense of belonging.

Reporter, Financial Regulation, New York


The Wall Street Journal is looking for an enterprising and well-sourced reporter to cover financial regulation and how it protects - or fails to protect - consumers.


The U.S. financial system is a sprawling network of banks, exchanges, asset managers and payment networks. It is governed by a mishmash of federal, state and local regulators. The importance of that matrix was on display in 2023 when three U.S. banks failed in rapid succession, catching their regulators off guard and sparking fears of a 2008-style meltdown.


We’re looking for a reporter who can help our readers understand the complicated interplay between regulator and regulated, and how their actions affect consumers. We need someone who can break news about proposals regulators are considering and how financial institutions are responding to them.


The person should also be a watchdog for consumers, breaking news on novel financial products, highlighting fees and risks and helping set the conversation about where regulation is working and failing.


There’s much ground to cover, and the stakes are high. Last year’s turmoil exposed cracks in the banking business model, especially among the thousands of community banks Americans rely on.


The ideal candidate is deeply familiar with the inner workings of financial markets and the political dynamics that influence the regulatory environment. We also need a sharp writer skilled at finding creative ways to bring complex concepts alive through colorful and deeply reported stories. A desire to collaborate with colleagues in different coverage areas is a must.


You will:


* Break news on the regulatory actions of the biggest financial firms
* Distill complex financial concepts into language that’s easy to grasp for everyday consumers
* Source across the regulatory landscape, consumer groups and lenders
* Find the darker corners and hidden maneuvers of financial firms, big and small

You have:


* Willingness and ability to study, understand and get excited about difficult topics in finance and regulation
* Sharp reporting instincts and strong writing skills
* A keen attention to detail and obsession with accuracy

The position is based in New York and reports to Wall Street Editors Cara Lombardo and David Benoit.


Reasonable accommodation: Dow Jones, Making Careers Newsworthy - We are an equal opportunity employer and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, pregnancy, age, national origin, disability status, genetic information, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law.EEO/AA/M/F/Disabled/Vets.

**Life at Abridge**
-------------------


At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.


Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

**Diversity & Inclusion**
-------------------------


Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

**Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud**
----------------------------------------------------------


We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process. Any emails from the Abridge recruiting team will come from an @abridge.com email address. You can learn more about how to protect yourself from these types of fraud by referring to this article. Please exercise caution and cease communications if something feels suspicious about your interactions.

StaffCo is a Professional Employer Organization, commonly referred to as a PEO, duly organized and registered under the New York Professional Employer Organization law. StaffCo and SUNY have entered into a professional employer agreement under which StaffCo is the employer of Stony Brook Clinical Practice Management Plan employees and responsible for all aspects of employment, including hirings, promotions, disciplines, terminations, the day-to-day direction and supervision of work, as well as labor relations and collective bargaining. StaffCo is fully responsible for providing all payroll and human resources services, including the payment of wages, collecting and reporting payroll taxes and maintaining any and all employee benefits. SUNY Stony Brook Hospital is responsible for the operation of the hospital and provision of health care and is the co-employer as is necessary to conduct its responsibilities and for related licensure, regulatory or statutory requirements and obligations.  

Given StaffCo’s employment responsibilities, it is deemed the “employer” for employment and labor law purposes. Thus, the employees are private sector employees of StaffCo, not public sector employees of SUNY. The private sector nature of the StaffCo employees has been approved by NYS Civil Service and upheld in a decision by the US National Labor Relations Board.
