Scotiabank’s strong U.S. presence provides our clients an important bridge to this key global market for trade and investment flows across the Americas and the world.

  

Global Banking and Markets provides a full range of investment banking, credit and risk management products and services relevant to the financing and strategic development needs of our clients. Our products include debt and equity financing, mergers & acquisitions, corporate banking, institutional equity sales, trading and research, fixed income products, derivatives, energy, foreign exchange, and precious & metals. We also cross-sell the full range of wholesale products and services offered by the Scotiabank Group.


Be part of an innovative, Global Capital Markets and Investment Banking business with a unique geographic footprint that puts capital to work for our clients across industries! We work together to drive ambition for every future!

 **Overview:**


The Infrastructure & Project Finance (“IPF”) team is part of Scotiabank Corporate and Investment (“CIB”) Division. IPF works closely with a wide range of industry coverage and product partners to originate, structure, and execute structured, acquisition, and project financings. IPF provides sector expertise, strategic advisory, and tailored financial solutions to our clients across developed and emerging markets. IPF’s primary focus is providing and arranging debt financing (e.g., greenfield and brownfield projects, corporate, acquisition) and debt advisory services for strategic owners and financial sponsors in the infrastructure space, including ports, airports, toll roads, public infrastructure, renewable energy, conventional power, transmission, digital infrastructure, and energy infrastructure across the Americas.

 **Position Highlights:**


Associates in Infrastructure & Project Finance enjoy a stimulating and challenging work environment in which they execute a broad range of transactions across various forms and sources of debt capital.

**About the Role**


We’re looking for driven, high-EQ Registered Dietitians licensed in any state to help us bring medical nutrition therapy (MNT) to the masses. This role is flexible and can fit around your existing work schedule.

**Who We Are**


At Berry Street, we live by 3 core beliefs:


1. Nutrition is the most controllable input to our overall health (and the most impactful!), but improving your nutrition is hard.


2. It’s easier to make sustainable changes + build a more positive relationship with food with an empathetic nutrition expert in your corner.


3. Registered dietitians are the most under-appreciated + under-utilized providers in healthcare — they’re the missing piece on folks’ care teams.


Berry Street connects patients with registered dietitians who take their insurance and specialize in their specific health needs. We’re on a mission to make seeing the RD more common in America than seeing the dentist.


For RDs, we help you get in-network with health plans fast so you can start adding insurance patients to your client book. Once you’re in-network, we handle all the tedious work — finding new patients, onboarding them, scheduling sessions, processing insurance claims — so you can spend 100% of your time working directly with patients.

**What You’ll Do:**

* Provide life-changing nutrition therapy via remote sessions to patients who fit your areas of specialty
* Collaborate with the product team to design a best-in-class nutrition program and contribute towards continuous improvement of the patient experience.
* Co-create the tools you’ve always wished you’ve had to improve your experience as an RD alongside our crack team of technologists.
* Work from anywhere in the U.S. and choose the hours that fit your schedule best. This is a 1099-Contractor position.

**What You** ***Won’t*** **Do:**

* Spend hours upon hours on confusing administrative work.
* Navigate the insurance credentialing mazes and battle payers for reimbursement.
* Stress about finding your own patients and handle their intake and scheduling.

**Requirements**

**You’ll be a good fit for Berry Street if…**

* You’re self-starter – you know how to take initiative and work independently and tirelessly for your clients and private practice
* You are tech savvy or an enthusiast – we have several platforms you will need to navigate and learn quickly
* You thrive in telehealth environment – most of your appointments will be in this format
* You have a growth mindset – you are open to feedback and excited to adapt your skills to retain your caseload

**What You’ll Need:**

* Active Registration by the Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR)
* Licensed in Nutrition/Dietetics in any state(s)
* Experience working with patients remotely via telehealth platforms like Zoom
* High EQ to build and maintain strong relationships with your patients
* Adaptability to quickly learn new methods and systems
* A minimum of 8 hours per week of ongoing availability
