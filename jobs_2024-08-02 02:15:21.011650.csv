**About Us:**



Competitive triathletes and passionate bakers, Pam Weekes and Connie McDonald left their careers to open a small bread shop in New York City in 1995 — Levain Bakery.  

One day, they baked a BIG chocolate chip walnut cookie as energy for triathlon training. At Levain, a batch of these 6-ounce cookies flew off the shelves, and an icon was born. The cozy shop on West 74th Street became a neighborhood favorite and a destination for epicurious visitors from around the world, hungry for “the cookie.”  


From the start, Pam, Connie and team baked everything fresh on-site each day, donating the day’s leftovers to charity — and we still do, nearly 30 years later. Today, Levain has bakeries across the country (with more to come!), plus ecommerce gift boxes to treat cookie lovers in every state.  


Every day, we strive to embody our company’s five core values:
* Welcome All- *we are all in it together*
* Work Hard and Be Nice- *we go above and beyond*
* Lead with Heart- *we do the right thing*
* Rise Up- *we are proactive*
* Savor It- *we are present and find the fun!*","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Levain-Bakery","http://www.levainbakery.com","New York","2 to 10","less than $1M (USD)","","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/1497c6aa21dc80b7a30bd7185f92e8ca","","",""

Danone is a purpose-driven organization. Our mission is to bring health through food to as many people as possible.


**Why do we exist?** The Mission and Sustainability (M&S) team develops and enables the implementation of all of Danone North America’s impact efforts. We connect several integrated impact efforts across our Danone Impact Journey (DIJ): Nature, Health, and Communities.



The M&S team provides strategic oversight, direction, and governance across these topics and ensures a deep collaboration with our Global Danone counterparts. We partner with multiple cross-functional internal stakeholders (e.g., procurement, sales, categories, research and innovation, etc.) and external stakeholders. Our key roles include: developing strategic plans and business cases on ROI/tradeoffs, developing roadmaps, tracking implementation, and providing advisory on best practices.


**What will you do?**



The Manager will own the project management of multiple initiatives that deliver on our team’s strategy. The Manager will also lead on the strategic direction (framing, problem solving, influence) of these initiatives, in close alignment with the Senior Director on the team and/or the Vice President’s consultation. The Manager will play an agile role across multiple topical and functional areas of expertise: Health and Communities within our DIJ; and Planning and Strategy writ large regarding our overall enterprise impact roadmap:


* Develop and own rigorous quantitative modeling and qualitative problem solving and insights to develop DNA’s Health and Communities strategies (levers, goals, KPIs) and implementation roadmaps (programs, roles/responsibilities, financials, measurement, etc.)


* Bring strategy to action through collaboration with multiple cross-functional senior stakeholders (e.g., Public Affairs, Scientific Affairs, Research and Innovation, Procurement, Category Planning and Insights Teams, Analytics and Insights, Sales etc.)


* Ensure integration of the DIJ into enterprise strategy and planning, drive value within our sales relationships and marketing activations, build external partnerships, and ensure accurate reporting/tracking of KPIs, etc.


**The concentration of effort across these components will ebb and flow depending on overall business** **needs.**

  



The base compensation range for this position is $110,000-$130,000 commensurate with experience. Danone North America additionally offers a performance-based bonus and has a strong benefits package including Medical, Dental, Vision, Prescription Drug Coverage, 401k Plan, Wellness Program, Life Insurance, Tuition Reimbursement, Flexible Time Off, and Paid Parental Bonding Leave, among other benefit plan options.


About you
**Who are we looking for?**



We are looking for a leader with a passion and track record for leveraging strategic insights and analytics to unlock transformational impact for business and for society. Someone with a track record of working across mission and sustainability topics and finding solutions to tackle society’s most pressing challenges through innovative solutions, programs, and partnerships. Someone with exposure to both the public and private sector, and with the ability to work outside of the M&S perspective to lead cross-functional working groups to identify win-win solutions across all stakeholders, both internal and external.



Someone who focuses on strategy-first but is also able to drive the full scope of project implementation needs independently. The ideal candidate is self-motivated and proactive and able to work independently on both strategy and project management from inception to delivery, with limited oversight.


**Key Experience:**


* 5-8+ years of relevant experience, with minimum 2-4 years at a top-tier strategy consulting or social impact consulting firm, in an internal strategy or mission/sustainability team, or other relevant CPG industry experience


* B.S./B.A. (required) in Business or Social Impact/Sustainability, or related field


* MBA (preferred) in Strategy and/or Social Impact/Sustainability Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (required):


* Strong problem-solving capabilities to generate actionable insights from a wide array of qualitative and quantitative inputs and data in the spirit of “getting to the answer”


* Ability to set the strategic framework for what data and analyses are needed to answer a “big picture” question, and fluency in Excel and with modeling to deliver on the analyses and generate senior leadership presentations and communications.


* Excellent written and verbal communication skills, particularly in developing presentations and leading action-oriented conversations with senior leaders


* Prior subject matter expertise over multiple years in one of more of our impact topics (Nature, Health, Communities), driving both project management and strategy development and implementation


* Demonstrated track record working with cross-functional teams and understanding and problem-solving for competing needs and roles by building deep relationships and influencing the outcomes


* Flexible/adaptable in a highly dynamic business environment with competing priorities (i.e., impeccable time management, organizational and prioritization skills); comfortable with ambiguity


* Ability to travel up to 25%, as needed
