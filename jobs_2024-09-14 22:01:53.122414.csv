Our area of focus is to develop a human resource role to oversee our growing and diversified workforce and understand and define our risk that may occur in our gyms or within the company. This is a very critical role and the role would be at the same organizational level of those that operate all of the locations.

  

To be successful in this role, a candidate must have significant experience in human resources or in risk management.

  

As with all of our management positions, one must be an independent, motivated person, while at the same time able to work within a small but great team.

  

This candidate should possess technical skills, communication skills, the ability to organize and be able to meet or exceed scheduled completion dates. We are a progressive employer with competitive salary and benefits. This job is not a work from home position as most of the tasks require a hands on approach within the facilities.
