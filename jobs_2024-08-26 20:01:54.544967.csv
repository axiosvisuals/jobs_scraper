* The patient’s needs always come first.
* Every team member understands that they have the power to do what it takes to create an exceptional customer and patient experience.
* Contentious issues are dealt with and resolved as they occur, or as soon as is possible.
* exceptional teamwork and commitment to shared goals benefits the entire organization.

**Essential Job Functions**

*The incumbent must be able to perform all the following duties and responsibilities* w*ith or without reasonable accommodation:*

* Assume primary responsibility for answering the practice phone and routing calls appropriately.
* Maintain hospital appointment calendar including scheduling appointments from callers or visitors and reviewing on-line bookings.
* Greet all visitors to the practice; greet clients and patients by name as they arrive for appointments and notify technical staff when they arrive. Monitor wait times and make accommodation as necessary during peak/busy times, or when medical staff is dealing with an emergency situation.

**Other Duties and Responsibilities**

**Nature of Supervision**

In all activities related to the care and handling of patients and clients, the Hospital Concierge will take direct supervision from the Hospital Office Manager and Hospital Leader on Duty

**Planning and Problem Solving**

Like all team members, the Concierge plays a crucial role in ensuring that day-to-day operation of the hospital is efficient and provides an optimal experience for our patients, and clients. The Concierge has the primary responsibility of consistently ensuring that the hospital workflow is optimized, which may require rescheduling appointments as well as maintaining an open line of communication with clients who are present in the practice and may need to wait longer than expected due to unforeseen circumstances (emergencies, etc.). The Concierge must ensure that the scheduled appointment duration is situation-appropriate (i.e. consider number of pets, sick/vs. well, etc.).


This role is unique in the hospital in that the Concierge will often be the first or last person dealing with upset or even potentially unhappy clients. This role requires an individual who is compassionate yet adaptable and flexible, and capable of not only doing what it takes to make the client’s and pet’s experience in our hospital optimal but also ensuring that the medical staff can focus on delivering excellent care. At times when these goals may seem to be at odds, it is the job of the Concierge to formulate strategies that accomplish both.

**Impact**

This position will impact the organization by contributing to the growth of productive practice while focusing on a high-quality standard of care. From an overall hospital organizational standpoint, this position is critical to ensuring that our client’s first and last impressions of our facility and staff are optimal.

**Supervisory Responsibility**

This position has no immediate supervisory duties.

**Education/Experience**

* High school diploma is a requirement.
* Must have at least 1 year's previous experience working in veterinary practice or a customer-facing role in another organization.
* Must have excellent written and verbal communication skills.
* Must be compassionate and sympathetic and be able to maintain a professional attitude and demeanor during emotional and stressful situations.
* Must have exceptional telephone and computer skills.
* Must be a team player willing to learn new techniques and treatments, offer creative ideas, and accept change.
* Preferred: Previous experience using a Practice Management System

**Title:** Medical Scribe (Full-time in Primary Care Setting)


The minimum and maximum base hourly wage for this position is $19.88. This base pay does not include additional forms of compensation including bonuses, overtime, etc. **Role Description**


The purpose of a Medical Scribe at Oak Street Health is to support our primary care providers with clinical documentation so that they can focus on providing exceptional care to our patients. Scribes assist providers throughout the patient care journey - huddling each morning to plan for the day's visits, joining them in the exam room to observe and document, and touching base after the visit to assist with next steps.

  

Beyond the typical Scribe role, these important care team members serve as clinical documentation assistants to their paired provider. Internally, we call them CISs (Clinic Informatics Specialists) in recognition of their important role in supporting accurate, specific, and timely clinical documentation. In addition to observing and documenting all patient encounters in real time, our Scribes become experts in our value-based care model and the documentation and care of chronic conditions, including ICD-10 and CPT coding. Scribes use this expertise to help providers identify and help close care gaps. Scribes receive extensive on-the-job training in clinical workflows, value-based medicine, preventative care for chronic conditions, accurate and specific documentation, population health data streams, and team based care.

  

Because our patients and providers rely on our Scribes, the ideal candidate should commit at least 1-2 years to this role. This is an excellent opportunity for pre-med track individuals looking to gain practical, paid experience in a clinical setting before applying to an MD/DO/PA/NP program, as well as those pursuing careers in Health Informatics, Public Health, Healthcare Administration, Medical Coding, and other related fields.

VOICE Charter School (http://www.voicecharterschool.org/) is an elementary and middle school located in Long Island City, Queens that serves about 650 students across grades K-8. We are located just minutes from Manhattan (two stops outside of Manhattan on the F, N, and W train lines) and Long Island City’s growing waterfront district, thriving arts community, and rapid residential growth. We are looking to identify extraordinary educators and administrators committed to urban education who wish to join a dynamic professional learning community.

Our mission is to create a safe and healthy learning environment that will nurture, motivate and challenge all of our children to achieve the highest level of academic excellence and to develop into mindful, responsible, contributing participants in their education, their community and the diverse society in which we live.

What makes VOICE different?

At VOICE, it’s not just about the music. It’s about the people. It’s about what you can be. It’s about using your passion. It’s about relationships. It’s about having the opportunity to choose. It’s about caring enough. It’s about each individual child and adult.

We believe in efficacy. At the core of our academic culture is the idea that all students are capable of doing well in any discipline. At VOICE, all students will learn – being smart is not something that you are, it is something you become. At VOICE, you will be pushed to become more.

We support and develop the effectiveness of our teachers. We believe that teachers need time to collaborate to build their practice, so we provide our team with over two hours of planning time a day as well as additional days for collaborative thought partnership and planning during the school year.

We promote participation in music and the arts. As music and art help develop problem solving and critical thinking skills and open children's imaginations, all VOICE students participate in and learn from daily activities in the arts including rigorous choral training. We design our arts-integrated curriculum to bring joy and wonder to the lives of our children, providing them with the skills necessary to forge their own path.

All Staff at VOICE:

* Love and nurture all of our students as they become deeply caring and responsible individuals;
* Take personal responsibility and work collaboratively to ensure that all students achieve and grow, understanding that the performance and progress of our students is directly under our control;
* Ask questions and empower students to exercise curiosity and wonder about the world around them;
* Hold themselves to the highest standards;
* Push and support themselves, their students, and their colleagues;
* Proactively seek and incorporate feedback;
* Help each individual child gain the opportunity to choose what his or her future will be.
