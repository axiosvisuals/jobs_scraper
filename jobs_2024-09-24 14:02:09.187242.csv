**What is the Acton Academy of Bergen County?**

Acton Academy of Bergen County (AABC) is a private, learner-driven micro-school with the mission of supporting its learners in finding their calling to change the world**.** AABC is also an independent affiliate of the Acton Academy network of schools (a celebrated network of learner-driven micro-schools and the fastest-growing independent-school network globally).

Since launching in 2019, AABC has more than tripled its learner population and continues to be growing rapidly.

This is an opportunity to join our successful small-business, entrepreneurial founders and growing team of passionate, hardworking guides.

Acton Academy of Bergen County (https://www.actonbergen.org/) is seeking an Elementary Guide. In collaboration with the guide team, the Elementary Guide will oversee a class (a.k.a., “studio”) of up to 30 students.

It is the Guide’s responsibility to:

* Prepare the studio environment so that expectations are clear and learners are set up for success.
* Practice the Socratic method at all times (i.e., instead of answering questions, guiding students to find the answers themselves).
* Launch project-based learning activities (a.k.a., “quests”).
* Guide students in self-governance, goal-setting, and progress-tracking.
* Guide children in creating meaningful portfolios of work.
* Model what it means to be an independent lifelong learner on a hero’s journey.
* Uphold Acton’s core beliefs and promises to its students and families.
* Manage administrative tasks such as scheduling guest speakers, taking behind-the-scenes photos, supervising field trips, etc.
* Write weekly studio updates to share with parents and post to the school’s blog.
* Meet and communicate effectively with parents, as needed.

**Preferred Experience and Skills:**

We seek an individual with a deep curiosity about life, a lifelong love of learning, and an entrepreneurial spirit (must thrive in a startup environment).

We seek someone who:

* Has proven excellence in guiding children (in or out of a school environment).
* Has an evident passion for the Hero’s Journey.
* Models a growth mindset and loves experimenting, evaluating, and improving upon everything they do.
* Has deep respect for all children; empathy for the challenges children face; and a commitment to the peaceful, compassionate limit setting.
* Is a quick, independent learner who can take direction and run with it, requiring little direct supervision/guidance once goals have been communicated.
* Has proven excellence in written and oral communications.
* Is gifted in assessing and positively influencing group dynamics.

* Is proficient with Google Education tools and conducting online research.

### **About Meta:**


Meta builds technologies that help people connect, find communities, and grow businesses. When Facebook launched in 2004, it changed the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world. Now, Meta is moving beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality to help build the next evolution in social technology. People who choose to build their careers by building with us at Meta help shape a future that will take us beyond what digital connection makes possible today—beyond the constraints of screens, the limits of distance, and even the rules of physics.
