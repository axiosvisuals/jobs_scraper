Since our beginnings as part of the iconic Greenwich Village retail store, Balducci’s, Baldor has maintained its original promise – curate and deliver the best ingredients from around the world. For 25 years, we have served the food industry using cutting edge logistics to create a seamless customer experience. Our commitment to service and quality has made us the first choice in distribution for a diverse list of industry leaders that includes hotels, restaurants, county clubs, hospitals, and in the last seven years Baldor has achieved consistent double-digit growth in addition to geographic, category, product, and channel expansion.

  


**Position Summary**



At Baldor, our marketing team is responsible for raising awareness, favorability and revenue for the company via communication with our core customer segments (restaurants, retailers, and corporations) and the vendors who make the products we sell. As the head of partnerships, you will be responsible for a critical part of this goal: helping our vendor partners—the farmers and producers who make the food we sell-build awareness with our chef partners, through targeted and compelling marketing campaigns.

  



As the lead on partnerships, you will ensure that we have a comprehensive package of marketing deliverables—including vendor shows, sampler packs, dedicated emails, boosted website search, website ads, chef dinners, and more-to offer to our vendors to help them create visibility for their products on Baldorfood.com. You will manage pricing, then pitch these options to new vendors and look to upsell existing partners. You will work with colleagues within the marketing team to ensure that these deliverables are completed, and manage approvals with vendors. You will hold regular business review meetings, in which you communicate back to vendors about the performance of these various marketing assets. You will work toward a sales target for the year. You will also manage partner sponsorship for Baldor events, including our tentpole Baldor Bite, a biannual trade show that aims to introduce more than 3,000 restaurant chefs, grocery executives, and food industry thought leaders to our vendors. Last year’s event included speakers like Union Square Hospitality Group’s Danny Meyer and Tatiana Executive Chef Kwame Onwuachi as well as 200 vendor booths.

  



This is very much a sales role, but we at Baldor approach sales with customer centricity, a focus on authentic relationship building, and solution-orientation.

**Responsibilities**


+ Maintain a pitch deck of marketing deliverables, reviewing to ensure we have offerings that meet vendor needs and that the pricing is rationalized against competition, cost of work, and supply/demand to maximize profitability.

* Own business development—which includes maintaining relationships with Merchandising team, meeting with new vendors within three months of onboarding, and offering some “try before you buy” deliverables
* Understand client’s needs and develop custom offerings that increase the spend year over year.
* Ensure deliverables are completed to the satisfaction of the vendors, working with the rest of the marketing team as needed to get these made and scheduled.
* Support the development of new programs, such as sampling boxes, working cross-functionally to execute
* Build and nurture vendor relations in such a way that client sees value of the marketing partnership; schedule biannual business reviews with vendors to report on performance.
* Build and manage a strategic event marketing program around BITE, vendor shows, customer dinners and more.
* Manage invoicing and collections against agreements

Paragon/SCIS has a legendary legacy standing tall in front of all critical assets of the United States of America. Protecting. Guarding. Serving.  

  

We have been protecting our nation throughout history. For more than 150 years, our means have evolved but our purpose to protect our nation has remained intact, touching millions of lives. From nuclear plants and government installations to specialized investigative services, we assure the country's safety and stability, relying on solid experience.  

  

We value diligence, professionalism, and honesty. We are proud to call ourselves Paragon/SCIS. Our company is a symbol of integrity; a reflection of each individual that composes it. We have built our reputation because accountability is in our blood.
  
Paragon/SCIS is composed of over 14,000 employees, caring for one another and for the success of our clients and our company. Working on the same site together, we bond with our colleagues; every day, serving the same purpose with dedication and a vigilant eye.  

  

Our employees have diverse profiles: veterans, retired police officers, trained armed guards, professionals and experienced managers. Their background and strength of character are carefully vetted so when you join, you know that you have been selected and are amongst the best.  

  

From Armed Security officers to Mailroom Service Clerks and Fire Fighters, from Field Investigators to Site Supervisors, we all stand united to maintain order in the most critical infrastructures of our nation. With diligence, 24/7, we are the eyes and ears on the ground. We matter.  

  

Our work is demanding. We thrive in the midst of challenge. We are brave, organized, ready. And, we are rewarded for it with above market pay, comprehensive benefits and valuable training. We believe in the vital role that we play in society and the recognition we get from it fuels us.  

  

Our values are the foundation of our operations. They are summarized in three words: Integrity, Vigilance and Helpfulness.  

  

Integrity  

  

A Paragon/SCIS employee is honest and therefore trusted to work unsupervised on the customer's premises and with valuables. Paragon/SCIS never compromises in its demand for integrity. Integrity also includes openly expressing one's opinion, reporting improprieties and not withholding information.  

  

Vigilance  

  

Professionalism entails seeing, hearing and evaluating, and a Paragon/SCIS employee is always attentive. Professionals develop an intuition that helps us to notice things that others don't. Their vigilance is needed in order to stay aware of potential risks or incidents that are taking place on our customers' premises.  

  

Helpfulness  

  

Helpfulness is about our employees always being ready to assist within the context of a particular assignment.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Securitas","https://www.securitasinc.com/","Stockholm, Stockholm","10,000+","more than $10B (USD)","Security.
