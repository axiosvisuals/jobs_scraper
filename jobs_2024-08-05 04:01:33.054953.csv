The programs are fun, instructional and non-competitive.

We have openings for new coaches in Passaic County for our upcoming Fall season. We'll be holding our program in over 150 locations throughout NJ and we have averaged approx. 5,000 children in prior years. So there is plenty of work to be had for the right person.

Our typical coach works about 4-5 hours per week.

A potential candidate will have experience in both organized sports (playing, coaching, etc.) and working with children in a group setting (teaching, coaching, camp counseling, etc.). Most importantly, they will have the right personality and demeanor to work with young children. By this, we mean that they are energetic, upbeat, charismatic and the type of person that can captivate a group of 3 to 5-yr. olds for a 1-hour soccer session. While a background in soccer is preferred, if you don't have that, but have participated in other organized sports, that can work as well.

Interested candidates should include a cover letter with their resume listing ALL of the following. If you don't provide ALL of the information requested, you will not be viewed as a serious candidate.

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/U--haul","http://www.uhaul.com/","2727 North Central Avenue
