**Core Program Beliefs**



The following beliefs are essential commitments for our staff team:


* We believe that within each of us is a desire to move towards health and achievement, under the right conditions. It is our job to provide young people with those conditions.
* We believe that every young person wants to love and be loved. It is our job to love these young people, and to help them learn to love themselves and others.
* We believe in the power of belonging. It is a core human condition to want to be missed when we are gone. We will miss young people when they are absent, and we will express that: “We didn’t see you yesterday. We missed you. We are glad you are back”. We will make sure every young person belongs in our community. No matter what. “She drew a circle to shut me out. Heretic, rebel, a thing to flout. But love and I had the wit to win. We drew a circle that took her in” (Edwin Markham)
* We accept young people for who they are. Right here. Right now. They do not have to change to be respected and loved and valued and be a member of our community. Behavior is not a condition of their worth as human beings.
* We believe that every young person wants to be in charge of their own life. To that end, we will give young people a voice in this program, and choices of how to best accomplish their goals.
* We are hungry to understand if our interventions are having the intended impact. We will be meticulous in our data entry, and ruthless in our hunt to understand the data and learn from it. If what we are doing is not working, we will set aside our egos, intentions and preconceived notions and we will change what we are doing.
* We believe that the young people with whom we work deserve our full attention and our best selves. Therefore, we will: NOT allow our personal beliefs or baggage to interfere with our work; we will commit to doing excellent work all the time on behalf of our young people; we will be honest and transparent with ourselves, our colleagues and our partners. To be very clear, by working in this program we are committing to:
	+ Engaging in self-care outside of work so that our personal issues don’t interfere with our ability to focus on our young people;
	+ Open communication - Bringing all issues directly back to the person OR to the group session in a way that fosters a healthy team;
	+ Learning our craft before practicing on our youth;
	+ Giving and receiving honest feedback, even if it is uncomfortable to hear or say

**Working Conditions**



* Work will be performed inside of Stamford High School or Westhill High School or alternative venue as established by the Director
* Home visits and community outreach work will be performed in environments not controlled by Domus, some of which may be high risk at times.
* Expect to work a school day/year as established by the Director and at times a non-standard workday. This is a 12-month position.
* Work will be under the supervision of the Director with periodic performance appraisals
* Will be working with faculty, staff, and administrators in a team-teaching approach as well as at school organized or sponsored events","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Domus-Kids","http://www.domuskids.org","Stamford","51 to 200","$5M to $25M (USD)","","","","",""
