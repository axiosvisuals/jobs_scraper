""About Dave's Hot Chicken  

  

Dave’s Hot Chicken was created by best friends Dave Kopushyan, Arman Oganesyan, and Tommy and Gary Rubenyan. Dave, a chef trained in Thomas Keller’s (French Laundry) organization set out to create the perfect Hot Chicken by searching, tasting, and frying. The four friends scrounged up $900 to put a tiny stand in an East Hollywood parking lot. The menu was simple, and the chicken was the star. And what chicken it is! Sourced and prepared to be the juiciest and most tender imaginable with each piece topped with Dave’s own mix of spices ranging from No Spice to “The Reaper.”

You'll work with small business owners via phone to determine their needs and aspirations and customize every sale to help make those happen.

### **What We're Looking For in You**


* You have an appetite for learning! You're keen on turning training and feedback into action and continuous self-improvement- you don't take rejection personally.
* Multi-tasking is no biggie. You're confident in navigating between numerous tabs, multiple screens, and using video conferencing tools.
* You're savvy and can find your way around new tools and software (such as Google Suite & Salesforce).
* You're naturally curious and like to ask as many questions as it takes to find the answer.
* You're excited about being part of a team with colleagues from other states, and you find it just as easy to chat with your teammates during a virtual conference as an in-person meeting.
* You are committed to a high standard of integrity and being a teamplayer is important to you.
* You're an excellent listener, assertive, persistent, and persuasive - show us your grit!
* You are genuinely curious about people, local businesses, and possess the innate ability to inspire passion in others- you can't wait to show everyone the value of Yelp.
* You are adaptable and can think on your feet. When faced with new challenges, or tough conversations, failure simply isn't an option.

***Social Work Services at the Mount Sinai Hospital***  

  

The Mount Sinai Hospital is a 1,134-bed facility with an extensive outpatient and specialty care network and is the largest hospital in the Mount Sinai Health Care System. It offers comprehensive social work services and programming to meet the myriad needs of the diverse populations we serve. We believe that total patient care must emphasize the physical, emotional, and social needs of each patient and their care partners. Social Workers collaborate within interprofessional teams to serve patients and the larger community from both a micro and macro level including both direct care and prevention. Founded in 1907, the Department of Social Work Services at the Mount Sinai Hospital is one of the oldest hospital social work departments in the nation with over 450 licensed social workers employed across more than 65 different program/service areas. Employment in our department provides a pathway to LCSW licensure as well as access to a broad range of continuing education, professional development and extra-curricular opportunities.

  



The Social Worker, under general supervision, assists patients and their families in understanding illness and disabilities and resolving personal, financial and environmental difficulties which interfere with obtaining maximum benefits from medical care. Specific duties may vary by area assigned. The Social Worker develops collaborative relationships with other disciplines to assure effective patient care.

Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE: RSG) is a leader in the environmental services industry. We provide customers with the most complete set of products and services, including recycling, waste, special waste, hazardous waste and field services. Our industry-leading commitments to advance circularity and support decarbonization are helping deliver on our vision to partner with customers to create a more sustainable world.


In 2023, Republic’s total company revenue was $14.9 billion, and adjusted EBITDA was $4.4 billion. We serve 13 million customers and operate more than 1,000 locations, including collection and transfer stations, recycling and polymer centers, treatment facilities, and landfills.


Although we operate across North America, the collection, recycling, treatment, or disposal of materials is a local business, and the dynamics and opportunities differ in each market we serve. By combining local operational management with standardized business practices, we drive greater operating efficiencies across the company while maintaining day-to-day operational decisions at the local level, closest to the customer.


Our customers, including small businesses, major corporations and municipalities, want a partner with the expertise and capabilities to effectively manage their multiple recycling and waste streams. They choose Republic Services because we are committed to exceeding their expectations and helping them achieve their sustainability goals. Our 41,000 team members understand that it's not just what we do that matters, but how we do it.


Our company values guide our daily actions:

* **Safe**: We protect the livelihoods of our colleagues and communities.
* **Committed to Serve**: We go above and beyond to exceed our customers’ expectations.
* **Environmentally Responsible:** We take action to improve our environment.
* **Driven**: We deliver results in the right way.
* **Human-Centered:** We respect the dignity and unique potential of every person.


We are proud of our high employee engagement score of 86. We have an inclusive and diverse culture where every voice counts. In addition, our team positively impacted 4.6 million people in 2023 through the Republic Services Charitable Foundation and local community grants. These projects are designed to meet the specific needs of the communities we serve, with a focus on building sustainable neighborhoods.

**STRATEGY**


Republic Services’ strategy is designed to generate profitable growth. Through acquisitions and industry advancements, we safely and sustainably manage our customers’ multiple waste streams through a North American footprint of vertically integrated assets.


We focus on three areas of growth to meet the increasing needs of our customers: recycling and waste, environmental solutions and sustainability innovation.


With our integrated approach, strengthening our position in one area advances other areas of our business. For example, as we grow volume in recycling and waste, we collect additional material to bolster our circularity capabilities. And as we expand environmental solutions, we drive additional opportunities to provide these services to our existing recycling and waste customers.

**Recycling and Waste**


We continue to expand our recycling and waste business footprint throughout North America through organic growth and targeted acquisitions. The 13 million customers we serve and our more than 5 million pick-ups per day provide us with a distinct advantage. We aggregate materials at scale, unlocking new opportunities for advanced recycling. In addition, we are cross-selling new products and services to better meet our customers’ specific needs.

**Environmental Solutions**


Our comprehensive environmental solutions capabilities help customers safely manage their most technical waste streams. We are expanding both our capabilities and our geographic footprint. We see strong growth opportunities for our offerings, including PFAS remediation, an increasing customer need.

 **SUSTAINABILITY INNOVATION**


Republic’s recent innovations to advance circularity and decarbonization demonstrate our unique ability to leverage sustainability as a platform for growth.


The Republic Services Polymer Center is the nation’s first integrated plastics recycling facility. This innovative site processes rigid plastics from our recycling centers, producing recycled materials that promote true bottle-to-bottle circularity. We also formed Blue Polymers, a joint venture with Ravago, to develop facilities that will further process plastic material from our Polymer Centers to help meet the growing demand for sustainable packaging. We are building a network of Polymer Centers and Blue Polymer facilities across North America.


We continue to advance decarbonization at our landfills. As demand for renewable energy continues to grow, we have 70 landfill gas-to-energy projects in operation and plan to expand our portfolio to 115 projects by 2028.
