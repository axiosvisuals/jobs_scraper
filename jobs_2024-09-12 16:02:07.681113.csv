CPST services must be part of the treatment plan, which includes goals and activities necessary to correct or ameliorate conditions discovered during the initial assessment visits. CPST is a face-to-face intervention with the child/youth (required), family/caregiver or other collateral supports. This is a multi-component service that consists of therapeutic interventions such as counseling, as well as functional supports.

Activities are “hands on” and task oriented, intended to achieve the identified goals or objectives as set forth in the child/youth’s individualized treatment plan.

PSR activities are focused on addressing the rehabilitative needs of the child/youth as part of a treatment plan and can be provided in coordination with treatment interventions by a licensed practitioner (e.g. OLP) or provider of CPST.
