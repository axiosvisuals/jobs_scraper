Our broad and deep talent/resource pool enables us to provide clients with a rich range of high-quality tutoring and personal coaching at very reasonable rates.

We understand that as students progress through life, their development involves more than academics. They develop dispositions that endure over time and significantly affect how they define, approach, and carry out their roles in their personal, career, and community lives. With so much at stake, it is important to provide students with the supports they need to experience success. Achieving success engenders a sense of self-efficacy - a ""can do"" attitude - and strengthens the ties between students and the world around them. In appreciation of this conceptual backdrop, Actual Solutions has committed itself to identifying, seizing, and maximizing opportunities to support families, schools, and student success.

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/U--haul","http://www.uhaul.com/","2727 North Central Avenue
