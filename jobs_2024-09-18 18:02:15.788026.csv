**About the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Peace**

The Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Peace was founded in Nottingham, England in 1884 by Mother Francis Clare (Margaret Anna Cusack). She was a woman deeply moved by the social conditions of her times and the plight of poor and oppressed people. She is a historic figure and was a prolific author in her own time, writing histories of Ireland, lives of the saints, and social reform.

The Sisters of St Joseph of Peace continue a rich heritage devoted to promoting social justice as a way to peace. From the beginning we have involved ourselves in ministries of social service, education and health care, working directly with the poor and sick, providing housing and care for women, orphans and blind children and adults, and, as need arose, established schools and hospitals. Recent Chapter directions have committed the congregation to nonviolence, care of creation, radical hospitality, anti-racism, inclusion, and interculturality. The Congregation has also committed to implement the *Laudato Si’ Action Plan.*

The Congregation consists of three geographic regions: one in the United Kingdom and two in the United States (East and Pacific Northwest). The headquarters of the Congregation is in New Jersey. Our Congregation Office is located on the campus of St. Michael Villa in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.

We value our lay employees who work with us and help us accomplish our mission.

Marc Torres has established himself as a successful State Farm agent for over 15 years in Linden, NJ. He has a unique ability to relate, train and develop his team members because he himself started as a Team Member at a State Farm Agency over 20 years ago.

During his tenure as an agent he has earned many awards (Chairman's Circle, SVP Club, Life Ambassador Club, Silver Honor Club and Small Business Leaders) but his proudest accomplishments have been supporting multiple team members to advance to opening their own agencies.

**WHO ARE WE?**

A “new school” law firm.

We work with business owners and entrepreneurs in the areas of business/corporate law, employment law, and related litigation. Our firm was founded just over 5 years ago with a vision of practicing law in an enjoyable, and better, way. We have fun and work hard.

Our main office is in Morristown, NJ. The position will be a “hybrid” of in-person and remote work.

**WHO ARE YOU?**

You have at least three years of corporate/transactional experience at a law firm. This includes drafting, revising, and negotiating various sorts of commercial agreements such as service agreements, MSAs, NDAs, vendor agreements, partnership agreements, and the like. Experience with mergers and acquisitions and entity formation is preferred, but not required.

You understand the role of the lawyer in providing legal, yet practical, advice – focused on the realities and needs of a business. You know how to advise your client without “over-lawyering” it. You know how to interpret a contract, but also how to explain it to a client in a clear, non-legalese way.

You have excellent leadership, communication, and interpersonal skills.

**KEY RESPONSIBILITIES**

· Draft, negotiate, and advise on a wide range of commercial agreements, ensuring both legal and business objectives are met.

· Represent buyers and sellers of businesses through various stages of the deal – from letter of intent and due diligence to the closing table.

· Advise entrepreneurs on business formation and startup matters – including entity formation, foundational agreements, and strategies for mitigating risk.

· Counsel clients on various business and legal risks, identifying potential concerns and opportunities and explaining to clients in a clear, concise manner.

**OUR CULTURE**

We've worked for other firms and we've seen some...""stuff"". A boring, and predictably unexciting relationship with clients is the opposite of how we approach work. We launched our firm in 2019 with a vision of practicing law in a more enjoyable, and better way. A way where you have a work/life balance, you actually enjoy your co-workers and clients, and enjoy what you do.

Join us if you want to experience a better way of doing things.
