### **Deadline**

Sep 19, 2024 at 11:59 PM Eastern Time
### **Description**

The Bergelson lab at NYU Biology is looking for highly motivated and independent individuals to work as Postdoctoral Associates. More than one candidate may be recruited.



Each position is for a post-PhD trainee preparing for a research scientist career path. The planned position will provide a transition to career independence through the development of professional skills; supervision by senior scientist incorporating individual development plan in support of training goals and those of faculty mentor; and publication of research findings/scholarship during postdoc appointment period.



Projects in the Bergelson lab generally investigate the ecology and evolution of plant–pathogen interactions, focusing primarily on *Arabidopsis thaliana* and its relatives, and the bacteria that reside within them. The approach is interdisciplinary, drawing upon tools from molecular genetics, molecular evolution, ecological and evolutionary theory, computation, field biology, chemistry, and population genetics to understand how ecological interactions shape evolutionary dynamics.



The research responsibilities of each Postdoctoral Associate will primarily focus on the pathogen communities of *Arabidopsis thaliana* and associated host plants*.* We are particularly interested in disentangling the impacts of pathogen population dynamics and interactions on the composition of host associated microbial assemblages. Specific focal areas and techniques will be developed in collaboration with the Postdoctoral Associate, but will make use of our extensive datasets and resources to address fundamental questions in how ecological interactions, evolutionary dynamics, metabolic interdependencies and/or the biology of hosts and host-associated microbiomes shape pathogen populations.



Each position will benefit from an association with collaborative projects that seek to use the lens of molecular evolution, community ecology and metabolomics to build a conceptual bridge between a mechanistic understanding of interactions and broad-scale patterns. The overarching project embraces the complexity of these communities, and aims to explain real-world patterns through experimental observations, comparative genomics and functional assays. The Postdoctoral Associate will actively participate in these collaborative efforts within an international team.



In compliance with NYC’s Pay Transparency Act, the annual base salary range for this position is $60K - $80K. New York University considers factors such as (but not limited to) the specific grant funding and the terms of the research grant when extending an offer.

  



### **Qualifications**

The ideal candidate will hold a PhD; have prior research experience in ecology, with skills or a willingness to obtain skills in theory, sequencing, fieldwork and/or high throughput assays of interactions. The candidate must also have a firm grasp of ecological and evolutionary principles. A track record of peer-reviewed publications is desirable.



### **Application Instructions**

Please upload your application materials via Interfolio. Include the following items: 1) CV including a list of publications; 2) a short summary of your research interests in the form of a cover letter; 3) a list of three references and their contact information.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/New-York-University","https://www.nyu.edu","50 West 4th Street
