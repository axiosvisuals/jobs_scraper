We are looking for a self-motivated, organized individual who is passionate about patient care and excited for the opportunity to independently manage their cases with confidence and accountability. As a Peritoneal Dialysis Registered Nurse (PD RN), you will be providing education on peritoneal dialysis to your patients and their care partners in a clinical setting, which then allows them to dialyze from home.


You have responsibility over the complete ongoing care of each patient to ensure their treatment stays on track.


Dialysis Experience is NOT required. Nephrology nursing provides a fresh lens and set of skills to those newly entering the field.

**What you can expect:**

* Provide comprehensive patient care in an independent setting.
	+ Apply your ""core"" nursing skills to assess, diagnose and implement complete care plans as you look at the whole patient. As a case manager, you will also track and organize your patients. With the pride of ownership comes the joy of witnessing how your care impacts patients' lives.
* Empower your patients by teaching them to administer their own dialysis and to take their health back into their own hands.
	+ Training patients takes time and mental energy and the rewards of that investment come in seeing the transformation of your patients from feeling sick and afraid, to strong, independent, and able to do the daily things that they love. Educating patients on their options when it comes to dialysis not only helps them own their journey, but also expands the program to people who will benefit greatly from PD.
	+ *Home RN partners to provide ongoing dialysis treatment education activities supporting the healthy growth of the home program. This includes educating new in-center hemodialysis patients in the clinics.*
* Lead, coach and guide with your nursing skills.
	+ You will work independently, while also building deep relationships with patients, support systems and care partners.

**Schedule**

* Typically, an 8-hour day, Monday through Friday with weekends and holidays off!
* Flexibility as you manage your own cases and as a result, own your own schedule.
* Scheduled home visits and on-call shifts vary by program and are compensated accordingly.
