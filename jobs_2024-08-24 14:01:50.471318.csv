* As assigned, contribute to our daily Fast Takes feature by summarizing outside opinion pieces.

* Familiarity with right-of-center views on US politics and policy —and lefty ones, too. (Know the opposition!)
* A passion for political opinion.

Interested candidates should submit their resume, a cover letter, and a recent writing sample (preferred opinion clipping) for consideration.

From strategy through to implementation, we help put in place people, processes and technology so they can leverage financial risk management to identify new opportunities and pursue success as smoothly, systematically and sustainably as possible in the face of changing markets, technologies and competition. Our team provides our clients with gap assessments as well as design and implement processes to facilitate asset and liability management, funding and liquidity planning and stress testing, and capital management. You’ll help build tools that enable our clients to efficiently utilise capital and liquidity resources, consistent with regulatory expectations.  

To really stand out and make us fit for the future in a constantly changing world, each and every one of us at PwC needs to be a purpose-led and values-driven leader at every level. To help us achieve this we have the PwC Professional; our global leadership development framework. It gives us a single set of expectations across our lines, geographies and career paths, and provides transparency on the skills we need as individuals to be successful and progress in our careers, now and in the future.


As a Manager, you'll work as part of a team of problem solvers, helping to solve complex business issues from strategy to execution. PwC Professional skills and responsibilities for this management level include but are not limited to:

* Coach others, recognise their strengths, and encourage them to take ownership of their personal development.
* Analyse complex ideas or proposals and build a range of meaningful recommendations.
* Use multiple sources of information including broader stakeholder views to develop solutions and recommendations.
* Address sub-standard work or work that does not meet firm's/client's expectations.

* Manage a variety of viewpoints to build consensus and create positive outcomes for all parties.
* Simplify complex messages, highlighting and summarizing key points.
* Uphold the firm's code of ethics and business conduct.

  

A career in Capital Management, within Financial Services Advisory Risk & Regulatory, will allow you to advise financial institutions on continuing to enhance their stress testing capabilities and responding to regulatory feedback. As clients continue to enhance their capabilities, you will help clients to utilize stress testing as an integral tool for risk and capital management and as a driver of core business insights, rather than simply a regulatory requirement.
