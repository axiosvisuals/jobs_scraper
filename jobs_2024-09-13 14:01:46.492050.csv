The Administration for Children’s Services (ACS) protects and promotes the safety and well-being of children and families through child welfare and juvenile justice services and community supports.

The CARES approach engages families in an assessment of child safety and family needs by finding solutions to family problems and identifying informal and formal supports to meet family needs and increase parents’ ability to care for their children.

* Deliver CARES training to DCP staff, applying adult learning concepts to effectively engage participants of varying learning needs and styles.


- Provide onsite and virtual coaching to DCP CARES staff monthly to foster transfer of learning and support application of knowledge and skills to their daily practice which includes direct service, middle- management, and executive-level staff.  

* Shadow assigned CPS staff on visits in the community or virtually at least quarterly (e.g., family homes, schools, and community-based providers).
* Participate in the CARES case reviews and quality improvement processes and integrate findings into ongoing CARES CPS coaching.
* Partner with DCP to facilitate “Listening Tours” in the community, which provide an overview of CARES and its benefits for various stakeholders (e.g., DCP units, community service providers, DOE, NYPD, etc.).
* Generate monthly coaching reports to be disseminated to assigned CARES units and DCP Program Development.

Are you looking for a opportunity where you can use your experience to propel your career into management? At New York Life, we will invest in you from the start to help you learn and grow as a financial professional first. We’ll train you in valuable skills, such as marketing, business development, and customer relationship management, and provide you with the tools you need to further your career. Then we’ll train you and provide you with access to the tools you need for a career in management.

**What we’re looking for**  
We’re looking for people who want to make a lasting impact on the financial well-being of individuals, families, and small businesses—motivated people who can answer yes to one of the following questions:

* Do you have sales or managerial experience in another industry?
* Have you previously run your own business?
* Do you have an MBA or other equivalent degree?

In the Accelerated Path to Management Program, you’ll start off as a financial professional, learning how to sell our products, building client relationships, and meeting specific requirements1 before transitioning into a management role.  
You’ll then undergo a six-month intensive training program designed to prime you for success as a manager. You will use that experience to understand how to recruit and coach others to success.

**What we offer**

**Your first year**  
You’ll learn firsthand about a financial professional’s role and day-to-day work by working as a financial professional for the first year of your career journey with New York Life. We will provide you with complete training, access to digital tools, and a comprehensive product suite.

**Training and resources**  
You will receive top-notch training that will give you an understanding and appreciation for the strength and value of  
New York Life. Beyond this training and support, New York Life will provide access to the resources you need to succeed day-to-day, including experts on hand to answer your questions and a suite of digital sales, prospecting and marketing tools that will help you attract and retain your clients with web, social and email content.

**Product Solutions**  
You will learn about our robust products and services that can help clients and their families achieve their financial goals.  
Together with its subsidiaries, New York Life provides a range of competitive insurance and financial products, including life insurance, annuities, long-term care insurance, disability income insurance, and investment products such as mutual funds through our broker-dealer, NYLIFE Securities LLC (member of FINRA and SIPC), a Licensed Insurance  
Agency. You will be required to hold securities licenses and FINRA registrations and affiliate with NYLIFE Securities as a registered representative before you can offer investment products.

**Your transition to a Field Manager role**  
After meeting specific requirements for the first 12 months as a financial professional, you will enter a specialized six-month Associate Partner training program. We’ll help you to lead and build your team of financial professionals.  
Throughout your career journey with New York Life, you’ll continue to have opportunities to grow and be promoted to increasingly senior levels of management.

**How we will compensate you**  
When you begin with New York Life as a financial professional2, you will receive income that is commission-based.3

If you meet the requirements and approvals to become an Associate Partner, you will receive a salary. The salary range for an Associate Partner is $60,000–$150,000 (in California, the salary range is $62,400–$150,000), plus you will be eligible for additional compensation related to the agents you recruit and develop (“R&Ds”). R&Ds are additional compensation that is designed to increase your income and to reimburse for any reasonable and necessary expenses we do not otherwise reimburse. You will also be eligible for medical, dental, and vision benefits, life, long-term disability, and accidental death and dismemberment coverages, a pension plan,4 and a 401(k) savings plan.5

New York Life will value and reward your hard work and success. You’ll have significant income potential over time, because our field managers’ compensation is directly aligned with their recruiting performance and the production level of their team of financial professionals. The average income among our 586 recruiters at all levels in 2021 was $270,890.6

We tackle whatever challenges come our way. We have each other’s backs, we recognize our accomplishments, and we grow together. We celebrate and support one another – from big and small things in life to big career moments. And giving back is in our DNA (we get 10 days off each year to do just that).


We know that powering an inclusive future starts with us. Because without diversity and a dedication to equality, there is no moving forward. Our 30 Inclusive Communities, that bring people together around commonalities or passions, are leading the way. Together we’re committed to learning, listening, caring for our communities, whilst supporting the most vulnerable with a collective effort to make this world a better place either with technology, or through our actions.

Citizens Bankers are the face of the branch. They devote their time getting to know their customers and building lasting relationships by providing trusted advice.


**What you'll do**



Are you outgoing? Do you get satisfaction out of helping others and offering sound advice? If you’re a “people person” who enjoys building positive relationships with customers, then this is the job for you!



Using your strong communication and problem-solving skills — along with your broad range of financial knowledge — you’ll provide recommendations and assist customers with financial solutions, supporting spending, saving, borrowing and investing needs.

You’ll introduce customers to digital and mobile-first ways to handle banking transactions, like on our app or through our ATMs. You’ll collaborate with partners in Wealth Management, Mortgage and Business Banking to help customers with more complex financial needs.

Find a quiet place to record and be camera-ready. You’ll need a smartphone, tablet, or desktop computer with your camera and microphone enabled. You’ll answer questions, with 1 minute to prepare, 3 minutes to respond, and 1 opportunity to re-record. Share your skills and experience, and bring your personality to the interview.
