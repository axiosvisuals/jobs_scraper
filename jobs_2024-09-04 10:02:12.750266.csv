Blend Smoothie & Salad Bar is now hiring in a few locations. If you're outgoing, have food experience, excellent customer service and love health we would love to meet with you.


Crew members take care of the end-to-end ordering process, from asking customers about their orders to processing payment and preparing the requested food. For faster turnaround times, it’s common for crew members to work together as a team for each customer transaction and divide tasks among themselves. Task rotation happens regularly, so crew members experience several workstations, such as the front counter and kitchen. Compliance is a major aspect of the job, as they must ensure the cleanliness of the entire store and follow safety requirements and official procedures. Most crew members work part time, staying on their feet for long periods. Shifts depend on Blend Smoothie and Salad Bar’s opening hours, with overtime likely during lunch or other crowded periods.

**Process Orders**- The crew member is responsible for taking customer orders according to company guidelines. This involves requesting and verifying customers’ chosen food items, then operating cash registers to process payment. Crew members may also promote other Blend Smoothie and Salad Bar products using suggestive selling techniques.

**Prepare Food**- Because customers expect only a short waiting time, crew members must prepare and package food quickly without compromising quality, usually by complying with Blend Smoothie and Salad Bar’s recipes and procedures. They must also observe safety requirements and consider factors such as presentation, portion control, and special requests.

**Assist Customers-** During their entire shift, crew members strive to provide a high level of service. They greet customers warmly, answer basic inquiries about Blend Smoothie and Salad Bar and offer information about menu items, creating a comfortable environment through their courteous, respectful attitude.

**Maintain Blend Smoothie and Salad Bar Cleanliness**- Crew members keep their workstations clean and organized to satisfy company standards and ensure hygienic food preparation. Beyond this, some employers assign more general housekeeping duties to crew members, who may also inspect and maintain other parts of Blend Smoothie and Salad Bar, such as the kitchen, restrooms, or parking lot.

**Identify Problems**- Since crew members interact firsthand with customers, they’re in a prime position to look out for possible issues, such as excessively lengthy lines or inconvenient packaging and customers often turn to them when voicing their complaints. Crew members must know how to handle such situations and promptly relay these concerns to management.


Crew members are efficient and adaptable, catering to customers in record time and accomplishing their tasks calmly even during busy periods. They excel at following procedures and keeping track of details. In addition, crew members benefit from having the following skills:

**Customer Service** – crew members must be prepared for various scenarios, from routine order-taking to complaint resolution. To address inquiries properly, they should also be knowledgeable about menu items and Blend Smoothie and Salad Bar as a whole

**Accuracy** – crew members are attentive and thorough, double-checking orders and strictly abiding by instructions when preparing food. It’s essential to get every detail right, especially since they serve a queue of customers and mistakes may result in undesirable delays

**Teamwork** – working within a team is typical for crew members. They must communicate clearly and synchronize their workflow with others if they are to accomplish customer requests in a span of minutes

**Multitasking** – job duties for crew members are diverse. Given their fast-paced work environment, they should be excellent multitaskers who can switch fluidly between different kinds of activities and cope with high demand

**Physical dexterity** – crew members use their hands significantly, as their food preparation duties may entail cooking, cutting, and wrapping. Another physical requirement is standing for several hours

**Must** be able to **lift 50 pounds** or more.
