**Job Status:** Full-time Exempt  

**Supervisor:** Brigaid Regional Chef  

**Location:** Northeast (within 50 miles of a major airport), with 50% travel  

**Compensation:** $85,000 plus full benefits

  


**About Brigaid:** Founded by former *Noma* head chef Dan Giusti, Brigaid is a startup that began challenging the school food status quo by putting professional chefs into public schools to cook fresh, wholesome food from scratch. In 2016, we launched our first pilot program with the New London Public School district in New London, Connecticut. Since then, we’ve partnered with school districts around the country and expanded our reach into institutional kitchens of all kinds, equipping chefs to work within the parameters of federally-funded food assistance programs to provide organizations with practical solutions and hands-on training that facilitate improved outcomes for those they serve. We encourage you to learn more about our work by visiting our website, chefsbrigaid.com, and our Instagram, @brigaid.

 **About Position:** Over the past three years, the Brigaid team has grown exponentially–from five chefs in 2021 to over 60 in 2024. As business–and our impact in the institutional food space–continues to grow, we continue to partner with school districts around the country to bring hands-on, practical training instruction to their teams.

  

We’re hiring a Training Chef to travel to these districts to help them improve the overall quality of food offerings–and increase the amount of scratch cooking on the menu, maximize the value of current infrastructure, and increase student satisfaction. The Training Chef would serve as a short-term solution in the district, working closely with both district leadership and kitchen teams to plan and implement training in service of these goals. The Training Chef would also work on the ground to train teams at each school kitchen on organization, food safety, and basic cooking techniques in order to increase their scratch cooking capability.

 **Job Responsibilities:**


* Travel to various locations around the country to implement in-person Brigaid training. Your job will be to demonstrate the highest example in quality and food safety for training partners.
* Coordinate with food service directors on menu planning, grocery lists, equipment lists, staffing levels, and all aspects of planning training days.
* Become well versed in the Brigaid recipe template and recipe scaling.
* Use Brigaid training tools to teach signs.
* Utilize Google Calendar to manage your own travel and training schedule.
* Independently plan, manage, and document training while providing excellent organizational and time management skills and be self motivated.
* Be able to adapt quickly to changing environments and be flexible with your schedule and plans.
* Participate in regularly scheduled Zoom meetings with the Brigaid HQ team as needed.
* Follow all Brigaid/partner organization protocols and standards of conduct according to the Brigaid and organization handbooks.
* Adhere to all United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Department of Health (DOH) guidelines and regulations.

  


**Job Qualifications:**


* At least 5 years of professional cooking experience in a non-institutional setting, including at least 2 years in a kitchen supervisory role (high volume cooking experience is a plus).
* ServSafe Manager certified, or the ability to take a Brigaid-sponsored 8-hour ServSafe Manager course and pass the exam during the initial training period.
* Strong understanding of good food safety practices.
* Strong cooking ability, with understanding of all basic cooking techniques.
* Strong leadership and teaching skills.
* Ability to lead, direct, and inspire food service teams.
* Ability to use high volume kitchen equipment.
* Ability to follow recipes and use basic math to determine preparation quantities.
* Good verbal and communication skills.
* Well versed in USDA National School Lunch Program (NSLP) standards and regulations, or the ability to learn and adhere to these standards.
* Basic computer literacy, including Microsoft and Google programs and Zoom.
* Flexibility in accommodating emergencies or changes in schedule.
* Ability to work well under pressure and coordinate tasks.
* Ability to work well with others in a team environment.

  


**Physical Requirements:**


* Ability to travel between various training sites in a timely manner (and the possibility of carrying kitchen/culinary equipment during this travel).
* Ability to lift and carry heavy objects up to 50 pounds.
* Ability to walk around and stand for long periods of time.
* Proof of negative skin prick TB test is required.
* **Travel required:** 50%; must live in or be willing to move to the Northeast region, within 50 miles of a major airport.

  


**To Apply:**

 ***To be considered, please submit a resume.*** *The first round of the hiring process will be a Zoom interview, after which qualified candidates will be invited to a three-hour in-person practical interview in New London, Connecticut. To be considered, you must be able to attend this in-person interview. A travel stipend of $250 will be offered to each candidate living more than 120 miles away from New London. Should the final candidate for this position need to move, Brigaid also offers a one time, lump sum of $5,000 in relocation assistance, which is paid as part of the first paycheck and is subject to tax.*
