The Bareburger Mission is our North Star: our guiding light. That which helps guide us in a direction towards being extraordinary. In 2009 we had a very simple vision: let’s create the tastiest burger using local, organic, all natural & sustainable ingredients whenever possible.

Years later, we’re honored to serve clean food to our communities around the globe.  

Our greatest strength has always been creating a menu with choices that feel good for everyone. Thank you to all the partners, farmers, producers and distributors that we proudly call friends & family. We source mindfully, with our farmers, our environment and our guests in mind at all times. We will always look to the future of food and plant-based proteins which are undoubtedly at the forefront of sustainability. Our menu has plenty of plant-based options and is more delicious than ever. What we eat is who we are, and at Bareburger, we celebrate everyone.

We’ve discovered a unique approach that significantly enhances the dining experience. **Our trial run with a Michelin-starred restaurant in NYC showed an astonishing 4,344% increase in bookings within just 2 hours**.

We're extending our Beta in NY and are **seeking 3 SDRs to help us acquire additional test users on a** **1-month project**. You’ll **work remotely at the hours of your choosing** to **invite New York residents & commuters to test our service**. In return, we ask for their feedback to help us improve our platform and the UX.

You will choose one or several of the following target markets:

* **Corporate:** You will schedule appointments with CEOs, Owners, CFOs, Head of Operations, Head of Recruitments, Head of Employee Benefits and equivalents with our Account Executives to invite their company/colleagues to test our service and give us feedback.
* **Social media groups & influencers:** You will schedule appointments with Social Media Group Moderators/Leaders, Influencers and their Management Team with our Account Executives to invite their group members/followers to test our service and give us feedback.
* **Field marketing:** You will be part of a team bringing our offer to the market through creative field marketing sign up tactics, and good ol' fashion grass roots opportunities (aka hittin' the streets!)

**Top of Market Compensation & Growth Opportunities**

For this 1-month project we offer performance-based compensation, where your **earnings are tied to the number of sign-ups you generate**. On top of that, you’ll enjoy **perks like free meals at upscale restaurants**.

To clarify, you’ll have the **freedom to work from home and set your own hours**. We do not monitor or regulate how or when you work. However, please note that compensation is strictly tied to sign-ups—there is **no hourly pay for this 1-month project**. This model rewards those who dedicate at least 2 hours of work per day. On average, dedicating just 2 hours per day can earn you $2-3K, while **working 3-4 hours daily can easily result in $5-8K per month due to the attractiveness of our solution**.

Starting in **October 2024**, top performers will be offered a full-time contract with a monthly base salary of **$8K-$15K** (function of your performance), plus commissions and bonuses, as we prepare for our expansion.

**Please Note:**  
Do not apply unless you have at least **1 year of experience** in a similar role.

Revenue Operations at Parabola is responsible for architecting, building and managing our revenue engine. This team of one will partner with sales, marketing, and post-sales teams to create a seamless system (process and tools) that allows all functional teams to perform their best work.



This role is as strategic as it is tactical: this individual will be responsible for translating Parabola's GTM strategy and user journey into a backend revenue system architecture that drives both efficiency and scale. This team is also the point of contact for all of our revenue tools, ensuring that tools work in tandem, and that data between tools flows seamlessly, driving clear handoffs at every stage in the buyer journey. This is a critical position that ensures every member of the GTM team has the tools and data to do their best work and grow revenue for the business.


**About you:**



You are an operator at your core who is excited to architect, build and manage a best in class revenue system / RevOps function from the ground up. You should have deep operations experience across the revenue flywheel, having supported both marketing, sales and post-sales organizations in your career. Salesforce expertise is a must, and it would be helpful if you have experience managing Hubspot and/or another marketing automation tool. Experience in an early stage revenue operations function is also essential.



Our ideal candidate is an owner with a ""roll up your sleeves"" mentality to build systems that will allow us to achieve ongoing, sustainable success. This role has a broad scope, and candidates should be able to translate go-to-market strategy and our customer journey that allows our pre and post sale teams to perform their work at scale and with ease.


**What you'll be doing:**


* Own operations and systems strategy, tooling and integrations across marketing and sales (for a preview of our stack and philosophy, see Kyle Poyar’s “From random to unified GTM in 30 days”)
* Drive data quality, accessibility and CRM hygiene.
* Stand up ongoing KPI and reporting process.
* Partner with growth + bizdev to operationalize and scale functions - specifically with regard to tracking and automation efforts.


**What (we think) you'll need to do it**


* A minimum of 3 years of experience in RevOps, ideally in a fast-growing startup (must have experience in earlier stage-orgs). *Note: we are open to changing title and comp for more senior candidates.*
* Opinionated about what best-in-class ABX looks like, from building territories to account stage criteria.
* Salesforce admin with experience architecting a robust and actionable Salesforce instance.
* Experience with Hubspot, Marketo, or Salesforce Marketing Cloud.
* Experience in a PLG go-to-market organization.
* Highly collaborative, with real examples of how you’ve proactively built amazing relationships with your stakeholders/partners.
* Deep curiosity, grit, and ownership mindset around not only systems, but also pipeline growth and team performance.
* You're excited to join a hybrid team and work out of our SF or NYC office ~3 days a week.


Salary Range: $130,000 - $185,000

The present era is run by ancient players: Fidelity, Schwab, & Goldman Sachs. The problem is that none of them were built on modern rails and have horrible user experiences. There have been new things built (think: “investing apps”). They are either 1) gimmicky casinos or 2) sleepy commodities. We won’t say names. Why hasn’t anyone built a modern Goldman Sachs for everyone? That’s our mission.


Titan is a next-generation investment firm. We aspire to lead our generations’ wealth.


We are fighters at heart. We fight to build products that are truly democratized. For example, we launched the first institutional grade cash management product open to everyday investors via Titan Smart Cash. We launched the first ever Venture fund for everyday investors in partnership with Cathie Wood’s ARK. We’ve been able to raise significant capital from some of Silicon Valley’s best, like a16z and General Catalyst.

Our ideal candidate has a “no task is too small attitude,” is driven, organized, and has a passion for serving others. Sound like you? Keep reading!

 **What You’ll Do:**

* Respond and resolve customer requests and questions via chat, email, and scheduled phone calls
* Escalate customer issues and help develop best practices for efficient customer engagement
* Assist with incoming and outgoing transfers, money movements, and technical troubleshooting
* Work closely with Apex, our custodian, and be the middleman between them and our client
* Analyze current procedures and offer improvement suggestions to increase workflow accuracy and efficiency
* Translate customer needs into recommendations for engineering - this is an opportunity to learn the ropes of product management and directly influence the Titan roadmap

**Qualifications**

* **Hard Requirement**: Licensed (7 + 63/66)  

*Please do not apply if you are not licensed*
* 2+ years of experience in a Customer Success/Service role in the financial space  

*While experience in Transfers and Retirement is ideal, it is not required*
* Ability to work independently as well as in a team environment to meet stated goals and targets
* Demonstrated skill and ability to handle assorted customer questions and issues, including challenging matters, resourcefully and with completeness and empathy

Titan is the rebel challenger in a very old industry. The present era is run by ancient players: Fidelity, Schwab, & Goldman Sachs. The problem is that none of them were built on modern rails and have horrible user experiences. There have been new things built (think: “investing apps”). They are either 1) gimmicky casinos or 2) sleepy commodities. We won’t say names. Why hasn’t anyone built a modern Goldman Sachs for everyone? That’s our mission.


Titan is a next-generation investment firm. We aspire to lead our generations’ wealth.


We are fighters at heart. We fight to build products that are truly democratized. For example, we launched the first institutional grade cash management product open to everyday investors via Titan Smart Cash. We launched the first ever Venture fund for everyday investors in partnership with Cathie Wood’s ARK. We’ve been able to raise significant capital from some of Silicon Valley’s best, like a16z and General Catalyst.


Now let’s talk about you. We’re highly selective with who we choose to bring onto the team, but if you resonate with the above, we’d love to meet you.

**What You'll Do**

* Transform raw insights from the world of business and investing into deeply engaging, accessible, and fully-developed written work with little external guidance
* Curate, own and ship our daily newsletter to reach our audience of tens of thousands of investors and multitudes more of subscribers.
* Develop our narrative voice and the core communication practices we use to reach our engaged audience.

**Qualifications**

* Deep passion for writing and an innate ability to communicate complex concepts in an accessible and highly engaging written voice
* Strong familiarity with or background in investing, business, or technology
* Passionate about bringing access to historically guarded investment insights to a diverse and underserved audience of everyday readers and investors

* Comfort iterating quickly in deadline-driven environments
* Ability to work both independently and under close direction
* An acute attention to detail is a must
* Great communication skills and the ability to both give and receive critical feedback in a small team environment

### ***Compensation:***

*Pay per piece of content - $50-$150 per article*

*At Titan, we are committed to offering competitive compensation packages for our valued team members, matching our commitment to attract and retain a top talent pool that is aligned with our culture, mission, and values. This salary range represents Titan’s reasonable estimated possible compensation for this role at the time of this posting.*
