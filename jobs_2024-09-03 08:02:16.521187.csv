STRATEGIC CHALLENGES
  

  

The Operations Supervisor is the first line of support and supervision over the actual delivery of care and transport service for the operating division. The primary responsibility of the Operations Supervisor is to direct and support field personnel to ensure cost effective, professional delivery of service and care to customers/patients. The critical strategic challenges to this position include the following:  

* Changing customer expectations, including changes in the way care is delivered, potentially expanding services, or loss of services to other agencies (e.g., fire departments) have resulted in unclear or confusing role definitions. This results in changing employee expectations and lowered employee morale
* The growth-through-acquisition strategy has impacted all areas of AMR, resulting in the need for integration of processes and culture, which also impacts employee morale. The Operations Supervisor must deal with these morale issues daily
* Reorganization of work, which has resulted in role confusion for the Operations Supervisor. Some positions are focused on the supervision and support of reporting employees; other supervisors spend a great deal of time on data collection and reporting, leaving limited time for supporting employees
* Very large spans of control and employee shift structures make it extremely difficult for an individual Operations Supervisor to forge a strong relationship with the employees he/she is responsible for. This relationship needs to exist to support employee communications and coaching and development. In some locations, there are no assigned reporting relationships at all, which creates even more difficulty
* Changes in technology result in faster, easier methods for communicating, and collecting and analyzing data. The Operations Supervisor must ensure the implementation and proper use of such technology to maximize productivity and effectiveness
* The demands of the organization often exceed the time available for Operations Supervisors to do the work

  

**KEY RESPONSIBILITIES**  

* Ensure continuous quality improvement through clinical management and protocol compliance
* Investigate accidents and major incidents to gather information, resolve issues, and communicate findings
* Coordinate operations during times of disaster
* Gather information from customers regarding issues and problems, document complaints, and work with others for resolution to ensure customer satisfaction

* Provide daily direction and clarity of expectations to field personnel
* Collect information, conduct meetings and resolve issues with regard to employee problems, issues and concerns
* Coach employees to perform at their highest levels and provide performance feedback
* Assist employees in career planning
* Provide support to crews by acquiring needed resources
* Participate in the resolution of union or non-union grievances and administer the disciplinary process
* Communicate division and AMR information to field employees clearly, gather information from the field regarding company issues, and report and help resolve field-management issues
* Partner with human resources to ensure the availability of employee counseling as necessary
* Identify needs and support continuous improvement in employee development through training.
* Participate in orientation of new employees
* Administer company policies and procedures, as well as employment law in a consistent manner
* Interact daily with fire, police, hospital, physician group, nursing homes and other service providers regarding the integration and delivery of services and to manage the AMR image with facilities
* Participate in community service to enhance the image of the company
* Identify customer processes that lead to enhancements of service
* Supervise the daily operations of the field
* Collect paperwork and generate reports for management
* Assist crews in stocking trucks/units
* Ensure unit readiness by managing the fleet and materials
* Screen trip tickets
* Reinforce importance of complete, accurate, and timely completion of run reports
* Perform other duties as assigned

  

**KEY RELATIONSHIPS**
