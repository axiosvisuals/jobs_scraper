Progressive Hydraulics, Inc. (PHI) is a family-owned and operated business with an established history in Hydraulics for over 50 years. PHI is the leading Premier Full Line Parker® Distributor in NY, NJ and CT with ParkerStore™ locations throughout the Tri-State area.

We’re growing fast, and looking for a mechanically inclined, personable and naturally helpful person to join our team as a full time **Counter Sales Associate** in our **Fairfield, NJ ParkerStore™**.

**How we help you make the most of your skills**

We’ll provide product training and teach you about our business – the nuances of our Parker® Distributorship, fluid power (hydraulics, pneumatics and motion control) and what it takes to be a Parker® certified technician.

You naturally gravitate towards anything mechanical, which will help catapult you into a career at PHI that’ll cultivate your talents. We’ll be here to equip you with tools, knowledge and support from our Store Manager when you need it to achieve your goals.

In addition, you’ll take the initiative to provide the best service you can to help customers get their machines up and running in no time.

**What you need to bring to the table**

If you’d rather work alone on heavy equipment to avoid dealing directly with people, this isn’t the role for you. But if you like helping fellow mechanics get their machines up and running or enjoy mechanical puzzles to figure out, you’ll settle into this role just fine.

We’ll prioritize applicants who have worked on heavy equipment or in plant maintenance but we’re also willing to train the right candidate.

* **You’re mechanically inclined.** Tools, machinery and heavy equipment are in your wheelhouse – it’s where you’re the most comfortable because you can easily see how things work. Not only that, you can quickly identify what’s missing because you’re a natural observer. That’s why fixing things intrigues you – The thrill of getting something to work gives you a sense of pride and accomplishment.
* **Helping others is natural.** You’re our customer’s clutch hitter. When they come to the store, the clock is ticking and they need your help. You’re a problem solver who listens, comes up with a solution/part and follows through with the win in crucial situations. You’re also the type of person that if we can’t resolve their problem, you’ll go the extra mile to find someone who can…Because you were raised right.
* **You’re a “People Person”.** Dealing with people isn’t a problem for you because you’re personable and friendly. In fact, you enjoy being an expert they can rely on and trust.
* **Comfortable with basic math & a tape measure.** Using simple math (addition, subtraction, etc.) and a tape measure doesn’t scare you.
* **You’re Organized & Neat.**  You’re actually organized vs. saying you’re organized. In your mind, everything has its place, counter areas should be clean and merchandise should be displayed in a presentable manner.
* **You can Multi-task & lift up to 50lbs.**  You have a bunch of customers to tend to and some hose assemblies to finish for pick up. But that doesn’t phase you. In fact, you’ll greet, acknowledge and help every customer plus finish the hose assembly orders like a champ.
* **Proper Attendance.** You’re a contributor and take pride in what you do, which is why you value being punctual and showing up every day to do an outstanding job.
* **Bilingual Spanish is a Plus.** It’s not required but it could certainly be a tremendous asset.

**“So what’s in it for me,” you ask?**

At Progressive Hydraulics, Inc.we want to reward people for their contribution towards our success. We believe that the employees at PHI are family and our benefits are designed to ensure the health and financial wellness of that family.

Here are some of the benefits we offer

* Medical Insurance
