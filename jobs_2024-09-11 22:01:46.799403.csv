The Courant Institute at New York University (NYU) and the Center for Data Science (CDS) invite applications for a postdoctoral researcher to work with Prof Laure Zanna at the interface of climate modeling, biogeochemistry and machine learning.



The postdoc will perform research as part of the new multi-institution international project, InMOS (Integration of models and observations across scales), which aims to produce a robust global synthesis of the cycling, redistribution, and storage of carbon, oxygen, and heat in the ocean since pre‐industrial times.

The role of this postdoc position will initially focus on using the output of M2LInES. More specifically, they will help implement physics-based parameterizations into OCIM and MOM6 regional models, and assess the impact of the parameterizations on the mean state of the ocean. In parallel, or subsequently, they can develop new biogeochemistry parametrizations, in collaboration with the Princeton team. The postdoc is expected to actively collaborate with the entire InMOS (in particular, Profs Laure Resplandy and Pedram Hassanzadeh) and M2LInES project teams.

  



The position, available immediately, is a full-time appointment for one year, with the possibility of renewal for up to three years, subject to satisfactory performance and available funding.

This dedication was a testament to the unrelenting commitment that SPEAR providers have for their patients—the resilience the team demonstrated, and the innovative care provided to our patients–during the events of 2020 are what led SPEAR to be awarded “The Nation’s Top Practice” by the WebPT Ascend Conference. To be recognized during this historically difficult year was a proud moment for the organization and all our incredibly devoted team members.
  
  

In the years to come, SPEAR will continue its path of growth, with further expansion planned beyond the New York City Metropolitan region.

Years later, we’re honored to serve clean food to our communities around the globe.  

Our greatest strength has always been creating a menu with choices that feel good for everyone. Thank you to all the partners, farmers, producers and distributors that we proudly call friends & family. We source mindfully, with our farmers, our environment and our guests in mind at all times. We will always look to the future of food and plant-based proteins which are undoubtedly at the forefront of sustainability.

New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation

**Outposted** **Therapeutic** **Housing Units Program (OTxHU)**


Since 2016, Correctional Health Services (CHS) has been the direct provider of health care in the New York City jails. Deeply committed to human dignity and patient rights, CHS is part of the NYC Health + Hospitals system and is a key partner in the City’s efforts to reform the criminal-legal system. Our in-jail clinical services include medical, nursing, and mental health care; pharmacy services; substance-use treatment; social work; dental and vision care; discharge planning; and reentry support.




Given the high visibility of this initiative, we are seeking the highest caliber health care professionals in key clinical services to staff our Outposted Therapeutic Housing Units (OTxHU). To be located in three NYC Health + Hospital acute care facilities, the OTxHU is a pioneering approach to safely increasing access to high quality clinical care for patients in custody who have complicated health conditions. OTxHUs will bridge the gap in the continuum between care provided in the jails and inpatient hospitalization, with admission to and discharge from the OTxHU in accordance with a patient’s clinical needs. CHS will be the primary health care providers on these units and the NYC Department of Correction will provide security and custody management.




The OTxHU at NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue in Manhattan will be the first of this unique, groundbreaking project to open with a planned completion date as early as the end of 2024. This is an incredible opportunity to be part of a passionate and motivated team providing care to some of the City’s most marginalized, vulnerable people.

* To help support continuity of operations and care, staff selected to work in the OTxHU may also be required to work in CHS locations within the jails. Additionally, while CHS seeks the most qualified individuals for these positions, preference will be given to equally qualified, internal candidates.

WHAT YOU’LL LEARN:
As the media industry grapples with fragmentation and disruption, a key facet of Research is to be the driving force in helping their company capture, report on, monetize, and understand audiences. An opportunity lies in Research to work across divisions and departments to create a unified language that ensures that internal clients understand—and take advantage of—complex metrics. The key is giving the necessary context so that decisions can be made. While this sounds disarmingly simple, it is a challenge to get the majority of the company to speak the same language and understand new vernacular. Research is a central force within the broader organization in gaining an objective perspective for a wide array of complex questions. It may sound academic – and certainly there is a portion of the job that requires a love of learning – but the primary attribute that will bring you success is curiosity. For example, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of what motivates someone to tune into a show, buy a product based on placement of an ad, become a fan on social media, or why certain types of programs are successful across regions of this country and abroad. Ultimately, each research candidate gets a better understanding of the rigor that goes into making business decisions by uncovering not boulders, but pebbles along the path to connecting to A+E Networks core asset, its content.
YOUR STORY: [+BEHAVIORS] *(what you need to have)** Bachelor's degree in a related field (e.g., Media Studies, Communications, Statistics, Data Analysis).
* 2+ years of demonstrated experience in television, research, or data analysis
* Familiarity with the television and digital media industry, especially in the context of FAST.
* Advanced skill in Microsoft Office Suite, particularly Excel and PowerPoint, as well as Tableau
* Strong analytical skills, with an ability to identify trends and make insightful recommendations.
* Excellent communication skills with the ability to convey complex data insights to non-technical stakeholders.
* Detail-oriented, organized, and capable of managing multiple projects simultaneously.

For over 40 years, Nonprofit Finance Fund has provided these nonprofits and their leaders with capital, consulting, and thought leadership. As a community development finance institution (CDFI), we work with nonprofits, partners, and systems to build racial equity and community wealth and well-being. Our vision is a world of equitable prosperity, where communities of color and other systematically excluded communities have the capital, community assets, knowledge, and agency to thrive. You can learn more about our work to achieve that vision by reading our Strategic Plan for 2024-2026 and our commitment to racial equity.



None of this work would be possible without the incredible people who work here. Our team consists of a diverse group of passionate professionals who care deeply about racial equity and community wealth and well-being. You can read more about what it's like to work here – and read a few examples of ""a day in the life"" for NFF staff"" – on the careers page of our website.



Thank you for your interest in NFF. We hope you'll join us.

  


**About the Opportunity:**



The Director will have primary responsibility for overseeing Nonprofit Finance Fund's (NFF) BEACoN NJ Program, which currently aims to raise and deploy $20MM in flexible loan capital, and additional grant funding, to support a portfolio of debt investments that support nonprofits in New Jersey to acquire, develop/rehab, and operate assets that contribute to community wealth and well-being, as envisioned by NFF's larger Building Equitable Assets for Community Nonprofits (BEACoN) strategy. This will include affordable housing and nonprofit community service organizations. Loan products are expected to include acquisition/predevelopment loans with some combination of below market interest rates and credit-enhanced loans with flexible terms that leverage grant funding and concessionary capital sources. The fund is expected to be capitalized for 10 years.



The Director will have day to day responsibility for all aspects of Program management, including but not limited to: marketing, outreach, pipeline development and origination of new loans; ongoing monitoring and portfolio management of the loans; and coordinating the provision of technical assistance to program participants. Given the breadth of this scope and the early stage of this fund and program, the Director will prioritize three key responsibilities in the first 12 months: 1) deployment of capital to meet initial demand in the market and investor requirements, 2) capture ongoing market need and opportunity for continued deployment and 3) collect feedback and impact data for both internal and external purposes.



This position can be based remotely in New Jersey, and/or work from NFF's New York City office. There is a potential for up to 25-50% travel, primarily within New Jersey but occasionally out of state to attend conferences and funder/partner meetings.

  


**What** **you'll** **do****:**


***Deployment***


* Develop marketing materials, conduct outreach, and leverage existing and new relationships to generate interest and applications for financing from the Program
* Assess loan requests for mission/program alignment, impact, and credit quality

### **About Us**


Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.


U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.


U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/U--haul","http://www.uhaul.com/","2727 North Central Avenue
