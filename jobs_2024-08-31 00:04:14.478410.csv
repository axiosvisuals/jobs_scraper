FTI Consulting is the world’s leading expert-driven consulting firm. Over the last 40 years, FTI Consulting experts have served as the trusted advisor to Fortune 500 companies and the world’s leading law and private equity firms when they are facing their greatest opportunities and challenges. Our strong performance and continued success are a direct reflection of the ambition, energy, and commitment of our talented professionals across the globe to make a positive impact for our clients and communities.

  



At FTI Consulting, you’ll be inspired and empowered to make an impact on headline matters that change history. Working side by side with the world’s leading experts in your field, you’ll be surrounded by an open collaborative culture that embraces diversity, recognition, professional development and most importantly, you.



Are you ready to make an impact?

  


**About the Role**



FTI Strategic Communications is currently looking for a Director in our People & Transformation practice who will serve as a key client contact and lead project manager for organizational effectiveness, employee engagement and change management projects.

  




The successful Director must have a proven record working with clients undergoing complex changes and/or strategic transformations as well as a working knowledge of how to assess and influence key drivers of the employee experience and build leader capabilities. These complexities in our work make it extremely rewarding. They also require the successful Director to appreciate cultural nuance, anticipate and navigate change impacts across multiple stakeholder groups, successfully adapt to the pace and work styles of various organizations and teams, and apply creative problem solving – all with a strong understanding of and alignment to business objectives.

  



Additionally, a successful Director is confident working autonomously in an entrepreneurial environment, with the ability to manage up and down to ensure projects remain on schedule and on budget, anticipate and prepare for potential challenges and create new formats and strategies, where necessary, to meet a client’s objectives.

  




Some travel may be required including the possibility of being a key contributor to onsite client engagements – but this is NOT a traditional on-the-road consulting role. Travel is more the exception than the norm. Additionally, while we aim to help team members balance work and professional priorities, this is a client service position, and there will be needs that must be addressed outside the confines of the standard work day and work week.

  


**What You'll Do**



The Director will interact directly with clients on a day-to-day basis and serve in a variety of roles to support billable and non-billable efforts, from materials developer to counselor to implementer. Our team prides itself on maintaining an inclusive spirit in which all team members are encouraged to offer ideas and stretch their abilities on an ongoing basis. We work diligently to make opportunities available and all roll up our sleeves to support our clients and each other with tasks large and small. As a result, there is no such thing as a “typical day” for our team members, but you can expect your work will include the following:



Client Delivery


* Serve as a day-to-day client contact on accounts, managing the overall quality of work and representing the team in client meetings, email correspondence and while working at client sites
* Interpret qualitative and quantitative data to isolate cultural drivers and challenges, change impacts, change readiness, leader capability, etc. – be able to isolate the most important points and use inputs to inform strategic planning across key aspects of the employee lifecycle
* Develop communications and change management strategies and simultaneously execute a variety of tactics to reach all relevant stakeholders with timely and consistent information; be able to organize – and often visualize – strategies in a variety of formats to ensure understanding of responsibilities and timelines
* Create client-ready deliverables in a timely and efficient manner, involving and supporting junior team members as appropriate; ensure all approvals are secured in advance of key milestones
* Manage up and down – often across multiple teams – to ensure work is completed on schedule, at the right levels and in a tightly coordinated manner
* Develop and manage to client budgets, as required, and ensure billing and collections are completed on a timely basis
* Actively participate in new business development, including the development of client proposals, thought leadership and other related initiatives
* Establish and maintain solid relationships with clients and begin to build internal and external referral sources
* Help clients assess their program needs and introduce appropriate next steps from across the FTI Strategic Communications portfolio
* Participate in firm initiatives (e.g., learning and development, diversity and inclusion, community service and/or other task forces) designed to create a strong culture and/or build FTI Consulting’s brand externally
* Coach junior team members, helping to set SMART goals, providing ongoing feedback and support through continuous coaching and delivering thoughtful semi-annual reviews

  


**How You'll Grow**



Direct access to leadership with defined long-term career planning will ensure you continue to develop your skills as a client practitioner and trusted advisor with a keen sense of the business. You will continue to be challenged and gain on-the-job learning as you partner with internal teams in various specialty areas (both within Strategic Communications and with other segments) to tackle a myriad of client challenges across various industries. With an emphasis on a collaborative and flexible team approach, we all learn from each other as we support clients and continue to grow our offerings. More specifically, your individual growth will be supported through:


* Consistent Coaching: A dedicated coach will work with you to define goals, navigate any obstacles you may encounter and support your progress each step of the way. At the Director level, most of our professionals meet with their coach at least every two weeks. You should never be surprised in a performance review… it’s just a recap of the conversations you’ve already been having.
* Thoughtful Staffing: We believe it’s essential for our team members to gain a well-rounded skillset, with opportunities to discover their true passions over time. A centralized committee oversees the staffing of all client accounts to ensure you get the experiences you need to meet your goals as well as opportunities to work with – and learn from – a diverse set of senior professionals.
* Feedback Through Ongoing Client Work: Our team has adopted shared commitments to one another, including commitments to open communication and regular “feedback moments.” The documents you write don’t get lost in cyberspace. You won’t have to wonder if your presentation of your work went well. You’ll see how thinking evolves in real time, get clear feedback on your contributions and have opportunities to ask questions.
* Formal Training: Ongoing learning and development programs – ranging from internally led webinars, to online courses, to full change management certification – ensure you gain the skills needed to succeed at every level. Team members also provide ad hoc training as needs are identified, whether that’s understanding the bankruptcy process or co-creating a master list of what good quality control looks like. We are committed to investing in our talent.

  


**What You Will Need to Succeed**



Basic Qualifications


* Bachelor’s degree in a relevant field
* 5+ years of experience in communication and/or change management with a proven ability to manage change programs
* Prosci Change Management Certification, similar qualification, or equivalent experience
* Proven project management skills and the ability to proactively manage a client relationship in ways that achieve client goals and ensure all deadlines are met
* Proven people/team management skills and experience; candidates must demonstrate a strong desire to teach, an openness to differing points of view and an ability to remain positive under pressure
* This role requires travel to clients and FTI office(s)


Preferred Qualifications


* Excellent written and oral presentation skills
* Strong time and priority management skills and an ability to juggle multiple client accounts
* Desire and ability to work in a fast-paced, multi-tasking, deadline-oriented dynamic environment
* A high level of integrity and sensitivity to confidential information
* A service-oriented attitude
* A strong work ethic and an ability to be a self-starter
