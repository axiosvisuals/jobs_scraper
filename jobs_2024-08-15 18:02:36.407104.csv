(CFR)is an award-winning, innovative law and policy organization that serves primarily Black and Brown families and youth in Queens, Manhattan, and the Bronx with an interdisciplinary legal defense model that serves more than 2400 clients every year. In 2024, CFR will expand our family defense practice to Richmond County. CFR was originally founded in 2002 to dramatically change the trajectory of indigent parents being prosecuted by the Citys Administration for Childrens Services (ACS). Our goal is to defend and protect our clients rights, reduce the harm of family separation and prevent or minimize the time any child spends in the foster system.


CFR provides interdisciplinary family defense with a model that was unique at our founding and that is now being replicated nationally: we assign every client an attorney and a social work staff member, and teams have the support of parent advocates, who are parents with direct personal experience of being investigated and prosecuted by ACS. CFR was the first agency in the country to integrate parents with lived experience into legal teams and now has 7 parent advocates working in all three of our family defense locations. CFRsCommunity Advocacy Projectrepresents parents during a child protective investigation (to avoid court involvement where possible) and assists parents in clearing their names from state maltreatment records.


As an agency committed to securing justice for families, we built theYouth Defense practice (YDP)to defend youth at risk of family separation through incarceration. YDP uses the same interdisciplinary model to represent youth being prosecuted in Queens and Manhattan in Supreme Court Youth Parts, during Probation Adjustment and in Delinquency proceedings in Family Court. CFRs Home for Good program provides legal and social work services to CFR clients inimmigration,civil legal servicesandcriminal defensematters, to afford clients an efficient and well-coordinated one-stop solution to a range of issues that threaten family stability.


Recognized as experts in our fields,we annually train over 500 practitioners in the city, state and around the countryon strategies to promote family preservation and interdisciplinary representation, and we provide community based Know Your Rights presentations to parents, youth and service providers.We advocate at the city, state and national level for policies that reduce the harm of family separation, and promote parent engagement and justice for youth and families.

Litigation Supervisors are responsible for helping attorneys develop mastery in all aspects of litigation as well as in reinforcing and building upon skills and values introduced in initial and ongoing trainings. Litigation Supervisors write professional development reviews, periodically coordinate case practice and attorney workgroup meetings, and from time to time, develop practice materials useful for staff at CFR. Litigation Supervisors also work with family court staff and staff from other agencies, including ACS, to address substantive and operational issues that affect a large court-based practice.


The Litigation Supervisor will work with other Supervisors and Senior Staff as well as with the Director of Litigation, Director of Holistic Practice, Training Supervisor, Development & HR staff, and Executive Director to inform decisions on strategic planning and overall program development and improvement for the entire agency. In those areas, activities may include administration, hiring and recruitment, training, policy work, development, progressive discipline, fellowships, and appeals.
