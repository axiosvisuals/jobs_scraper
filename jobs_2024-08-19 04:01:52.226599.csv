We're currently hiring in our NY office and there are options to take leads in both Westchester & NYC. We are also hiring in our CT office.

The strategy we have works: High volume leads. One of our agents closed a $22 million sale from one of our leads. We have a sustainable lead system that is meant just for a small group.

**About Amo Realty**

Our company originally opened in Boston in 2007 (Boston City Properties was our first office). We expanded nationally. We currently have 13 very small offices in 13 states.

**Leads**

We give at least 20+ leads per week. The leads come in from a variety of sources. We've had the exact same system since 2007 and it works with a small group. We're under water leads.

*Residential leads:* We are flooded with residential buyer leads. The leads come from a variety of sources including Zillow. We do periodically provide seller leads, however the leads we provide are mainly buyer leads. There are also options to take on apartments renters and rental listings.

*Commercial leads:* The commercial leads that we have are mainly commercial lease leads looking for office space, restaurants, retail, industrial and more. There are also larger commercial investor leads.

**Training**

The system that we have works best for agents who have at least some experience. We do provide training, and it's mainly centered around technology to obtain clients and drip campaigns for follow-up.

**Split Info**

We provide clients with agents at a 50/50 split. Agent's own leads start off at 75% for the first 3 years. A $5,000 cap system for agents own leads is implemented for agents who have been with the company for 3 years. After the 3 year mark, agents keep 100% for the rest of the year for their own leads after $5,000 comes in on a 75/25 split. Company leads continue at a 50/50 split. It's a 100% split for agents that buy or sell their own properties.

There are no desk fees, no monthly fees, and no transaction fees.

The split is non-negotiable; please only apply if you are okay with the split system.

**\\*\\* We're looking for loyalty\\*\\*** 

Our lead system only works if we do not have any turnover. We have very low turnover, and the first agent ever hired in 2007 still works at our company. We need agents that are going to close sales and stay with us for the long run.
