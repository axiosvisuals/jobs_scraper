#WeAreCisco. We are all unique, but collectively we bring our talents to work as a team, to develop innovative technology and power a more inclusive, digital future for everyone. How do we do it? Well, for starters – with people like you!

  

Nearly every internet connection around the world touches Cisco. We’re the Internet’s optimists. Our technology makes sure the data traveling at light speed across connections does so securely, yet it’s not what we make but what we make happen which marks us out. We’re helping those who work in the health service to connect with patients and each other; schools, colleges, and universities to teach in even the most challenging of times. We’re helping businesses of all shapes and sizes to connect with their employees and customers in new ways, providing people with access to the digital skills they need and connecting the most remote parts of the world – whether through 5G, or otherwise.

  

We tackle whatever challenges come our way. We have each other’s backs, we recognize our accomplishments, and we grow together. We celebrate and support one another – from big and small things in life to big career moments. And giving back is in our DNA (we get 10 days off each year to do just that).

  

We know that powering an inclusive future starts with us. Because without diversity and a dedication to equality, there is no moving forward. Our 30 Inclusive Communities, that bring people together around commonalities or passions, are leading the way. Together we’re committed to learning, listening, caring for our communities, whilst supporting the most vulnerable with a collective effort to make this world a better place either with technology, or through our actions.

Since the Bubbakoo’s Burritos opened its doors in Point Pleasant, New Jersey back in 2008 it was apparent that this was a great place to relax and have an awesome meal. More than ten years later, Bubbakoo’s has expanded to dozens of locations across 10 different states and has served thousands of its legendary burritos to its very loyal customers.  

Despite the challenging economy, our founders Paul Altero and Bill Hart will continue to expand Bubbakoo’s Burritos one customer at a time. As opportunities arise, they’ll open new restaurants in neighborhoods where they can build bridges with local residents. Bubbakoo’s Burritos has proudly evolved into a community where people work, eat, and gather as a family.  

Together, Paul and Bill have created an ideal balance, not only for their partnership but the entire Bubbakoo’s family of staff and customers.  

Bubbakoo’s Burritos was an immediate success due to many factors. The high-quality food is fresh, made-to-order, and affordable for kids, families, and seniors. The restaurant is warm and friendly thanks to a well-trained staff, inviting design, and their dedicated franchise partners who continue to share the Bubbakoo’s way throughout the country.  

The roots of Bubbakoo’s are in the skater and shore scene, but all are welcome in what’s quickly become a neighborhood hub of activity. Paul and Bill realize service can be the deciding factor in a restaurant’s growth. They believe outstanding service and attention to detail have contributed to the tremendously positive word-of-mouth about Bubbakoo’s.

Since the Bubbakoo’s Burritos opened its doors in Point Pleasant, New Jersey back in 2008 it was apparent that this was a great place to relax and have an awesome meal. More than ten years later, Bubbakoo’s has expanded to dozens of locations across 10 different states and has served thousands of its legendary burritos to its very loyal customers.  

Despite the challenging economy, our founders Paul Altero and Bill Hart will continue to expand Bubbakoo’s Burritos one customer at a time. As opportunities arise, they’ll open new restaurants in neighborhoods where they can build bridges with local residents. Bubbakoo’s Burritos has proudly evolved into a community where people work, eat, and gather as a family.  

Together, Paul and Bill have created an ideal balance, not only for their partnership but the entire Bubbakoo’s family of staff and customers.  

Bubbakoo’s Burritos was an immediate success due to many factors. The high-quality food is fresh, made-to-order, and affordable for kids, families, and seniors. The restaurant is warm and friendly thanks to a well-trained staff, inviting design, and their dedicated franchise partners who continue to share the Bubbakoo’s way throughout the country.  

The roots of Bubbakoo’s are in the skater and shore scene, but all are welcome in what’s quickly become a neighborhood hub of activity. Paul and Bill realize service can be the deciding factor in a restaurant’s growth. They believe outstanding service and attention to detail have contributed to the tremendously positive word-of-mouth about Bubbakoo’s.

The quality and effectiveness of the products soon made Granado one of the official pharmaceutical suppliers to the Royal Court. For that reason, the brand was given the title of ‘Official Pharmacy of the Imperial Family of Brazil’ by the Emperor D. Pedro II, in 1880.

Emblematic in its country of origin, Granado has been passed down through the generations and is part of the Brazilian heritage.

Thereafter, Granado has opened stores throughout many European countries including France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, England, Greece, and Austria.

The quality and effectiveness of the products soon made Granado one of the official Pharmaceutical suppliers to the Royal Court. For that reason, the brand was given the title of ‘Official Pharmacy of the Imperial Family of Brazil’ by the Emperor D. Pedro II, in 1880.

Emblematic in its country of origin, Granado has been passed down through the generations and is part of the Brazilian heritage.

In 2013 the brand started its global expansion by opening its first concept store outside of Brazil, at prestigious department store Le Bon Marché in Paris. Thereafter, Granado has opened stores throughout many European countries including France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, England, Greece, and Austria.

We are hiring a Night Auditor!


We are looking for people that have a passion to serve others! Working at the front desk means you are at the hub of the hotel with the most interaction with our guests. The department is open 24/7….so each front desk role is as important as the others. Associates working the front desk are the key to the overall experience the guest will have. As the late shift you are essentially working without management supervision so your responsibility is seen as even greater as you assist in closing out the business for the day as well as check in or out those guests during non- traditional hours. Your keen sense of being proactive, responsive and caring will make all the difference. The night shift also assures the guest a stay that is safe whereby you are monitoring abnormal activity inside and outside of the hotel and monitoring any weather issues that could become threatening to our resting guests. If you enjoy working semi-independently from others and have a winning personality and high sense of responsibility – this role is perfect for you! We have a great company culture at Concord Hospitality where everyone is valued and treated with respect.


Role Responsibilities:


As a Front Desk Night Auditor you have the responsible to give our guests the best hospitality experience they can have by:
