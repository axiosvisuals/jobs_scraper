**Recruitment/Posting Title** Human Neuroimaging Faculty Positions in Rutgers Brain Health Institute
  

**Department** RWJ - Brain Health Institute
  

**Salary** Commensurate With Experience
  

**Posting Summary**
The Center for Advanced Human Brain Imaging Research (**CAHBIR**), a component of the Rutgers Brain Health Institute (**BHI**) on the Busch campus in Piscataway, NJ, is recruiting for multiple faculty positions at all levels (Assistant/Associate/Professor). We seek investigators who use innovative MRI approaches to image human brain structure and function. Individuals who utilize additional approaches such as EEG, tDCS and rTMS to study human brain function would also be attractive. Applicants must have a doctoral degree, and a research program with currently active US federal funding. Applicants with an MD or MD/PhD are particularly encouraged to apply. Quality of research and fit within one or more of the **four focus areas of** **BHI** are important criteria. Ideal applicants would have federally funded research programs in neurology, neurosurgery, pediatrics, psychiatry, otolaryngology, or other clinical departments. We offer a highly competitive salary and an excellent start-up package.  

With over 300 neuroscience faculty labs engaged in basic and clinical research, and proximity to New York, Princeton and Philadelphia neuroscience communities, the BHI and CAHBIR offers tremendous collaborative opportunities and core facilities to support and grow an active research program. Outstanding core facilities will support this position, including a new research-dedicated 3T Siemens Prisma MRI scanner, EEG and TMS facilities and a human behavioral testing core developed and operated in collaboration with Princeton University. CAHBIR was established in 2021 and has rapidly grown to provide an intellectual focal point for Rutgers researchers conducting basic and translational research on the human brain in health and disease. Our faculty intersect with key BHI centers at Rutgers, including the **Alzheimer’s and Dementia Research Center**, the **Addiction Research Center**, and the **Center for Autism Research, Education and Services**. In addition, CAHBIR faculty collaborate with the Rutgers-Princeton Center for Cognitive Computational Neuropsychiatry (**CCNP**), which forms the core of a recently established Conte Center examining neural and computational mechanisms of latent causal inference processes in psychiatric illness. Cognitive science research is facilitated by the Rutgers University Center for Cognitive Science (**RuCCS**). Through the **Rutgers Institute for Translational Medicine and Science**, an active NIH CTSA, and affiliation with Barnabas Health, the largest hospital network in the state of New Jersey, Rutgers offers unique opportunities for **participant recruitment and clinical trials** to speed the translation of research discoveries into improved patient care.  

New Jersey is a progressive state with a highly diverse population, and Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, values a culturally diverse faculty; we strongly encourage applications from female and underrepresented minority candidates. Applicants should submit a CV and statement of research accomplishments and plans, to Dr. David Zald, Director of CAHBIR and Chair of the search committee, at **bhi@bhi.rutgers.edu**.
