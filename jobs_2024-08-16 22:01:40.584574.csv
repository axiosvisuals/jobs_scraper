This position will carry an annual revenue goal.
This Performance Seller position is based in New York with domestic US travel as needed, occasional visits to the product/engineering offices in Mountain View, CA. You will report to our Performance Sales Lead. If you're interested in joining a rapidly growing team working to build a unique, world-class advertising sales organization with a relentless focus on data and customer experience, you've come to the right place.
As an individual contributor, you'll be supported by our world class ad operations team and will benefit from working with a leadership team that is chartering our explosive growth.
Responsibilities:* Build strong relationships with named advertisers, agencies, and programmatic trading desks

In support of the extraordinary care services and luxury living amenities we provide for our residents at The Bristal, we are seeking experienced, dedicated and upbeat **Lifeguards** to maintain a safe recreational and therapeutic environment for our residents in the outdoor pool. We open our pool on Memorial Day Weekend and it stays open until Labor Day Weekend, so this will be a seasonal position for the summer. But we are starting to recruit candidates now in preparation of our opening — and for the right individuals, this can be a fun and personally rewarding experience. In addition to being especially watchful of residents at the pool, you will also, at times, be helping them get in and out. On days when the pool is closed or there is inclement weather, you may be asked to help out in assisting with daily activities in the recreation department, as well. In this position, you will come into direct contact with residents who choose to call The Bristal home. So, above all, we look for professionalism, but also a kind and patient spirit. The loving care and attention you bring to the services you provide are fundamental to the quality of life and the general safety and wellbeing of our residents during the summer.
