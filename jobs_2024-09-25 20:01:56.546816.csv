**ALL ABOUT ON DEMAND**

  

You can work as much or as little as you like as an On-Demand TM and your schedule may vary depending on shift availability and store needs. This role is ideal for those that are looking for a personalized work schedule.

  

As an On-Demand TM you will not be included on the posted weekly schedule, but rather will have the opportunity to create your own schedule by picking up shifts posted by leaders or other team members (via our myTime mobile scheduling app) that work best with your schedule.

  

We require your active engagement by picking up and working shifts as well as responding to our attempts at contact.

  

We will contact you throughout the year (via your provided contact information) and confirm your interest in working shifts at Target. If we do not receive a response to our communication attempts, your employment with Target will be administratively terminated.

  

 Regular attendance is necessary and we require your active engagement by picking up and working shifts once every 4 weeks (minimum of four hours). Flexibility can be granted if you are unable to work once every 4 weeks due to a personal circumstance, but you are required to respond to our attempts to contact you to confirm your interest in working shifts at Target. You must work at least one shift within 6 months or you will be administratively terminated. Effective December 2024, you must work at least one shift within 5 months or you will be administratively terminated.

  

Your communication and ability to work when our business demands it most are critical to your success in this role.

  

Should you be offered a position as an On-Demand TM, you will be required to attend a Target Welcome orientation and commit to a short-term structured training schedule to ensure you are properly prepared for your new role. After that, the myTime mobile scheduling app is where you can pick up the shifts you desire to work.

Wirecutter is seeking a motivated testing logistics manager to join its editorial operations team.

You’ll be tasked with finding new ways to organize and track products (both at our office in Long Island City and remotely), create unique testing setups in our testing space, and coordinate needs across our catalogue—including panel testing, taste tests, and more.
You will report to and work closely with our deputy director of editorial operations. This position is a tremendous opportunity for someone with an innovative approach to operations. This role is New York-based.
Responsibilities:* Manage our testing projects in our Long Island City facility, creating budgets tailored to unique needs, booking outside services like Taskrabbits or movers, and working directly with journalists on day-to-day logistics
* Collaborate with our editorial, photo, and video teams to provide resources and support, and solve any logistical roadblocks surrounding testing
* Iterate on our inventory tracking system to receive, organize, and catalogue products both at our LIC facility and remotely so our journalists always know how to find a product
* Manage all shipping and handling for testing products—from product orders to receiving products at the office to donating products once we’re done with them
* Oversee our cross-functional testing calendars, building long-term testing plans and communicating upcoming in-office testing to our newsroom
* Partner with our editorial operations manager to align our testing priorities and calendars with broader editorial plans and priorities
* Work closely with our company operations team to understand how upcoming repairs, changes, or upgrades will affect our testing efforts and adjust accordingly
* Strategically assess and iterate on our testing logistics process and workflows to remove any barriers to our journalism
* Recruit, supervise, and develop members of the testing logistics team, providing guidance, tools, and direction
* Demonstrate support and understanding of our value of journalistic independence and a strong commitment to our mission to seek the truth and help people understand the world.


Basic Qualifications:* 5+ years of professional experience in a product testing, inventory, or project management-based role
* 3+ years of experience working cross-functionally as a leader and people manager
* Extensive experience creating and maintaining internal systems, processes, and databases, especially inventory tracking
* Extensive experience managing a production, studio, or similar workspace with projects or events to coordinate
* Extensive experience juggling various priorities, assignments, and stakeholder relationships simultaneously
* Proficiency with Google Workspace, Airtable, Slack, Miro, and other project and database management tools


Preferred Qualifications:* Experience with product testing or reviewing products
