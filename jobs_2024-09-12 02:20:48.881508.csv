**About Us:**



Competitive triathletes and passionate bakers, Pam Weekes and Connie McDonald left their careers to open a small bread shop in New York City in 1995 — Levain Bakery.  

One day, they baked a BIG chocolate chip walnut cookie as energy for triathlon training. At Levain, a batch of these 6-ounce cookies flew off the shelves, and an icon was born. The cozy shop on West 74th Street became a neighborhood favorite and a destination for epicurious visitors from around the world, hungry for “the cookie.”  


From the start, Pam, Connie and team baked everything fresh on-site each day, donating the day’s leftovers to charity — and we still do, nearly 30 years later. Today, Levain has bakeries across the country (with more to come!), plus ecommerce gift boxes to treat cookie lovers in every state.  


Every day, we strive to embody our company’s five core values:
* Welcome All- *we are all in it together*
* Work Hard and Be Nice- *we go above and beyond*
* Lead with Heart- *we do the right thing*
* Rise Up- *we are proactive*
* Savor It- *we are present and find the fun!*","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Levain-Bakery","http://www.levainbakery.com","New York","2 to 10","less than $1M (USD)","","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/1497c6aa21dc80b7a30bd7185f92e8ca","","",""

**Baldor** **History**



When Louis Balducci rented a pushcart for $5.00 a week in 1918, little did he know that he was laying the foundations for Baldor Specialty Foods. In 1946, Louis opened a fruit stand called Balducci’s Produce in Greenwich Village that flourished into a beloved specialty food shop. Food writer James Beard was a regular customer and noted that Balducci’s always sold “the best of the best, at the right price.”



A family business from the start, the company employed numerous family members including son-in-law, Kevin Murphy. Murphy ran Balducci’s wholesale division, Baldor, so passionately that the Balducci family encouraged him to establish the business as an independent entity in 1991. Over the next decade, Baldor sustained continuous growth while maintaining the standard of excellence that made Balducci’s a success. The company cemented its reputation for sourcing expertise after introducing blanched frisee to the American market. Murphy named it “Circus Frisee” after famed restaurant Le Cirque.



Today, Baldor is the leading importer and distributor of fresh produce and specialty foods in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. The company is headed by Kevin’s son, T.J. Murphy, C.E.O. Under his leadership, Baldor remains committed to customer service, quality, and innovation.



Baldor Specialty Foods has a long legacy of quality, consistency, and service. Under the leadership of the former Owner and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Murphy, President Mike Muzyk joined Baldor in 1996 and today works closely with Kevin’s son, TJ Murphy, who has been the Owner and Chief Executive Office since 2013. Under the leadership and partnership of TJ and Mike, in the last seven years, Baldor has achieved consistent double-digit growth in addition to geographic, category, product and channel expansion.

When Louis Balducci rented a pushcart for $5.00 a week in 1918, little did he know that he was laying the foundations for Baldor Specialty Foods. In 1946, Louis opened a fruit stand called Balducci’s Produce in Greenwich Village that flourished into a beloved specialty food shop. Food writer James Beard was a regular customer and noted that Balducci’s always sold “the best of the best, at the right price.”



A family business from the start, the company employed numerous family members including son-in-law, Kevin Murphy. Murphy ran Balducci’s wholesale division, Baldor, so passionately that the Balducci family encouraged him to establish the business as an independent entity in 1991. Over the next decade, Baldor sustained continuous growth while maintaining the standard of excellence that made Balducci’s a success. The company cemented its reputation for sourcing expertise after introducing blanched frisee to the American market. Murphy named it “Circus Frisee” after famed restaurant Le Cirque.



Today, Baldor is the leading importer and distributor of fresh produce and specialty foods in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. The company is headed by Kevin’s son, T.J. Murphy, C.E.O. Under his leadership, Baldor remains committed to customer service, quality and innovation.



Baldor Specialty Foods has a long legacy of quality, consistency and service. Under the leadership of the former Owner and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Murphy, President Mike Muzyk joined Baldor in 1996 and today works closely with Kevin’s son, TJ Murphy, who has been the Owner and Chief Executive Office since 2013. Under the leadership and partnership of TJ and Mike, in the last seven years, Baldor has achieved consistent double-digit growth in addition to geographic, category, product and channel expansion.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Baldor-Specialty-Foods","http://www.baldorfood.com/","155 Food Center Drive Bronx, NY 10474","1,001 to 5,000","$100M to $500M (USD)","","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/e3b9819e55268c9e7c73e5714df9a2f2","","",""

**About Us:**



Warby Parker was founded with a mission: to inspire and impact the world with vision, purpose, and style.



We're constantly asking ourselves how we can do more and make a greater impact, and that starts by reimagining everything that a company and industry can be. We want to demonstrate that a business can scale while doing good in the world, without charging a premium for it. And we've learned that it takes creativity, empathy, and innovation to achieve that goal.



Since the day we launched in 2010, we've pioneered ideas, designed products, and developed technologies that help people see. We offer everything you need for happier eyes at a price that leaves you with money in your pocket, from designer-quality glasses and contacts to eye exams and vision tests, and you can meet us online, at our stores, or even in your home. Wherever and whenever you need it, we're there to make exceptional vision care simple and accessible. (Delightful, too.)



Ultimately, we believe in vision for all, which is why for every pair of glasses or sunglasses we sell, a pair of glasses is distributed to someone in need through our Buy a Pair, Give a Pair program.","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Warby-Parker","http://www.warbyparker.com","New York","501 to 1,000","","Marby Parker was founded with a rebellious spirit and a lofty objective: to offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price, while leading the way for socially conscious businesses.","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/56f2123c26a1b1e8687851d8f0ef08d2","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_headerimage/1960x400/49ea419eaf79e3492df75cdfc33ccee7","Neil Blumenthal",""
