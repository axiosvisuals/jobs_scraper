Our diverse workforce is uniquely focused on empowering New Yorkers, without exception, to live the healthiest life possible.

**SUMMARY OF ESSENTIAL DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:**  

The Engagement Navigator will work under the direction of the Engagement Manager as a member of the Special Populations Care Management Program. The Engagement Navigator is an integral member of an interdisciplinary team within the emergency room (NYC Health + Hospitals Acute facilities) and community to provide outreach services that seek to establish a bridge to longitudinal forms of healthcare and care management. The team members utilize their interpersonal skills to develop a rapport with the patient during their stay in the emergency department and continue outreach to them after they leave the hospital through phone calls and fieldwork. The Engagement Navigator will support patients in feeling empowered and self-directed in their healthcare journey and bridge them to long-term care management resources.


The Engagement Navigator will be responsible for the following:  

* Coordinate with the Engagement Manager to create a plan for reaching patients in the ED to address their immediate needs and assess potential care coordination opportunities.

* Complete outreach activities, such as diligent search activities, as required for IPA patients not actively engaged in treatment.
* Complete patient-centered referrals and linkages for non-IPA patients to existing resources and referrals.
* Conduct fieldwork to continue the patient relationship and bolster patient engagement with longitudinal healthcare resources as needed.
* Complete required documentation in a timely fashion to reflect patient engagement, outreach, provider collaterals, and case conferences. Complete preliminary screenings and treatment goals with objectives as outlined in accordance with programmatic requirements.
* Participate in quality assurance and quality improvement initiatives and activities as required.

The position will also conduct clinical visit to medical respite sites, overseeing care plans for patients, coordinating delivery of clinical services, determining medical clearance, and supporting respite staff with discharge planning

**Systemwide Clinical Consultation:** This position will provide skilled and timely clinical advice at multiple points throughout its housing system. This consultation may include providing advice to referring partners prior to HFH referral, liaising between systemwide referral points and Housing Location and Placement Services vendor, and consultation with on-site providers at H+H contracted interim or permanent housing sites to problem solve specific client issues including triage of clinical need, and linkage to specialty care, primary care, behavioral health services, and other community resources.

Our schools help students grow to become empathetic, ethical, intellectually curious young adults committed to solving the world's problems. Other key program elements in Hebrew Public's New York City schools include the Responsive Classroom model, Expeditionary Learning, Close Reading, Wilson Reading System, Eureka, Number Stories, Fundations and Geodes.

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea.

That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

Position Information
**Recruitment/Posting Title** Student Assistant
  

**Job Category** Staff & Executive - Research Support (Laboratory/Non-Laboratory)
  

**Department** RWJ-RINTS
  

**Overview**
New Jersey’s academic health center, Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS) takes an integrated approach to educating students, providing clinical care, and conducting research, all with the goal of improving human health. Aligned with Rutgers University–New Brunswick and collaborating university wide, RBHS includes eight schools, a behavioral health network, and five centers and institutes that focus on cancer treatment and research, neuroscience, advanced biotechnology and medicine, environmental and occupational health, and health care policy and aging research.  

  

Our faculty are teachers, clinicians, and scientists with unparalleled experience who advance medical innovation and provide patient care informed by the latest research findings. We offer an outstanding education in medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, public health, nursing, biomedical research, and the full spectrum of allied health careers.  

  

Our clinical and academic facilities are located throughout the state—at Rutgers University–New Brunswick, including Piscataway; and at locations in Newark, Scotch Plains, Somerset, Stratford, and other locations. Clinical partners include Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, Newark’s University Hospital in Newark, and other affiliates.  

  

Through this community of healers, scientists, and scholars, Rutgers is equipped as never before to transform lives.
  

**Posting Summary**
Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, is seeking a Student Assistant for the department of Neurology at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.  

  

The mission of the lab is to follow a network-based approach to understand the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (mainly Parkinson’s disease and secondarily Alzheimer’s disease), with the ultimate aim being to utilize this strategy to develop combination treatments. This strategy distinguishes our lab from a decades-long tradition in the field of zeroing in on specific genes and focusing on the development of monotherapies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Simultaneously, the lab aspires to remain at the cutting edge in terms of cellular and molecular biology techniques and to advance the neurodegeneration field by developing innovative tools and technologies that we will share with the research community. To achieve those goals, we are currently using mammalian cell lines (including stable cell lines) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSc) as model systems, as well as human brain tissue. In the future, and as our research program advances, we will expand our toolkit to also include mouse work and computational analyses of large -omics datasets. Some of the techniques we use include standard cell and molecular biology techniques, flow cytometry, microscopy (standard imaging and FRET, FLIM, FRAP), high throughput genetic and chemical screens, single cell and spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, lipidomics, genomics, optogenetics and histology. Lab website: eleannakaralab.com  

  

At least one individual will be hired. We are hiring individuals for a) pure wet lab roles, and b) hybrid wet lab and bioinformatics roles.

S/He will work in a new lab as part of a highly integrated research team utilizing a variety of laboratory technologies and approaches. Appropriate training in all techniques necessary for the project will be provided. The incumbent must have a genuine interest in research and in the work undertaken in our lab and be committed to improve their research skills and progressively develop research competence; those attributes will be assessed during the interview. Exceptional support will be provided to the recruits in that direction, and it is anticipated that the incumbent will take full advantage of the training and professional development opportunities provided. The applicant will join in ongoing research projects. Contributions to our research will be appropriately acknowledged through co-authorship on published manuscripts.  

  

Among the key duties of this position are the following:* Carry out studies with cultured cell lines and iPSc derived neurons.
* Optimize assays to model and study specific disease processes of neurodegenerative diseases and miniaturize them to enable high throughput screens.

**Our values demand that we be curious, self-aware, fearless, consistent. We say yes to seemingly insurmountable challenges because we dare ourselves to push further. And we go the distance because we are individually and collectively entrepreneurial, always asking: Why can’t it be done? We find a way because we care more than the competition. We embrace team and disown ego. We are ruthlessly disciplined and unabashedly kind. We unreservedly challenge the status quo and vigorously fight for new levels of excellence. We believe the difference between good and great is exceptional communication. We obsess over creating value for our team and our customers. We push ourselves and our industry to be more inclusive, to champion diversity and to fight racism, gender bias and all forms of inequality. We never peak.**
