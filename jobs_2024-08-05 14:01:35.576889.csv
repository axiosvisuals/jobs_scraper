**About the East Harlem School**

**Our mission:** The East Harlem School challenges students to develop a balanced physical, moral, and intellectual strength that they will use to adapt to change - and for the final purpose of creating and sharing lives of deep meaning, dynamic actions, and transcendent joy. We are a middle school (grades 4-8) that recruits children from families with low income and the highest values, and we give preference to those who keep to the traditional belief that creative flight can only be sustained by grounded discipline.

**Our history:** Exodus House has been an anchoring and iconic institution in Harlem since its founding in 1963 by Reverend Dr. Lynn and Mrs. Leola Hageman as a drug rehabilitation center. Due to a heightened concern for the welfare and well-being of the community’s many underserved, at-risk children, Exodus House was converted in 1984 to an after-school and summer program facility. Then, in the fall of 1993, inspired by the steadfast commitment of the Hagemans to the East Harlem community, the couple's sons, Hans and Ivan, opened an independent year-round middle school on the original Exodus House site to better address the critical needs of these children and their families. The East Harlem School is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.

**How To Apply**

Interested candidates should email a cover letter and resume to kennis@eastharlemschool.org. Please include “Math Teaching Position” in the subject line of your email. Qualified candidates will be contacted for a phone and/or Zoom interview if they are being considered for the position.
