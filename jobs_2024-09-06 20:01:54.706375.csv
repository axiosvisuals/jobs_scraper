FLSA Classification: Non-Exempt

About the Position:

Storytellers are at the heart of the experience at the New Jersey Hall of Fame’s (NJHOF) Entertainment

contextual storytelling about New Jersey’s inspirational heroes, hospitality services (including admissions

and retail sales, line management, crowd control, wayfinding, etc.), and assisting with the delivery of

public programs.

The Ideal Candidate:

You’re perfect for this role if you’re great at striking up conversations with people of all ages and

backgrounds—even in awkward situations! Whether you are greeting guests, providing tours, checking

tickets, or selling merchandise, they understand what it means to be “on stage” and will always maintain a

friendly, eager, service-oriented demeanor when in the public spaces. You are naturally curious and

driven to learn more about the NJHOF and the impact its inductees have made! You would describe

yourself as charismatic, high-energy, resilient, and personally accountable.

What You’ll Do and Be Responsible for:

* Provide a welcoming and engaging guest experience to everyone who comes to the ELC—this is

the guiding principle for this role and everything you do at the ELC.

* Greet guests to the ELC with enthusiasm, setting the tone for the experience and making a good

first impression. This may take place at the ELC or elsewhere on the American Dream property.

* Guide visitors through the exhibit experience: talk to them about inductees, provide info about

artifacts and displays, and sign them up for timed exhibits/programs.

* Skillfully address guest concerns and/or escalate to supervisor(s) as warranted with the goal of

ensuring guests feel (and are!) valued and heard.

* Sell admission tickets, season passes, and upsell applicable add-ons.
* Sell NJHOF merchandise in the Jersey Shore Gift Store including photo concessions.
* Facilitate and support public programming and marketing events such as appearances by Hall of

Famers, educational programs, workshops, and expo-style events including setup/breakdown.

* Ensure the ELC is always guest ready. This means that exhibits are in working order, workspaces

are photo-ready, velvet ropes and stanchions are straight, merchandise shelves are neat and

presentable. This includes light-duty cleaning (e.g., sweeping up discarded trash off the floor).

* Pick up and transport ELC deliveries and merchandise from shipping and receiving, and

unpacking, breaking down, and properly disposing of packaging.

* Keep up to date on what’s going on at the NJHOF, ELC, and American Dream.
* Other duties as assigned.

Qualifications:

* Passion for New Jersey history, culture, and achievements
* A high school diploma or equivalent (GED); some college preferred
* Strong communication and interpersonal skills and comfortable with public speaking
* Previous guest services, customer service, or equivalent experience strongly preferred
* Previous cash-handling experience preferred; must be able to perform basic math in a fastpaced,

retail environment

* Discounts on dining, experiences, and merchandise at over 70 different restaurants, stores, and

to lift 30 pounds is required. The position requires the ability to walk on concrete floors, climb stairs,

bend/lift/stretch, tolerate loud environments, maneuver through crowds, and perform public speaking.

Employees will also work in brightly lit and dark/low-light conditions. This role also requires the ability to

exposed to varied weather elements.

\\*The physical requirements described above are representative of those that must be met by an

Obtaining scientific results from these experiments requires complex software and computing systems, developed by international teams of researchers over decades. The resulting scientific data sets are among the largest in the world.
The successful applicant(s) will be part of the Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics (IRIS-HEP, http://iris-hep.org/), which is developing innovative solutions to the computational and data challenges of the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC), which will collect data starting in 2029 and continue into the 2030's. Our research program also includes detector component simulation and data reconstruction algorithms of the key4hep software ecosystem being developed in the context of the future collider community (specifically Future Circular Collider (FCC) and muon collider concepts). The candidate(s) is expected to play a leadership role in one of several R&D projects, including research into highly performant data analysis systems, the application of novel machine learning techniques to HEP, and/or the implementation of other innovative event reconstruction algorithms for HL-LHC and future collider concepts. The successful applicants will also have the opportunity to do their own research on the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at the European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland.
For additional information, contact Dr. Peter Elmer (Peter.Elmer@cern.ch). This position will be based at Princeton University, at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland or at Fermilab near Chicago, Illinois, subject to discussion with the principal investigator.

We are seeking a GM to lead this effort.



This is a unique and exciting role, calling for someone with a special combination of product, business, and go-to-market skills. We need a leader who can take a big ambiguous problem — at the industry level — and turn it into a successful product and business, in short order. For the right person, this is a once-in-a-lifetime career opportunity with massive upside.



This role is ideally based in our New York office, with the ability to travel frequently to our San Francisco HQ, but other locations will be considered provided you can travel frequently to New York. Substack's compensation package includes a market competitive salary, equity for all full-time roles, and exceptional benefits. Our cash compensation salary range for this role is $180,000 - $230,000. Final offer amounts are determined by multiple factors including candidate experience and expertise and may vary from the amounts listed above.


**Responsibilities**


* Inspire and lead a team of engineers, designers, and analysts tasked with building a new mode and use case for Substack
* Work directly with key partners building on top of Substack to help them achieve their goals and shape the Enterprise product
* Fully own the short, medium, and long-term roadmap for the Enterprise product
* Manage key external relationships with media organizations and platform partners
* Own a critical P&L for the business and determine how to best allocate budget and resources in service of hitting ambitious goals


**Requirements**


* **Domain expertise:** a foot in two worlds: media, and high growth technology companies. Understand the media industry's past, present, and future — and the ability to craft a compelling vision for its next chapter.
* **Business development:** an ability to forge and manage the most important external relationships for the company
* **Product sense and product management:** must be able to effectively PM the entire Enterprise product team during the zero-to-one phase of the effort
* **Execution:** a scrappy ability to make tons of fast progress with a small startup team, and comfort operating at every level of abstraction (from high level product/business strategy to ""how should this paywall logic work"" level details)
* **Communication:** strong written and verbal communication skills — must be able to write a compelling strategy doc or launch post, and present to the the company and external partners regularly
