StaffCo is a Professional Employer Organization, commonly referred to as a PEO, duly organized and registered under the New York Professional Employer Organization law. StaffCo and SUNY have entered into a professional employer agreement under which StaffCo is the employer of Stony Brook Clinical Practice Management Plan employees and responsible for all aspects of employment, including hirings, promotions, disciplines, terminations, the day-to-day direction and supervision of work, as well as labor relations and collective bargaining. StaffCo is fully responsible for providing all payroll and human resources services, including the payment of wages, collecting and reporting payroll taxes and maintaining any and all employee benefits. SUNY Stony Brook Hospital is responsible for the operation of the hospital and provision of health care and is the co-employer as is necessary to conduct its responsibilities and for related licensure, regulatory or statutory requirements and obligations.

  

Given StaffCo’s employment responsibilities, it is deemed the “employer” for employment and labor law purposes. Thus, the employees are private sector employees of StaffCo, not public sector employees of SUNY. The private sector nature of the StaffCo employees has been approved by NYS Civil Service and upheld in a decision by the US National Labor Relations Board.
